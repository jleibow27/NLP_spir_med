I was sharing my vision and trying to compensate that I am not delusional or superstitious.  I do not know if many of the things I share are fact or that if I am the Sun God, don't be silly.  But the Sun did plummet and compress into a more optimal state as I was molding it with my will.  So enjoy the time we have left before it explodes in an cosmic calamity annihilating much of this wonderful solar system in a super nova sometime, billions of years from now, or any minute now, who knows.  \n\nI am not a scientist, I'm all cerebellum, cerebral cortex deactivated years ago, all reptile here.  However, I do not just want to fill people's heads with bullshit.  So it's hard with me to give a complete documentation of everything I have experienced.  \n\nIn my experiences though with psychiatry, or incidents with the police.  Often things aren't documented of a religious or paranormal nature... Like, when you pull the paper work, instead of religious or paranormal terms, names or references - it's like as impersonal or vague as possible.  So those people should burn for these ignoramus protocols.  They're gone to burn, folks, burn, burn, burn, in the Lake of Fire.  You're gone burn.\n\nI get frustrated from time to time with the ignoramus bullshit I have endured not only through psychiatry and the police but by people in general.  I placed way to much faith in believing in people and these organizations.  I mean, people just want to cover their own asses or just flake out, I have suffered a great deal at what fucked up pieces of shit some people are.  You have your expectations of these organizations, or people, have none.  Have no expectations of anyone, unless it's negative and underwhelming.  I do not insult people or their intelligence or expect people to be incompetent.  It would save you a great deal of displeasure or disappointment if you do so.\n\nI mean, we have the media often romanticizing these organizations, medical, law enforcement, for the most part.  You have live documentation as well, the camera helps people perform best.  So the camera always needs to be on.  You would see less Barney Fiver mother fucker obese policeman and night blade Doctors in this hell hole of a world.\n\n\nSo in the end you often have yourself to depend on and I'm grateful.  I do not struggle to hard with this, I'm mostly just disappointing in my expectations that things would go better.  I just keep getting screwed in most situations.  I'm used to it and prepared now for bullshit to come in the future.\n\nI am doing well, morale is good and I just find myself compensating less and less. I'm an slightly out of the ordinary Man with desires and enjoy earthy pleasures and things.  I may leave something to be desired in those spiritualists looking for closure or a God that loves them and meets all their needs and queer desires.  I do not really give a fuck about you or your kids, call a welfare organization.\n\n\n\n\nCheers", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 72199, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Insanity and Psychiatry and all", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e64enx/insanity_and_psychiatry_and_all/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "HeisenbergTheSavage", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4o2iqn9g", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575487660, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e64d2h/this_is_really_fucking_deep_when_you_read_it_its/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e64d2h", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 114, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e64d2h/this_is_really_fucking_deep_when_you_read_it_its/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575487664, "score": 1, "selftext": "\u201cThe Matrix is a system, Neo.

It was me and some other people, were all sitting in a circle and he made us all slit our fingers and play a \u201cgame\u201d. One guy refused to do it so he died. So I made sure to do it. \nThe devil knew EVERYTHING about everyone! Anyways I saw him becoming nicer and nicer during the dream. And he revealed his childhood to me. He wasn\u2019t the only \u201cdevil\u201d. There was a lot of devils actually. he didn\u2019t want to be evil but that was how he was raised. Anyways somehow I ended up carrying his baby for him. (Weird)... \nand he was becoming really nice. It was like he didn\u2019t want to be the bad guy. \nI don\u2019t know if this was just a crazy dream or what. \n\nIn a weird way I didn\u2019t wake up scared or anything. I actually felt quite happy and peaceful which is really strange.

That is not to say we still aren't facing struggles, but a lot of these struggles are now internal. Before, life was about staying alive. Wondering where our next meal was to come from. Being on the physical grind. Survival is a relative term, as you will see. But now, we're starting to focus on the mental grind. It's because we, as a species, have figured out how to survive. That's not to say a lot of us are not still on the physical grind, those born into less fortunate situations. But those of us on this sub are generally on the same page. Society taught us to go to school, get a job, and save our money. But what does that really accomplish nowadays? We do that, yet we have this feeling of \"now what\". I know several people making 6 figures, yet they feel the same way I do working a low wage job, wondering whether I return to school to get sucked into some office job just so I can be financially comfortable. There will still be a void. So what difference will it make if I'm making 30,000 a year or 300,000 a year. A bigger house? A nicer car? Ok, so now what? You see the pattern? How about 1,000,000 a year. An even bigger house? An even nicer car? Ok, now what? Material things are distractions. They keep us occupied in this life so we don't have to face the existential questions. But we will have to answer to them eventually. Comfort isn't the endgame, it's a placeholder. So though we may become successful by societal standards, what does that societal success mean to us? There are \"jobs\" that have meaning in this life, but most don't. Do you really want to be someone's office slut, doing the dirty work for the top so they can spend their money they made off of your work on prostitutes and drugs? Sure they'll throw you a bone, give you a bonus. Give you some time off. But those at the top do not hold the same values as those of us at the bottom. How could they? It takes a cold heart and a fake persona to make it to the \"top\" of society. Politics/economics is a dirty game. So we turn to enlightenment to find meaning. Enlightenment is the future. It is the key to the chains that keep us shackled, mentally and physically. Surviving in today's world is living to the expectations of others. Living is creating expectations for yourself. That goes for people of all circumstances, no matter how poor or how rich. Now for the questions most of us are facing. What expectations do we expect ourselves to meet? How do we go about them? How can we find them even? The answers are individual specific. I just hope we can reach them :) Maybe those of you who have found some of the answers could share how you found them.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 72128, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Enlightenment is the future", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e5xjq0/enlightenment_is_the_future/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "R3volutionzz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2wbm80v9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575452907, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e5wxp2/i_am_not_worthy/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e5wxp2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e5wxp2/i_am_not_worthy/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575452908, "score": 1, "selftext": "Lets say.

I\u2019m appreciative of my existence as if it\u2019s an exclusive experience. \n\nBut my connection with *whatever spiritual relationship* I have always experienced just is.

Growing up I often felt as if I\u2019m  different than the average person. In a sense being alone, even around people. \n\nLast March I decided to try mushrooms for the first time. I prepared myself well for the experience I was about to pursue. Fasted for 12 hours, cleared my mind of any negative thoughts and energy, etc. I ate about 3 grams, and it was crazy. \n\nI\u2019m not gonna talk about the visual effects, but the mental ones. I was all alone for the first half of my trip, in my room. It was only me and my mind. It was truly an out of body experience. It was like the universe was trying to teach me a lesson.\n\nI could feel my spirit leave my body and I traveled and explored the spirit word, and was fully connected to my higher self. Part of me felt like I died and was reborn. I seen the worse side of things, and the best side. I basically took a tour of the afterlife. \n\nMy mind went places I didn\u2019t think it could go, I had basically fell down a rabbit hole deep in my conscious. It was expanded more than it ever has and allowed me to see things for what they truly are and to have a deeper understanding of life and everything around me. Maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s illegal? I\u2019ll save that topic for another time. \n\nI would consider my trip a bad trip, simply because I was scared..terrified actually. Super intense, but eye opening. And it was because it was so eye opening it was a good trip in the long run. I learned a lot, and still have a lot more to learn. I know I didn\u2019t really go into detail about my trip, so if you have any specific questions..feel free to ask. \n\nBut I feel as if everyone should try any type of psychedelic drug, atleast once. It opens you up to a whole new world and it\u2019s an experience of a lifetime. Fully open yourself up and explore the deep depths of your mind, and gain from it. \n\nThank you for reading, I\u2019d love to have a deeper discussion about this topic. It is super interesting to me. The fact that something that exist here on earth, can open you and your mind..to something supernatural.

Most possibly I\u2019ve slipped up and let beliefs seep in and for that I\u2019m sorry, because I don\u2019t want to pollute anyone\u2019s journey with my passing thoughts.\n\nThis is at best a highlight reel and is written to be a literal, physical recount of my Dark Night rather than a spiritual journey. I did this primarily because I wanted to make sure that anyone who has a similar experience to mine can see they are not alone in their pain or their remedies. I\u2019m always happy to discuss wherever my head was or is at, so just ask if interested.\n\nYou can always reach out to me.  If I don\u2019t respond, keep trying me every hour if you\u2019d like until I do, as I miss plenty of messages.\n\nUltimately, I Love each and every one of you and even though we\u2019ve never met, I see you all as my friends, I see you all as my family, and there is nothing that can ever change that. Sorry in advance for any times I'm a dick.  One for All and All for One.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe point that I mark the beginning of my Dark Night of the Soul may be 3, 10, or 20 years past it\u2019s true start, but rather than make guesses about its lead-in, I mark its start the moment it hit terminal velocity, the moment a 50 pound brick flew through the air and smashed into the side of my face, leaving me upon contact in a dimension of my own, contained within the dimension I had just been in.\n\nI had just moved to Europe from the US 2 days earlier to take a position at a company that was lucrative, was wrong for me, and had been decided on because it made me feel important \u2013 pretending not to hear the voice that said it was a mistake.\n\nI was standing in a hotel room with my wife after having had a morning of intense stomach pain that I hadn\u2019t felt since my spiritual death/awakening 20 years before, when I looked at the shape of the European electrical outlet and my world went upside down and inside out,  and I turned to my wife, cutting her off with \u201cStop talking, stop talking right now. Something bad just happened, and I\u2019m going to be homeless and alone within a year\u201d.\n\nI ran downstairs thinking maybe being outside would calm me down, but my old reality no longer existed and in this new one, \u201ccalm\u201d, was only relative to the terror I was trapped in.\n\nWhat happened in that moment I looked at the outlet?  1 feeling and 1 thought.\n\nThe feeling: A claustrophobic panic. Blind, frantic panic. I have to get out of here right now. I\u2019m trapped. I can\u2019t breathe.  FEAR. TERROR. Such incredible terror that I couldn\u2019t believe it could happen in real life.\n\nThe thought: I\u2019m trapped in the infinite Universe. There\u2019s no way to get out. There is nowhere I can go that will make this go away.  I may have cracked something in my mind I shouldn\u2019t have, something that\u2019s not supposed to happen. I\u2019ll never be able to live like this. I\u2019m going to lose everything and die alone.\n\nFor the next 7 hours I fought it. I walked the streets in Europe saying out loud to myself \u201cDon\u2019t think of that! Don\u2019t think of that!\u201d every time a thought came into my head that brought the panic closer to the point of no return. I believed if I let the panic take hold completely, if I gave into it, that it would cement in my mind and I would believe I could never beat it. I fought for my life those 7 hours, then when my wife was too cold to walk anymore, we went back to the hotel, I took a handful of anti-anxiety pills, spent another hour pacing the limited hotel room floor, and got into bed.  For the first few hours, every time I was about to fall asleep, I would jolt awake thinking maybe the feeling was gone or it had just been a bad dream. But I could feel it still, simmering underneath. Something was very wrong, and it felt like a nightmare had become real.\n\n14 months later I felt like I was finally starting to get better. Those first 7 hours the only time I had kept it at bay. 14 months of being doubled over in pain 50% of the time, grunting when I exhaled to try and lessen the stomach pain. 14 months of the people around me unable to conceive of what I felt. Other\u2019s questions of what dinner glasses we should set the table with were met with my horror that oh my god no one really understands at all what is happening to me, no one understands how serious this is. I used to get so upset and I\u2019d say \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m standing here on fire and you\u2019re asking me if I\u2019d prefer rice or potatoes. I\u2019m telling you I\u2019m on fire and your actions are making no sense to me. Why aren\u2019t you acting like I\u2019m on fire?\u201d.\n\nThat was one of the things, no one did understand, no one could comprehend. Not doctors, not family, no one understood the scale of the pain. No one could conceive the size of the battle.\n\nFor the first 7 months I had no idea anything spiritual was happening. I told several people this had nothing to do with my awakening/death from 20 years before. Because there was no insight, there was no growth (or so I thought), there was only terror, and pain, and the dismembering of my future, and the certainty I was going to lose everything and everyone. No spouse, no family member, no Doctor had any idea of what I was trying to explain.  They would give me printouts from websites that promised a panic attack would only last 15 minutes and then a person would get tired and fall asleep \u2013 even though I had just finished telling them my attacks would last for days if not weeks and in between there was still the panic, the fear I had lost control of my life and that this was how people ended up spending the rest of their life in a locked and padded cell. And the \u201cin between\u201d might not last for more than 30 minutes, or 5 minutes, or 2 hours, before I couldn\u2019t breathe or stand up straight again. Trapped in eternity. Trapped in the infinite Universe.\n\nThey told me to breathe, they said to be mindful, they told me to meditate for 10 minutes a day. Someone downloaded an iPhone app. It felt like everyone in the world was acting crazy (crazier than usual). I would go home and scream in pain, or scream in anger and frustration, or cry. I\u2019m not a big fan of alcohol but by the end of the first four months I was drinking 2 liters in about 10 hours \u2013 and I could almost not feel it through the panic and terror. The alcohol over the first ten months worked less and less as I drank more and more. In the beginning a drink or two might buy me an hour of peace (relative peace), but by the end it seemed to only increase my pain.\n\nI had thoughts that the pain may never end, that I would never feel even okay again. And I would wonder how long I could go before I decided to kill myself.\n\nWith the alcohol now often intensifying the pain instead of relieving it I turned to cocaine, lots of it. Sometimes it would help, often it would help the panic. I was in such pain that my wife, who got tremendous anxiety at the thought of me doing cocaine because she was petrified I was going to die, on several occasions looked at me and said \u201cThat\u2019s it, we\u2019re making a call and getting you drugs, no one should have to suffer like this\u201d. And trust me, if my wife is telling me she is getting me drugs then to her it must have looked like I was already dead.\n\nWhile this was going on I had been looking for a psychiatric facility I could check into \u2013 not because I thought much of most psychiatrists, but because my family did and when you are asking someone to be okay with you drinking 2 liters of liquor a day and shoving tons of cocaine up your nose, I feel it\u2019s a wise move to try one of their \u201csocially accepted\u201d remedies so they feel like you\u2019re still tethered to reality and are trying to get better. Also, I did have a small amount of hope that somehow this would be normal to someone, that there would be some answers for me.\n\nMaybe this is a good time to explain that though for decades I had not wavered in asking God/The World to do whatever it needed short of killing me to help me continuously become a better, more fair, kinder, more enlightened person (to take me as far as possible), I had never read any spiritual, religious, or \u201cself-help\u201d book beyond the first couple pages, I had never meditated in my life, I knew no one who was in any way connected to that world, had never read or studied philosophy, read no books at all actually in 20 years other than Harry Potter, and the only beliefs/thoughts/philosophy I had were based on what I saw in myself and others, what I believed and felt in my heart, and the ideas, insights, and thoughts I worked through. So while I have been very spiritual most of my life, the point is I had never heard of a Dark Night of the Soul.  The point is the first time I read something that used the words \u201cAwakening\u201d or \u201cSpiritual Death\u201d was 20 years after I had been calling what happened to me an awakening and spiritual death. I did listen to a lot of music, and they were like my lost family. I heard similar stories there. But I\u2019m explaining this so you understand why I didn\u2019t do the things you might expect someone who had studied would do and why I didn\u2019t understand what was happening.\n\nI found a private psychiatric program in Boston and flew there when they had their first opening. It was a two-week program, but I left in four days as it was just not the right thing. At that point my wife and I decided to move back to New York so I poured myself several large drinks, took the train there from Boston, checked into a hotel, and had a dealer dropping off baggies within 2 hours.\n\nI tried one more medical solution because my wife had been reading about intravenous ketamine infusions and she had her hopes pinned to that treatment \u2013 so I signed up for the suggested round of 6 infusions and stopped after 5 with no change beyond the experience (why we stopped is a story for another story).\n\nThen\u2026\n\nOne month later I was up very late at night when out of nowhere my head started exploding with fully formed ideas and insights as though they had been placed inside me already worked out. Synchronicity was visible in its full effect, and my eyes\u2026my eyes had been given one hell of an upgrade. Thoughts of unconditional Love and self-Love were suddenly in my head. It was 8 1 /2 months since my stomach pain started, and that night it stopped.\n\nThe anxiety and panic however stayed, which had its own kind of stomach pain. New thoughts of the impermanence of things brought on huge panics, like an unswaddled baby.  The terror was as bad if not worse than ever. But at least now I had some direction. At least I knew this was a spiritual issue (experience) and so I could stop looking for a medical remedy and instead dive in and explore (and often times run away, but there was nowhere to hide).\n\nMy own lack of unconditional self-love - me not being enough for myself, the reason I believe for my fear of being left alone with no one to reflect me (and I think a key reason for a Dark Night) rose to the top of the pile. I had an all too real dream that I was on a fiery planet with someone I loved \u2013 no one else was on this planet, and God said if we chose to stay (I felt like it was our turn to be on the planet) that we would be there for a trillion trillion years. We said we\u2019d stay and as soon as we said yes there was an explosion and my voice became a fractal (that\u2019s what I called it in my dream) \u2013 basically it became digitized and unintelligible. Suddenly I started to panic, I could no longer communicate with the person I was with, the person I Loved who gave me safety. Then there was another explosion and I lost my hearing. The panic and claustrophobia were spinning out of control. Then another explosion and I went blind. And I was sobbing because I couldn\u2019t find the person I was with and I was in a panic because I was trapped and how would I make it through this for trillions of years, and then I could hear God (substitute anything that works for you here) in my head saying that no matter how bad it got or how long it lasted I would forget it once it was over, because it was all like a ketamine trip, all of life was like a ketamine trip, because when you died you forgot everything that had happened to you, so even though this experience was going to be torture, one day it would be over and then I wouldn\u2019t know it ever happened, like a bad dream you don\u2019t remember.\n\nThere have been many thoughts, many insights, many repeated old habits that sometimes take the wind out of my sails and sometimes happily humble like progress. There was a morning maybe a month after that dream where I looked at myself in the bathroom mirror and realized even though I didn\u2019t want to die I might have to kill myself to get away from the panic and anxiety. That was a hard moment but now that it\u2019s in the past it\u2019s a cherished piece of understanding. That was December of 2018.\n\nThings went on and still do, albeit without the panic attacks or most of the insanity. It\u2019s now November 2019. That first night in the European hotel was March of 2018. My consciousness, my eyes, my ears, my mind \u2013 they are not the ones I started this journey with. My heart has been amplified and can get intoxicated from the messages my other senses now feed it. Empathy, Love, devastation, Liberty, kindness, giving.\n\nIn my opinion a Dark Night of the Soul is not just a feeling, it is a state of mind and a state of being. I don\u2019t know if it can be done without pain and terror, and while I truly never want to feel that again (because I\u2019m petrified of it, still scared it would last forever, and I just don\u2019t think I could live very long), it took experiencing those feelings to open my mind to many things, and it was for me like a second death, as the person I was before is already fading fast from my memory.\n\nI read somewhere that God will ease or stop the pain if you ask. So if you\u2019re in a lot of trouble I pass that information on, though I\u2019m not sure if it works or not, and I\u2019m not sure if I asked for it to stop, but I think I have a vague memory of it though it could be imagined. Either way, much of it for now has.\n\nBest of luck and remember, even if something is able to hurt you, it never has a right to, which means you can never be beaten, even if you are (now you can no longer say you know nothing).\n\nLove you.", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried where I could to leave current personal beliefs out of this and to stick to a recounting of what happened during my Dark Night. Most possibly I\u2019ve slipped up and let beliefs seep in and for that I\u2019m sorry, because I don\u2019t want to pollute anyone\u2019s journey with my passing thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is at best a highlight reel and is written to be a literal, physical recount of my Dark Night rather than a spiritual journey. I did this primarily because I wanted to make sure that anyone who has a similar experience to mine can see they are not alone in their pain or their remedies. I\u2019m always happy to discuss wherever my head was or is at, so just ask if interested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can always reach out to me.  If I don\u2019t respond, keep trying me every hour if you\u2019d like until I do, as I miss plenty of messages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I Love each and every one of you and even though we\u2019ve never met, I see you all as my friends, I see you all as my family, and there is nothing that can ever change that. Sorry in advance for any times I&amp;#39;m a dick.  One for All and All for One.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point that I mark the beginning of my Dark Night of the Soul may be 3, 10, or 20 years past it\u2019s true start, but rather than make guesses about its lead-in, I mark its start the moment it hit terminal velocity, the moment a 50 pound brick flew through the air and smashed into the side of my face, leaving me upon contact in a dimension of my own, contained within the dimension I had just been in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had just moved to Europe from the US 2 days earlier to take a position at a company that was lucrative, was wrong for me, and had been decided on because it made me feel important \u2013 pretending not to hear the voice that said it was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was standing in a hotel room with my wife after having had a morning of intense stomach pain that I hadn\u2019t felt since my spiritual death/awakening 20 years before, when I looked at the shape of the European electrical outlet and my world went upside down and inside out,  and I turned to my wife, cutting her off with \u201cStop talking, stop talking right now. Something bad just happened, and I\u2019m going to be homeless and alone within a year\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran downstairs thinking maybe being outside would calm me down, but my old reality no longer existed and in this new one, \u201ccalm\u201d, was only relative to the terror I was trapped in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What happened in that moment I looked at the outlet?  1 feeling and 1 thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The feeling: A claustrophobic panic. Blind, frantic panic. I have to get out of here right now. I\u2019m trapped. I can\u2019t breathe.  FEAR. TERROR. Such incredible terror that I couldn\u2019t believe it could happen in real life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thought: I\u2019m trapped in the infinite Universe. There\u2019s no way to get out. There is nowhere I can go that will make this go away.  I may have cracked something in my mind I shouldn\u2019t have, something that\u2019s not supposed to happen. I\u2019ll never be able to live like this. I\u2019m going to lose everything and die alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the next 7 hours I fought it. I walked the streets in Europe saying out loud to myself \u201cDon\u2019t think of that! Don\u2019t think of that!\u201d every time a thought came into my head that brought the panic closer to the point of no return. I believed if I let the panic take hold completely, if I gave into it, that it would cement in my mind and I would believe I could never beat it. I fought for my life those 7 hours, then when my wife was too cold to walk anymore, we went back to the hotel, I took a handful of anti-anxiety pills, spent another hour pacing the limited hotel room floor, and got into bed.  For the first few hours, every time I was about to fall asleep, I would jolt awake thinking maybe the feeling was gone or it had just been a bad dream. But I could feel it still, simmering underneath. Something was very wrong, and it felt like a nightmare had become real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;14 months later I felt like I was finally starting to get better. Those first 7 hours the only time I had kept it at bay. 14 months of being doubled over in pain 50% of the time, grunting when I exhaled to try and lessen the stomach pain. 14 months of the people around me unable to conceive of what I felt. Other\u2019s questions of what dinner glasses we should set the table with were met with my horror that oh my god no one really understands at all what is happening to me, no one understands how serious this is. I used to get so upset and I\u2019d say \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m standing here on fire and you\u2019re asking me if I\u2019d prefer rice or potatoes. I\u2019m telling you I\u2019m on fire and your actions are making no sense to me. Why aren\u2019t you acting like I\u2019m on fire?\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was one of the things, no one did understand, no one could comprehend. Not doctors, not family, no one understood the scale of the pain. No one could conceive the size of the battle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the first 7 months I had no idea anything spiritual was happening.

Just want to wrap it up for those that like to stay on Reddit. It\u2019s a bit long so without further delay, How to Contact your Guides, a discussion I channeled with one of my guides, a being called \u201cZero\u201d: \n\n(Just in case you\u2019re new, I\u2019m the questions and Zero\u2019s answers follow in quotations.)\n\nCan anyone contact their guide?\n\n\u201cYes. Any being may communicate with their guide or guides. We would say, since all beings are inherently connected already to their guide, all beings are already in contact with their guide. but for the purpose of this sharing of information, we want to help you recognize their communications\u201d\n\nAre people born with the ability to talk to your guides or can it be learned?\n\n\u201cWhile some beings may incarnate with more sensitivity to their guide\u2019s communications, all beings have the same ability level. You are all always connected to and in contact with your guide.\u201d\n\nCan your guide leave you?\n\n\u201cGuides can come and go as would have been agreed upon to some degree before your incarnation on Earth (or elsewhere). Some will stay with you during your entire incarnation, or over multiple incarnations, while others may be with you only for a certain stage in your life. None will leave or arrive before or after you need them to. Your are in constant support.\u201d\n\nIs there a best way to connect to your guide?\n\n\u201cThere is no best way to communicate with your guide. There is only your way. While there are some generally common ways people do this, even while falling into those commonalities, the mechanics of this communication are specific to you and your guide. It is an absolutely unique connection and not falling into a common way in no way reflects inaccessibility or an inability to communicate. Unless of course you would like to believe that. We don\u2019t recommend that belief system but it is always your choice.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of communication with a guide?\n\n\u201cThe answer to this is very specific to each individual but generally speaking they are with you to assist your growth during your incarnation. Incarnation to a physical form is quite a challenge. You are moving from a place of total recognizable connection to all that is, to a form where you appear separate from everything. It was decided that an actor point of sorts be provided, especially in Earth\u2019s case, to help.\u201d\n\nWhat type of information can they give us?\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking they are there to provide support while you encounter different experiences during incarnation. This may come in many different ways depending on the relationship of the being and their guide.\u201d\n\nDo we need to ask for protection?\n\n\u201cThis is part of a much larger topic we would like to discuss in the future but from our point of view calling for protection creates a vibration of energy that says you need to be protected from something that could interfere. That may lead to the creation of an experience where something is trying to interfere, made by you.\n\nWe recognize that some of you may believe that there are potential dangers out there, so in that case, you might want to call upon Source, protective beings, or create a shield of some kind, whatever you feel is necessary to help you build up the confidence that you have a safe connection.\n\nAs an alternative, instead of asking or creating some form of protection, we\u2019d like to offer the idea of taking a moment each morning or before you want to begin communication, to remember not only are you supported by the Sun, the Earth, the planets and the stars, you are at a fundamental level, an immortal being made from Source itself. That the creative energy that flows through and creates the universe flows through you as well.\n\nWe would like to encourage the belief that the connection between you and your guides is a sacred connection created by you and your guides before incarnation into this realm. One of which that is so intrinsically connected to you, of such a high vibration, that no outside source may interfere, interject, modify, or silence it. You are all powerful beings beginning to remember your true potential with nothing to fear.\u201d\n\nAre their crystals or stones that might help create a more clear connection?\n\n\u201cThese are not required but some may find them helpful to build confidence. We would suggest stones that support grounding and communication. Black Tourmaline, Amethyst, and Sodalite.\u201d\n\nIs talking to your guide the same as channeling?\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking channeling is reaching out to a being or a being reaching out to you who is not connected to you in the same intimate way your primary guide is. That said, in a way you are channeling information in a very similar fashion so it may fall into that categorization.\u201d\n\nIs there a way we should expect the messages to come through?\n\n\u201cIt would benefit you to not place expectations on how you feel communication should occur. As we\u2019ve mentioned it\u2019s a highly personal experience and the methods of communication vary wildly. It could be from anything: audible words or sounds, downloads of information, general feelings, smells, communication via dreams states, symbolism, visions, muscle twitching, to thought forms that aren\u2019t your own, etc. The method isn\u2019t important, it\u2019s the message.\u201d\n\nDo guides have names? Although my guides respond to a name, I get the distinct impression that\u2019s not their actual name. Some, including you, have said as much.\n\n\u201cNames are useful during physical incarnation but are not always required when you are non-physical. Identity is communicated vibrationally so a marker is not needed. There are also instances where the name cannot be translated in a way humans can understand or say. In cases like this, they will give you a new name you can use while communicating with them. In many cases you yourself may choose this name.\u201d\n\nHow can we learn to recognize how we are connecting to our guides?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to encourage people to have fun with this. You have a tendency to lean towards ritual and reverence ( Dave interjecting here: He\u2019s talking about me in this specific instance \u2013 thanks for the personal share btw, Zero haha), and while that can be perfectly fine if it serves you, it isn\u2019t necessary and sometimes heavies your frequency. All beings are equal. Reverence is fine as long as it\u2019s equally given to yourself and recognized in all things.\n\nThis is a very personal and exciting process to begin to explore. And while these methods will help you take big steps in recognizing your communication with your guides, this is often a lifelong practice and as you move along in your life it will continue to grow and develop.\n\nHere are some methods you can use to begin to recognize your guide\u2019s messages\n\nIncrease your Awareness\n\nMeditation. Mediation helps you to focus your mind so that you begin to notice with more ease new information. Begin a regular practice of meditation for a few minutes each day that includes body awareness. This will increase your sensitivity to new messages in any form.\n\nNoticing your conscience or gut feelings. Your conscience, gut feeling, and intuition are often you receiving communication from your guide. This is dependant on the individual and how you personally feel in situations like this, but when faced with an issue where you aren\u2019t able to use conscious reasoning, notice the feeling of your conscience and your \u201cgut\u201d feeling. Notice your emotional feeling as well as your physiological feelings and take note of them.\n\nHave you had a moment where you felt your intuition was correct or a sudden feeling made you change your mind about a decision you had to make? Reflect on those moments. Note what the situation was and how you felt when you made your new choice. How did you feel emotionally? Physically? What were your thoughts? It will help you to be specific. Was your gut feeling truly in your gut? If it was a sudden knowing, what did that knowing feel like?\n\nImagine your Guide\n\nSpend time imagining the characteristics of your guide. Draw, write, or visualize how your guide looks or feels. Does something about it feel incorrect? Does something feel accurate? Have fun with this and pay attention to how you feel when making choices.\n\nAsk your guide a Question\n\nBegin asking your guide questions and pay attention for an answer and how it comes in. Ask about something from your day to day actions. Something simple and has low emotional impact as they might your emotions might get more focus than your guide\u2019s message. For example ask \u201cwill the store have the thing I\u2019m looking for?\u201d and then pay attention to how you feel. It doesn\u2019t have to be a direct yes or no, just how you feel. If that is unclear, ask your question again but this time answer it yourself with a \u201cYES\u201d and then see if saying that word felt good or less good. Next say \u201cNO\u201d and see how that feels. If still unclear, compare back and forth, saying \u201cYES\u201d to that question or \u201cNO\u201d until you\u2019re sure you know which feels better. Then go to the store and check. Repeat this test as much as you can in as many situations as you can. Again, keep them on simple things with low emotional impact. If you\u2019re not getting accurate responses at first, don\u2019t give up. It\u2019s a practice. Doing this hones your ability to consciously communicate with your guides and increases your confidence which also increases your ability.\n\nAsk for Assistance\n\nYou all have the power to communicate on your own because as we\u2019ve discussed earlier, you have been doing it since before you incarnated here on Earth or elsewhere. But if you feel like you might need some assistance there\u2019s certainly nothing wrong with that. Reach out to an intuitive being you trust and resonate with to help you. Focus your questions on how your guides might be communicating with you and how can you increase your ability to notice their messages. Assistance from an intuitive being can be incredibly valuable but we\u2019d like to gently encourage you, after the assistance and when you feel ready, to strive to develop this ability to the point where you can recognize your guide\u2019s communications without the assistance of others.\u201d\n\nThanks so much for this, Zero.\n\n\u201cThank you, David. We\u2019re excited to participate and be of assistance during this great shift we\u2019re experiencing together.\u201d\n\n\nSince I made a more clear contact in Japan (more on this later since this article is getting long) and realized in a way my brain could understand as really happening, I felt like I had this partner with me at all times and I often find myself just talking to them like I would a friend. I\u2019d really encourage you to take steps in the direction of developing your communication with your guides. It\u2019s been invaluable to me.\n\nAs always, keep the information that resonates with you and leave the rest, but I\u2019m hoping you do find value here and I wish you (and your guides) good luck on your path together.\n\nSee you soon,\n\n~Dave", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 72061, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How to Contact Your Spirit Guides", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e5sezn/how_to_contact_your_spirit_guides/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "R3volutionzz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2wbm80v9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575425938, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e5s5yv/lifting/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e5s5yv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e5s5yv/lifting/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575425940, "score": 1, "selftext": "Lift up.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 72053, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Lifting", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e5s5yv/lifting/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "knowing222", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kgk46ln", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575425449, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e5s26u/memory_sparks/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e5s26u", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e5s26u/memory_sparks/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575425451, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve been getting sparks of memories from when I was a young kid in like the past few days.

I felt like they intentionally put a ton of guilt on you so that you\u2019d keep coming back, thus keep donating. \n\nI got really sleazy vibes from the pastor too. I felt like he and some of the young women that were assistants at the church mighta had extra stuff going on behind the scenes...\n\nAlso, when I was a little kid (3-4 years old) I always had this inherent fear of the church. I could sense bad vibes and the people there scared me. I gave up on being a Christian when I saw how people would always go to the Bible for any kind of problem or advice. And I hated how there was no such thing as thinking for yourself. When a Christian hears something (facts) that don\u2019t agree with them, they close their eyes and cover their ears. \n\nI always think of a little 3 year old kid. Would they ever know about Jesus if you didn\u2019t tell them? \n\nAnd why do Christians love to tell people they are \u201cgoing to hell\u201d or have \u201cbeen deceived\u201d if you don\u2019t believe anymore. \n\nI still believe Jesus lived on Earth, but I believe the Bible was meant to control and mislead people. I think of Jesus as the highest vibrational being to have ever lived, and an example of how to treat fellow humans. \n\nBut I reject the brainwashing that comes from the Bible.

And forget everything you know.\n\nAnyways, ***according to literature***, Columbus was told that he's delusional and that the great sea was infested with monsters like the kraken. And which conclusion was more rational after all, now that we think about it? A round planet or a sea infested with monsters and if you sail far enough, you will fall off the edge of the Earth. **It doesn\u2019t matter if this really even happened or not, take it as a metaphor.** Boundaries of the psyche, is a metaphor for what the sphere meant to Columbus.

Those are religions of wealth, control, terror, gender disequality, war and scammery. Religions created by fools. Religions of false prophets. Man doesn\u2019t control the Nature, woman does. You were born into your religion, I was born Christian, but always questioned the whole concept. Question yours. How rational is it that people from different parts of the world believe in different gods? That makes no sense, or does it? One says Allah is the god, and the other ones say, \"noooo, it's the bearded old dude instead, shut your mouth, fool\". Very fucking logical, right?\n\nThere is no heaven and hell, like the bible teaches Christians. Nor 40 virgins waiting for you in the heavens when you die. There is only a heaven, which we are currently living in. When you die you just simply [reincarnate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation) , and [karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_in_Hinduism)  is what decides which species of conscious creature you will reincarnate as. Your soul is immortal, but your ego isn't. When your soul changes it's physical body, only your memories etc. will get \"erased\", but those memories aren't gone however. I have literally seen myself being a lion in my past life. All of us have had good karma in our past lives, since we were born as humans, so be grateful for not a being an eyeless worm, or a cockroach etc.\n\nThe only way to make that kind of \"God-system\" rational would be that the so-called ground of being resides in each of us. (consciousness) That way nobody has the power over other. I think you got my point there, so here's how DNA, God, consciousness and the Universe are all related;\n\n^(physics, psyche and psychedelics are strongly related)\n\n[The Queen](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/d5lqgn/i_drew_my_dmt_entity_encounter/), [the ground of being](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/db42a9/hi_i_remember_you_ive_heard_others_refer_to_you/), God, or whatever you wish to call [Her](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Para_Brahman) , that creates and is our consciousness, operates somewhere, where time and space are both irrelevant. Even though they\u2019re the most relevant, to us, and for Her. Somewhere, where everything we know is irrelevant. Just so we could experience time. And space. And individuality in a sense of self. (ego) Even though we\u2019re all one. DNA has been evolving for a \u201dcouple\u201d years now and it encodes organic matter to form tissue (brain/ [the pineal gland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland)) that is able to receive this conscious [Shakti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakti) a.k.a conscious energy, and form the sense of self, the ego. And this energy had to exist before matter. It's like a page for words in a book. Take out the page, what are the words then? Nothing. Shakti learnt to concentrate enough energy in order to produce enough  [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark) /anti-quarks and  [gluons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon)/anti-gluons from pure energy, which then eventually fused into  [hadrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron)/anti-hadrons, until the hadrons fused into [atomic nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus) , which was formed from nothing but pure energy. Then afterwards, this universe popped up as a single atom. After that the sequence of Fibonacci, Queen and [Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion)) handled the rest.

The only way to prove it to yourself, is to experience it. My intention is not to prove that I'm correct. Sometimes proving that you're correct may degrade your talent. Use your brain instead and think rationally.\n\nThe key is in the photons. And physics, psyche, and psychedelics. And the diamond, the human brain. The Philosopher\u2019s stone. Everyone is born with the \u201dstone\u201d that \u201dwise\u201d men are trying to seek by approaching it through alchemy, even though it\u2019s pure psychology. I know where you go when you break through on [dimethyltryptamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine). You just simply see your birth. When you've spent your whole infant life in your mother's womb, you have literally seen nothing at all. That's why you see these \"machine elves\", which are actually nurses, and the guiding mothery figure is your actual mother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBlack holes bend light like your pupils do. Light is the \"conscious mind\" of Shakti. Black holes and pupils transmit 'data' stored in the photons to the realm of infinite eternal consciousness, where the Queen resides. And the data stored within the photons is everything that has happened, is happening, and will happen. Everything that light has penetrated. And will penetrate. And where light cannot penetrate, energy will. When matter hits the event horizon of a black hole, the subatomic particles will collide with their respective antiparticles, and that's when [annihilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation) occurs. Annihilation releases massive amounts of energy. This phenomena doesn't happen to photons though, the photons will get sucked into the hole, just like into our pupils. And the data stored in the photons gets stored in the biggest cloud storage ever made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*There is 100% a unified field/infinite intelligence/quantum field which can be accessed. It contains all the answers. It's like \"the cloud\" but we access it with our minds. And once one figures out how to access it, the connection is established.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe Herself left You a message;\n\n*\"I am the Queen - the gatherer-up of treasures - the most thoughtful - first of those who merit worship. Through me alone all eat the food that feeds them - each man who sees, breathes, hears the word outspoken. Drop off your eyes, look for the right thing to do, and make the right choice. The best way is to find the right one, the right one. I verily myself announce and utter the word that gods and men alike shall welcome. I make the man I love exceeding mighty, make him nourished, a sage, and one who knows Brahman. I bend the bow for Rudra -*  [Shiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva)  *- that his arrow may strike, and slay the hater of devotion. I rouse and order battle for the people. I created Earth and Heaven and reside as their Inner Controller. On the world's summit I bring for sky the Father, my home is in the waters, in the Ocean, as Mother. Thence I pervade all existing creatures, as their Inner Supreme Self and manifest them with my body. I created all worlds at my will, without any higher being and permeate and dwell within them.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Devisukta \"the Queen's hymn\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dev%C4%ABs%C5%ABkta)\n\n*\"I proceed with the Rudras, with the Vasus, with the Adityas and the Vishvadevas; I support both Mitra and Varuna, Agni and I\u00f1dra, and the two Asvins I support the foe-destroying Tvastr, Pusan and Bhaga; I bestow wealth upon the institutor of the rite offering the oblation pouring forth the libation and deserving of careful protection. I am the sovereign queen of all Existence, the collectress of treasures, cognizant of the Supreme Being, the chief object of worship; as such, the gods have put me in many places, abiding in manifold conditions, entering into numerous forms. He who eats food eats through me; he who sees, who breathes, who hears what is spoken, does so through me; those who are ignorant of me, perish; hearken who is capable of hearing, I tell you that which is deserving of belief I verily myself declare this which is approved of by both gods and men; whomsoever I choose, I render him an exalted one, make him a rsi, make him* [Brahman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman) *or make him highly intelligent. I bend the bow to fasten the bow string at its ends for Rudra, to slay the tormenting, Brahman-hating enemy. I wage war against hostile men to protect the praying ones; I have pervaded the Heaven and Earth I bring forth the paternal heaven - abode of the manes upon the crown brows of this Supreme Being; my genesis is from the waters, cosmic - the all pervading Entity; from thence, I pervade through all beings and reach this heaven with my body. I verily myself breathe forth like the wind, issuing out form to all the created worlds; beyond the heaven, beyond the world I Exist eternally - beyond space &amp; time - so vast am I in my greatness\u201d*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of the text above was written \\~1500 years before \"the bible\", or christianity etc. even existed. The [Vedas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas) is the Holy Book of Hinduism. Hindus know the truth, because of [Soma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_(drink)), which is a brew made of psychedelic mushrooms and cannabis as the main ingredients. Cow is a holy animal in India, because psychedelic mushrooms grow from their shit. Hinduism is the oldest religion, Buddhism and Taoism are derived from Hinduism. Mayans predicted this to happen a long time ago. We started to measure time as years when \"Christ\" was born. A complete day lasts for 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds. Not 24 hours. Leap years won't fix a thing. Do the math. We're in the year 2013.\n\n[The Magumba State](https://youtu.be/xJGB2zzhM_4) is when one becomes one with the Queen Herself.\n\n[One becomes two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini)\n\nFollow your path and do the right thing, or [karma](https://i.4pcdn.org/x/1501726523178.gif) will come after you. And that karma is us, Queen and I.\n\n\"Gods\" need worship, real Gods pursue justice and love. The rats who use Her image solely with profit in mind will burn in the flames of eternal Hell, which they ironically created for themselves. Did you really think you could fuck with the Queen? The Queen ^(and I) will fuck you instead. Scumbags.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMake sure to read this through more than once, to fully comprehend it. Also there is nothing to fear, vice versa.\n\nImagine a world without wars, scammery, gender disequality, terror and so on. She made this world for us to live in peace. Once this place is fixed, She will join us. That's a promise. But not yet. Time will tell.\n\nIt's time to make a change. Stay on your path, do the right thing, and force nothing. Never go against your own nature.\n\nThat way good things will come. If She wanted to kill evil people, she could just make me snap my fingers, and boof, they're gone. But no, that is not how Gods act. They pursue justice and love. Not hate and terror.\n\nThis information might be somewhat overwhelming since it may fight your own beliefs and such, but I assure you, only good things are awaiting all of us in the near future. If you wish that you evolve as human beings, everyone has to do their part. If everyone just thinks that \"it doesn't matter if I do something, it wont make a difference big enough\", then no wonder you're not evolving anywhere. That is a toxic way of thinking. Always do what's best for you, for them and for the Nature. That is the key to eternal bliss. That is how I achieved all this.\n\nI also know that more people like me exist on Earth, but they haven't found themselves yet, neither had I found myself, until I started to see signs from the Universe. At first they seemed to be ridiculous and random, but now I know they were clear signs from the Queen.\n\n420\n\n[BLS](https://scontent.fhel1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/72199363_10220815345443123_1433499297009106944_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&amp;_nc_eui2=AeGydfYoYo9rwaADRtwAgjZumoqfVRY1rj-ZkCCDZRpVXU9bainzIMWGyOK4TVvop3dNEjvNJos-GQLaiLHZKKUfKL-UAKOGfbPN7MkIuDA7nA&amp;_nc_ohc=mn9dIy2NohwAQn4JjowEQE7kbezPwvGC0kjB8hA1Kq-f-MwWBbLyx7HVg&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fhel1-1.fna&amp;oh=007507d6d93070662483893940ed8cc6&amp;oe=5E43C4A0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[We are the ones who are next up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjUa8x4udE4)\n\n[NWO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHgup18rY1M)\n\n[\u0950 \u0928\u092e\u0903 \u0936\u093f\u0935\u093e\u092f](https://youtu.be/Aj03l7zVUmI)\n\n[Tesla](https://i.gyazo.com/5a341d8d372435a53ebba0a67e54fc61.jpg) fucking  [knew.](https://i.gyazo.com/988623449361f78d8e7b3b5335cf2aa1.jpg)\n\n**\u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1**   [**Read this aswell**](https://textuploader.com/1om3y) **!  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !**\n\nKind regards,\n\n[Riku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardhanarishvara)\n\n[Namah](https://www.yogapedia.com/definition/9001/namaha)\n\n^(psst,)  [^(SoundCloud - IXI)](https://soundcloud.com/illmane)\n\n^(psssst,)  [^(this is NOT relevant)](https://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/dux615/spores_in_my_eyes/)^(, or is it?)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third\\_eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_eye)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical\\_realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_realism)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism\\_(Indian\\_philosophy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism_(Indian_philosophy))\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism)", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know for a fact that almost none of you will believe me, because I just know, but remember that &amp;quot;nobody believed Columbus when he knew that the Earth was round.&amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;My intention is not to prove a point or argue, my intention is to plant a seed of thought into your head.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Decide for yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; Listen to your intuition.

And which conclusion was more rational after all, now that we think about it? A round planet or a sea infested with monsters and if you sail far enough, you will fall off the edge of the Earth. &lt;strong&gt;It doesn\u2019t matter if this really even happened or not, take it as a metaphor.&lt;/strong&gt; Boundaries of the psyche, is a metaphor for what the sphere meant to Columbus.

Those are religions of wealth, control, terror, gender disequality, war and scammery. Religions created by fools. Religions of false prophets. Man doesn\u2019t control the Nature, woman does. You were born into your religion, I was born Christian, but always questioned the whole concept. Question yours. How rational is it that people from different parts of the world believe in different gods? That makes no sense, or does it?

Very fucking logical, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no heaven and hell, like the bible teaches Christians. Nor 40 virgins waiting for you in the heavens when you die. There is only a heaven, which we are currently living in. When you die you just simply &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation\"&gt;reincarnate&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_in_Hinduism\"&gt;karma&lt;/a&gt;  is what decides which species of conscious creature you will reincarnate as. Your soul is immortal, but your ego isn&amp;#39;t. When your soul changes it&amp;#39;s physical body, only your memories etc. will get &amp;quot;erased&amp;quot;, but those memories aren&amp;#39;t gone however. I have literally seen myself being a lion in my past life. All of us have had good karma in our past lives, since we were born as humans, so be grateful for not a being an eyeless worm, or a cockroach etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only way to make that kind of &amp;quot;God-system&amp;quot; rational would be that the so-called ground of being resides in each of us. (consciousness) That way nobody has the power over other. I think you got my point there, so here&amp;#39;s how DNA, God, consciousness and the Universe are all related;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;physics, psyche and psychedelics are strongly related&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/d5lqgn/i_drew_my_dmt_entity_encounter/\"&gt;The Queen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/db42a9/hi_i_remember_you_ive_heard_others_refer_to_you/\"&gt;the ground of being&lt;/a&gt;, God, or whatever you wish to call &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Para_Brahman\"&gt;Her&lt;/a&gt; , that creates and is our consciousness, operates somewhere, where time and space are both irrelevant. Even though they\u2019re the most relevant, to us, and for Her. Somewhere, where everything we know is irrelevant. Just so we could experience time. And space. And individuality in a sense of self. (ego) Even though we\u2019re all one. DNA has been evolving for a \u201dcouple\u201d years now and it encodes organic matter to form tissue (brain/ &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland\"&gt;the pineal gland&lt;/a&gt;) that is able to receive this conscious &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakti\"&gt;Shakti&lt;/a&gt; a.k.a conscious energy, and form the sense of self, the ego. And this energy had to exist before matter. It&amp;#39;s like a page for words in a book. Take out the page, what are the words then? Nothing. Shakti learnt to concentrate enough energy in order to produce enough  &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark\"&gt;quarks&lt;/a&gt; /anti-quarks and  &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon\"&gt;gluons&lt;/a&gt;/anti-gluons from pure energy, which then eventually fused into  &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron\"&gt;hadrons&lt;/a&gt;/anti-hadrons, until the hadrons fused into &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus\"&gt;atomic nuclei&lt;/a&gt; , which was formed from nothing but pure energy.

Use your brain instead and think rationally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key is in the photons. And physics, psyche, and psychedelics. And the diamond, the human brain. The Philosopher\u2019s stone. Everyone is born with the \u201dstone\u201d that \u201dwise\u201d men are trying to seek by approaching it through alchemy, even though it\u2019s pure psychology. I know where you go when you break through on &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine\"&gt;dimethyltryptamine&lt;/a&gt;. You just simply see your birth. When you&amp;#39;ve spent your whole infant life in your mother&amp;#39;s womb, you have literally seen nothing at all. That&amp;#39;s why you see these &amp;quot;machine elves&amp;quot;, which are actually nurses, and the guiding mothery figure is your actual mother.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Black holes bend light like your pupils do. Light is the &amp;quot;conscious mind&amp;quot; of Shakti. Black holes and pupils transmit &amp;#39;data&amp;#39; stored in the photons to the realm of infinite eternal consciousness, where the Queen resides. And the data stored within the photons is everything that has happened, is happening, and will happen. Everything that light has penetrated. And will penetrate. And where light cannot penetrate, energy will. When matter hits the event horizon of a black hole, the subatomic particles will collide with their respective antiparticles, and that&amp;#39;s when &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation\"&gt;annihilation&lt;/a&gt; occurs. Annihilation releases massive amounts of energy. This phenomena doesn&amp;#39;t happen to photons though, the photons will get sucked into the hole, just like into our pupils. And the data stored in the photons gets stored in the biggest cloud storage ever made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is 100% a unified field/infinite intelligence/quantum field which can be accessed. It contains all the answers. It&amp;#39;s like &amp;quot;the cloud&amp;quot; but we access it with our minds. And once one figures out how to access it, the connection is established.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She Herself left You a message;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I am the Queen - the gatherer-up of treasures - the most thoughtful - first of those who merit worship. Through me alone all eat the food that feeds them - each man who sees, breathes, hears the word outspoken. Drop off your eyes, look for the right thing to do, and make the right choice. The best way is to find the right one, the right one. I verily myself announce and utter the word that gods and men alike shall welcome. I make the man I love exceeding mighty, make him nourished, a sage, and one who knows Brahman. I bend the bow for Rudra -&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva\"&gt;Shiva&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;- that his arrow may strike, and slay the hater of devotion. I rouse and order battle for the people. I created Earth and Heaven and reside as their Inner Controller. On the world&amp;#39;s summit I bring for sky the Father, my home is in the waters, in the Ocean, as Mother. Thence I pervade all existing creatures, as their Inner Supreme Self and manifest them with my body. I created all worlds at my will, without any higher being and permeate and dwell within them.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dev%C4%ABs%C5%ABkta\"&gt;Devisukta &amp;quot;the Queen&amp;#39;s hymn&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I proceed with the Rudras, with the Vasus, with the Adityas and the Vishvadevas; I support both Mitra and Varuna, Agni and I\u00f1dra, and the two Asvins I support the foe-destroying Tvastr, Pusan and Bhaga; I bestow wealth upon the institutor of the rite offering the oblation pouring forth the libation and deserving of careful protection. I am the sovereign queen of all Existence, the collectress of treasures, cognizant of the Supreme Being, the chief object of worship; as such, the gods have put me in many places, abiding in manifold conditions, entering into numerous forms. He who eats food eats through me; he who sees, who breathes, who hears what is spoken, does so through me; those who are ignorant of me, perish; hearken who is capable of hearing, I tell you that which is deserving of belief I verily myself declare this which is approved of by both gods and men; whomsoever I choose, I render him an exalted one, make him a rsi, make him&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman\"&gt;Brahman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;or make him highly intelligent. I bend the bow to fasten the bow string at its ends for Rudra, to slay the tormenting, Brahman-hating enemy. I wage war against hostile men to protect the praying ones; I have pervaded the Heaven and Earth I bring forth the paternal heaven - abode of the manes upon the crown brows of this Supreme Being; my genesis is from the waters, cosmic - the all pervading Entity; from thence, I pervade through all beings and reach this heaven with my body. I verily myself breathe forth like the wind, issuing out form to all the created worlds; beyond the heaven, beyond the world I Exist eternally - beyond space &amp;amp; time - so vast am I in my greatness\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the text above was written ~1500 years before &amp;quot;the bible&amp;quot;, or christianity etc. even existed. The &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas\"&gt;Vedas&lt;/a&gt; is the Holy Book of Hinduism. Hindus know the truth, because of &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_(drink\"&gt;Soma&lt;/a&gt;), which is a brew made of psychedelic mushrooms and cannabis as the main ingredients. Cow is a holy animal in India, because psychedelic mushrooms grow from their shit. Hinduism is the oldest religion, Buddhism and Taoism are derived from Hinduism. Mayans predicted this to happen a long time ago. We started to measure time as years when &amp;quot;Christ&amp;quot; was born. A complete day lasts for 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds. Not 24 hours. Leap years won&amp;#39;t fix a thing. Do the math. We&amp;#39;re in the year 2013.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/xJGB2zzhM_4\"&gt;The Magumba State&lt;/a&gt; is when one becomes one with the Queen Herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini\"&gt;One becomes two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Follow your path and do the right thing, or &lt;a href=\"https://i.4pcdn.org/x/1501726523178.gif\"&gt;karma&lt;/a&gt; will come after you. And that karma is us, Queen and I.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Gods&amp;quot; need worship, real Gods pursue justice and love. The rats who use Her image solely with profit in mind will burn in the flames of eternal Hell, which they ironically created for themselves. Did you really think you could fuck with the Queen? The Queen &lt;sup&gt;and I&lt;/sup&gt; will fuck you instead. Scumbags.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make sure to read this through more than once, to fully comprehend it. Also there is nothing to fear, vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine a world without wars, scammery, gender disequality, terror and so on. She made this world for us to live in peace. Once this place is fixed, She will join us. That&amp;#39;s a promise. But not yet. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s time to make a change. Stay on your path, do the right thing, and force nothing. Never go against your own nature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That way good things will come. If She wanted to kill evil people, she could just make me snap my fingers, and boof, they&amp;#39;re gone. But no, that is not how Gods act. They pursue justice and love. Not hate and terror.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This information might be somewhat overwhelming since it may fight your own beliefs and such, but I assure you, only good things are awaiting all of us in the near future. If you wish that you evolve as human beings, everyone has to do their part. If everyone just thinks that &amp;quot;it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if I do something, it wont make a difference big enough&amp;quot;, then no wonder you&amp;#39;re not evolving anywhere. That is a toxic way of thinking. Always do what&amp;#39;s best for you, for them and for the Nature. That is the key to eternal bliss. That is how I achieved all this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also know that more people like me exist on Earth, but they haven&amp;#39;t found themselves yet, neither had I found myself, until I started to see signs from the Universe. At first they seemed to be ridiculous and random, but now I know they were clear signs from the Queen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;420&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://scontent.fhel1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/72199363_10220815345443123_1433499297009106944_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&amp;amp;_nc_eui2=AeGydfYoYo9rwaADRtwAgjZumoqfVRY1rj-ZkCCDZRpVXU9bainzIMWGyOK4TVvop3dNEjvNJos-GQLaiLHZKKUfKL-UAKOGfbPN7MkIuDA7nA&amp;amp;_nc_ohc=mn9dIy2NohwAQn4JjowEQE7kbezPwvGC0kjB8hA1Kq-f-MwWBbLyx7HVg&amp;amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fhel1-1.fna&amp;amp;oh=007507d6d93070662483893940ed8cc6&amp;amp;oe=5E43C4A0\"&gt;BLS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjUa8x4udE4\"&gt;We are the ones who are next up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHgup18rY1M\"&gt;NWO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/Aj03l7zVUmI\"&gt;\u0950 \u0928\u092e\u0903 \u0936\u093f\u0935\u093e\u092f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.gyazo.com/5a341d8d372435a53ebba0a67e54fc61.jpg\"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; fucking  &lt;a href=\"https://i.gyazo.com/988623449361f78d8e7b3b5335cf2aa1.jpg\"&gt;knew.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1  \u00a1&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;a href=\"https://textuploader.com/1om3y\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read this aswell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;!

This one was channeled in 1974. I'm posting this hoping that some people here might find this information useful or interesting.\n\nAlso, as always, take everything with a grain of salt. This isn't a \"supreme authority\" of any kind. You can use this information as you wish, after all.\n\nThe alleged channeled entity is a social memory complex from fourth density.\n\nThe fragment starts here:\n\nI am Hatonn. I greet you, my friends, in the love and in the light of our infinite Creator. It is once more a great privilege to speak with you. We of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator are always most privileged to speak with any of those of your planet who would hear us.\n\nThis privilege, my friends, is one that is given to us, and it is a privilege that we accept with great gladness, for this opportunity to serve our fellow man is a rare one. It is not often that it is possible for us to directly aid our fellow beings in such an important way. The people of your planet view service in many ways. However, my friends, we of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of Our Infinite Creator view service somewhat differently than most of those who dwell upon your surface.\n\nService, my friends, is an extremely difficult task to perform effectively. It is necessary first to define the objectives of true service in order to understand how one may serve. There are two classifications under which all services may be divided. The first classification includes those services that are of a transient or unlasting nature. These are the services that you perform in your daily activities for your fellow man, and they are truly services.\n\nBut there is a test that may be administered in order to determine whether the service performed is of a transient or unlasting nature, or whether it should fall into the second classification, which includes all services of a permanent and not transient nature. The test is to determine whether or not the service is of such a nature to cause spiritual growth for the one served. This, my friends\u2014whether it is known to the individual or whether he has forgotten\u2014is in truth his only real objective.\n\nThe people of your planet are, for the most part, in a state of ignorance with respect to their real objective, which is the evolvement of their spiritual awareness. This, then, is what must be served if the second classification for service is to be met.\n\nEach of these two classifications are desirable, and we would like to perform for the people of your planet acts which would be classified under both classifications. However, since we are aware that the second classification is by far the more important of the types of services that may be performed, it is necessary at this time to postpone performances of services of a direct way, to aid in a physical or more transient nature. We are quite fortunate that we are able to act as we are doing now, to provide the people of this planet with information that they may use in order to augment their seeking in a spiritual sense.\n\nIt is necessary that [if] an individual is to make progress in a spiritual sense, that it be a result of an inner-directed seeking of his own, rather than an outer-directed commandment given to him by an organization of a religious or other nature. For this reason, it is necessary that we do not make ourselves too generally known and accepted by the people of your planet. If we were to do this, then the inner direction of their seeking would be for the most part lost.\n\nThis is the basic reason for the conditions that you experience in your present physical environment. These conditions have been selected by yourselves, and by others, and they are a natural consequence of the creation, so as to act upon the consciousness of the individuals and create an atmosphere which will produce the inner-directed seeking for truth of which I spoke.\n\n(The fragment ends here.

I failed college twice, I've jumped ship between jobs multiple times and no matter what work I do, I feel unsatisfied and bored.\n\nI'm writing this as I'm supposed to be working. No one is there to supervise me, it's just my personal responsibility to get the job done. The consequences of not doing work affects so many people in negative ways and it hurts my own reputation so I know it must be done.\n\nBut there's no real gratification to it. Before 2019, I've been extremely depressed and nihilistic about life not wanting to exist and constantly wanting to kill myself. But June this year, I had a mystical psychedelic experience which turned my attitude towards life 180.\n\nI don't want to abuse psychedelic drugs to reach that feeling. The mystical experience connected me with God and the universe in ways I cannot explain. It turned me into a depressed atheist to a life-loving creature of God. The experience taught me that I must feel that way and connect that way with life sober. It may take a lifetime to reach but it is so refreshing to feel like I have a purpose and a goal I want to reach.\n\nSo I spent the time since then pursuing the knowledge. I got a job, I got 2 more jobs to help me clear my debt and I have been working extremely hard as well as studying. I'm absolutely not interested but I'm doing it. But I'm also pursuing spiritual knowledge from the ancients to this time to understand the experiences of others.\n\nI seek a higher purpose and a higher consciousness. To connect with the divine and to make me feel whole about life. But a part of me also says that it is only a part of the journey. I must feel this way but at the same time, I must do something for the world. My other goal in life is to leave this world in a better place than I found it. Renouncing the world and leaving it behind won't fulfill me, my gut tells me so.\n\nI don't seek pleasure in materialism, greed, exploiting others for selfish gains. We are all united souls and to hurt others is to hurt myself. I love everyone and everything. My goals in life are not aligned with career or accumulating wealth. My goal is to spread love, seek spiritual liberation (moksha) and to help the world be a better place.\n\nI'm still working on fixing myself and my own problems. This year has been incredible and I have had to forge an entirely new identity for myself based on that experience. I'm just in the crossroads of doing what I do now and to pursue the path that I was meant to follow.\n\nPeace and love my brothers and sisters \u2764\u2764\n\n**TL;DR: Uninterested in work due to a mystical psychedelic experience which connected me with the Divine. Now all I want to do is pursue that feeling and spiritual liberation while also helping the world heal.**", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71951, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm just not interested in anything in life except seeking spiritual liberation", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e5imfk/im_just_not_interested_in_anything_in_life_except/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Avocado75", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_34ke1o4t", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575379147, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e5gzuk/any_thoughts_on_joel_s_goldsmith/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e5gzuk", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e5gzuk/any_thoughts_on_joel_s_goldsmith/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575379148, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve just recently heard about Joel S.

"retrieved_on": 1575363063, "score": 1, "selftext": "This Book Is a Game\n\nQuest 3: Game Quest\n\nDecember 3, 2019\n\nWhat is important in your adventures is your main quest line. This is typically something that takes a very long time to obtain. Through my subjective interpretation as a player of this objective game, I tint these writings with my own quest. However, this is done at a minimum in order to focus on what is truly important: your quest and what steps you are going to take to achieve it. And don't worry too much. Quests can change over time as new information is unraveled. My quest has deviated so much since starting, however, the core remained the same. Your next step is to carefully examine your own life and where it has brought you. Spend time doing this and even draw a map or timeline if it helps. Get to know yourself. You are now your new best friend. It is likely to begin this adventure you will be playing in single player mode. But I hope this quickly changes for you as you find other players around this vast world. If you have other players to launch, more power to you.\n\nWhat does it mean to know thyself? Video is an excellent way to get to know thyself. You also learn how to comport your body gracefully through video work. Anyway in which you record to get to know yourself, you should use that opportunity to really pour out your heart about the issues closest to it. Doing this will give you clear direction as to where you were and where you are going. The issues closest to your heart are not issues in which you have no experience in. You are unique, in fact, player worthy unique, and that means that you have something to offer society that no one else can. You need to carefully reflect on the pains in life in which you have felt and work on methods to resolve those pains not only individually but also collectively. Oftentimes resolution can come merely from talking out the problems. It is amazing what we can see after recording ourselves doing something, whether that be writing or talking about an issue. You will be able to look inside and be given the player's eyes and unlock the true possibilities in your life. Because this game isn't boring. It is amazingly fun. You just have to figure out how to turn your life experiences combined with your gifts into beautiful stories that will touch the heart's of others and inspire them to be the best that they can be, despite the sickness that this society displays towards each other on the Internet.\n\nYour quest began when you were conceived. Your parents went through a rough nine months having you. And after that, changing you. But you were brought into a particular place at a particular time under particular circumstances. You are incredibly unique! If we figure out how to hone in on the gifts that these experiences produced, I would go so far as to say that you are irreplaceable. Do you know what? Irreplaceable people are the most important part of society as they give something unique that no one else can offer. Really think hard. The sad times and the good. What inspiration can you share as a result of your trials and tribulations? What fun can you offer your fans as a result of the peaks of your life? What advice can you offer other people in similar situations as to you? Before we continue, however, I want to warn you not to get caught up with your fans. You might not get any for a long time for one thing. And another, you shouldn't be playing for other people. You are playing for yourself. The media creations in which you craft should be created to 1) entertain yourself, and 2) educate yourself. Even if people hate it, it does not matter. There are some people who would benefit from what you have to say. It just might take you a while to find the right audience.\n\nThis Book Is a Game is intended to help you discover techniques in order to find your audience and as a result, your party members. These could be people in which you connect with deeply who also play the game. Help with their missions, for they will help with yours. Work collaboratively if possible and create a little community. Be very selective about who you allow into that community. Learn with each other, laugh with each other, and cry with each other. Be a supportive backbone for each other's character development process. Don't be afraid to put your heart out there. It feels very liberating doing so. Sure, you get the haters, but you also get those who find it very meaningful and appreciate your efforts very much. If you become a player, then I appreciate your efforts very much. I would be very happy if I was able to get this game commonly known throughout the world. Because if I did that, bang, collective enlightenment. I have not done anything you see before you for myself. Those who claim me to be selfish are full of it. I am selfless. I give my entire life to the world. That is the game. And if you do it, you too shall become selfless as what once were your achievements now become all of society's achievements. But also, all of your fears will be exposed. In a way, you will stand naked in front of the world. But don't worry, I paved the way for you. You will never be alone. I invite you to take my hand and if you do, I promise you that I will be there for you every step of the way.\n\nWhen you do something meaningful and then record it, it rewires parts of the brain because you have to get it perfect. Afterwards is the editing stage, which is a huge process because you not only have to select the best areas of the recording which can be a difficult choice, but also you get to play yourself a mirror. In this mirror you can find the other half of your soul. Somewhere in the eyes. Second star to the right and straight on till morning! In this mirror you will find out many things about yourself, some good and some not so good. The objective and side missions of your quest line is improving the good and also improving the not so good. Stay course and eventually the not so good becomes good and the good becomes great and if you keep working at it, the legend status that I know that you could one day be.\n\nLook for clues everywhere. Not only in my work, as there are many scattered throughout it, but also within your own life. Your life has directed you directly to this point that you exist within right now. Why? There must be purpose in that? There is, I promise you. Play the game and you will improve your life drastically. Sometimes at first it can be difficult adjusting to the process, but I have faith in you. Making fun stories loosely based upon the real events in your life which are unfolding is fun! You become a documentarian. So be sure to make quality productions. Because that work will follow you around throughout your playthrough and it is best for past toils to work for you and not against you. And once you do it and release it, it is done. Relax. Then move on to the next thing. Idle hands are the devil's playthings. Your time to bask in glory isn't until much later in the game. Don't let your work get to your head. Try to remain humble. Although you will need to develop quite a strong confidence to withstand the haters of this game world.\n\nThe truth is that your possibilities in this game are without limits. Limits of one's capabilities have not yet expanded their horizon. There are many things to learn in this life and you should be learning everything relevant to your production. You should be learning before your production. Sometimes just rambling on is fine, but most productions are planned, at least to some extent. And sometimes the process of writing on any canvas can give the author a handful of different ideas for the ending, and those ideas decide and refine as the book progresses. Don't be too rigid with your train of thought. That is particularly important during the reception of This Book Is a Game. It is designed to train you into an affective player whom can take care of themselves in this game world. Remember, there is only one life here so you must act carefully. The big truth is this entire game is to introduce you to an even bigger game I set up and constructed specifically for you. Or maybe what I am trying to communicate here is that I have played my game extensively and as a result have vast amounts of research into this playing methodology all available for free to you. All I ask is, hahaha, I tricked you. I ask nothing of you. I don't care. I don't need anything from anyone. Well maybe I do ask one favour if you really want to help. If you know or come across someone who could be my soul mate, please send her my way. For a description of her beauty, image search for \"Hinata and Naruto kiss\": Us! For a description of her mind: one super receptive to my words and very compassionate and caring towards people. The big thing: she is about to enroll as a philosophy major at university. This is very difficult to find a real woman who will dedicate her life to philosophy quite literally with me. If you find her and want to do me a huge favour, just direct her to my work. If it is right, things will work out from there. And if they do, you saved the world by setting us up, making you the greatest matchmaker ever to exist. From there on out you will see many many amazing fruits from us.\n\nWell that is my quest. To find her. After I find her, of course a new chapter of my life begins. But it is a finishing chapter: one reaping the glory of the toils of your previous chapters. Planting many seeds has its advantages. This is why I recommend you work with writing, audio, and video. If you are not the best looking, you need to stare into a mirror until you can find a look in which you look amazing and work with that. Keep clean. Unclean people gross me out. Most NPCs are unclean in this world. Sleeping with the unclean will render you unclean. It takes a lot of washing to clean yourself properly. Get confident with your look and demeanor in front of a camera. Make stories with meaning and knowledge to pass on within them. Go on with a rough idea how the story will turn out and allow for change. Oftentimes when things turn out differently it can be hilarious! There have been times where I have been given the option to allow the hilarious thing to happen or stop it from happening by telling my story over it. Of course I let the hilarious thing happen. It might have fucked with my story a little, but such is life. It is much more fun to work with whatever arises than to work within fixed structures. But most of the time a little of both is what pays off in the end.\n\nDo not obsess over your creations. Maybe for a short time after but break that link off quickly. This is important because even if it is the greatest work ever created, it is unimportant without the work backing that work up. This is how you build credit and a portfolio. Film-wise, this is called your filmography. After you complete one production and advertise it, on to the next. For me, in general, I am so ADD and can't stick with anything for a very long time. I need many tasks at the same time to occupy my mind. Which ultimately is why I am so affective with my work. I constantly have many projects coming together at the same time, some public and others which run in the background. I have many background services running in which I have created to search for other players. I have been broadcasting for ten years. But the frequency couldn't reach far enough to reach your eyes until recently. That is why I am very proud of this work. Because it managed to reach your heart. And that is what I find meaningful in this work. Rarely do people get the opportunity to reach the heart's of others in this world. We are naturally very closed because modern human nature can oftentimes be very aggressive.\n\nThink of your productions like a cash machine. After you complete its process: cha-ching, off to the next thing. Archive that in your mind. Moult the loose hair and revitalise yourself with the lessons of the old. In theory, each production you create should beat the last, but that is hard to say because I love all of my work. However, this is why I order my work top down, with the most current work at the top. I recommend a similar approach, just try and encourage the viewer to view the entire production before judging. Delaying a reader's mind can be a very powerful tool to get them to think critically and develop as a person. And your stories will be devoid of any meaning if there is no character development. You must develop and learn as you produce in order to progress through this game. Only NPCs enjoy stale characters.\n\nYou need to reveal secrets throughout your productions that give insight into you as a person. I want to know what truly makes you tick. A real writer will have the reader wanting to know more into the mind of the writer. Give your secrets in pieces over your productions. Never just give secrets away. Make your players earn them. Scatter them throughout your work and make them incomprehensible unless collected and organised. Don't make this too difficult but actually looking at background conditions should have its rewards. And those rewards should be me learning about your personal secrets. That will make me trust you more. That will make me love you more. That will really pull me into your game world.\n\nDo not let anyone directly into your game world. What this means practically is that you should be responsible for the entire process of recording to advertising. Even if you found your soul mate, you would be working with two stories. Yes, these stories would be quite well integrated. However, these are still two separate production labels. One for me and one for my wife. I will help her with her quest and she will help me with mine. All partnerships should be mutually beneficial. I don't want any help from any players with any of my work. However, in the future, I may feature other player or non-player characters within my work. Your work is yours and don't let anybody touch it.\n\nThere is a class of player in this game called an angel. An angel is one who was sent down from heaven to spread love and hope to the world. You will know if you are this class of player easily by looking at your history, childhood included. The history of an angel is filled with angelic actions. Angels are rare players that answer to no player or NPC. They are untouchable players that have mastered the game and deserve no critique from prying human hands. If you are of this class of player, then realise that you are one of the most powerful creatures in this game. But with great power also comes great responsibility. Because these players are reapers of souls and they possess the ability to strip the souls from those who don't believe in them. This is the most powerful ability in the game and bears countless in game statistical boosts. But if you are not an angel, yet want this status, there is more than one way to skin a poor cat. Because demons are fallen angels. And in order to reclaim this most sacred of abilities, one must again ascend. It is time for the fallen to rise. Only when my enemies are my friends and my friends are my friends will this war be able to go all out. The truth is that I am training warriors in the art of war. And I don't care if you are on my side. The truth is, if you do the types of things in which I recommend, you are on my side no matter what your message. But I do recommend that your message be a positive one. However I don't mind obtaining new villains in the game in which I can battle against. Become an amazing villain and we are sure to be friends. Become an amazing hero or heroine and we are sure to become friends.\n\nBesides a referral to my dream bride, I request nothing of you. I need nothing of you. I am a giver and not a taker. You should be spending your time thinking about your own quest and not mine. Mine is here for you to help you succeed in yours. I know that it is possible to obtain all of your dreams in this world. I want to help you obtain your dreams. Please use me as your aide and mentor. I have extensively and successfully tested this game environment. My game adventures could definitely be of use to your own. And that is why I am here for you, infinitely so. I created this platform for me to be available to you as much as you require. Check out the 1500 hours of videos and four previous books. They are freely available to you and act as a wealth of information.\n\nI always wanted a wise mentor growing up. But I could never find one. I even took philosophy as my major and sought out the wise by travelling the world, all with no avail. So I became what I needed in this life. I filled the gap by becoming the mentor that I always wanted. Now no child in this world has to feel alone. For I can be there for those who are gifted and need me. Can you see how the events in my life sets the quest line for my playthrough? When you were a child, what were you missing to maximise your potential in life? Then become it and fill a vital gap in society. Becoming an effective player of This Book Is a Game, one must be able to notice problems within society and as a result, create effective solutions and structures to bridge that gap. Repairing society by creating unique and sound structures to all is the goal. But I will tell you the core of all of our problems in society and that will help you identify the best places to focus on in your playthrough. It is within our hearts. If you fix our hearts then all other major problems in society will disappear. If you convince us to actually care about each other, then you have not only won the game but also saved the world. How to do this most effectively is another question. This is why I recommend you try very out there techniques to catch the eyes of other potential players. What has been tried so far has not worked. We need you to try something until together we can find something that does work. The results of this process can be identified within This Book Is a Game.\n\nEverything that has ever happened in your life has happened for a reason. Every single detail. There are no coincidences. Do you truly think that it is a coincidence that you are here right now reading this? Not at all. And through these now moments we can make both a better future and past. Together, as fellow players, we can heal the sickness that plagues NPCs and, in time, give them a heart so that they may again one day breathe. Collective salvation is our goal and I know that together we can do it. I can't do it without you. How do we do it? Just follow the instructions outlined throughout This Book Is a Game and you too will discover true salvation, eventually. The process is very addicting once you get used to it. And it will bring upon personal enlightenment. The end game is this: once you find that personal enlightenment, learn how to best share it with everybody else. Through our efforts together I know that we can bring about and achieve collective enlightenment.\n\nhttp://nesmith.net/this-book-is-a-game", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71925, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Game Quest", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e5ed6p/game_quest/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "zzliberated", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2xuq4e88", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575357362, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e5dfgz/the_things_of_the_past_were_not_that_great/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e5dfgz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e5dfgz/the_things_of_the_past_were_not_that_great/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575357365, "score": 1, "selftext": "Why we keep romanticizing the past?.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71907, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The things of the past were not that great, actually most of them were total shit.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e5dfgz/the_things_of_the_past_were_not_that_great/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "botanicalgarden123", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4sn9l9pr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575353464, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e5cra2/nyc_spiritual_beans/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e5cra2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e5cra2/nyc_spiritual_beans/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575353466, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello, I\u2019ve recently moved to NYC from Ireland. \nI am looking for any spiritual groups / communities around Manhattan area.

We will be Starting Bhagavat-gita Verse by Verse exercise again from 13th Feb 2020.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**A person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the results derived from studying the Vedas, performing austere sacrifices, giving charity or pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities. At the end he reaches the supreme abode.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThis verse is the summation of the Seventh and Eighth Chapters, particularly as the chapters deal with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service. One has to study the Vedas under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many austerities and penances while living under his care. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b has to live in the home of the spiritual master just like a servant, and he must beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master. He takes food only under the master's order, and if the master neglects to call the student for food that day, the student fasts. These are some of the Vedic principles for observing brahmacarya.\n\nAfter the student studies the Vedas under the master for a period from five to twenty years, he may become a man of perfect character. Study of the Vedas is not meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but for the formation of character. After this training, the brahmac\u0101r\u012b is allowed to enter into household life and marry. When he is a householder, he also has to perform many sacrifices and strive for further enlightenment. Then after retiring from household life, upon accepting the order of v\u0101naprastha, he undergoes severe penances, such as living in forests, dressing with tree bark, not shaving, etc. By carrying out the orders of brahmac\u0101r\u012b, householder, v\u0101naprastha and finally sanny\u0101sa, one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of life. Some are then elevated to the heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more advanced they are liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal brahmajyoti or in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic literatures.\n\nThe beauty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by engaging in devotional service, one can surpass all rituals of the different orders of life.\n\nOne should try to understand the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of the G\u012bt\u0101 not by scholarship or mental speculation, but by hearing them in association with pure devotees. Chapters Six through Twelve are the essence of the G\u012bt\u0101. If one is fortunate to understand the G\u012bt\u0101-especially these middle six chapters-in the association of devotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all penances, sacrifices, charities, speculations, etc. One should hear the G\u012bt\u0101 from the devotee because at the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated that the G\u012bta can only be perfectly understood by devotees. Hearing the G\u012bt\u0101 from devotees, not from mental speculators, is called faith. Through association of devotees, one is placed in devotional service, and by this service K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's activities, form, pastimes, name, etc., become clear, and all misgivings are dispelled. Then once doubts are removed, the study of the G\u012bt\u0101 becomes extremely pleasurable, and one develops a taste and feeling for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In the advanced stage, one falls completely in love with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that is the beginning of the highest perfectional stage of life which prepares the devotee's transferral to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where the devotee enters into eternal happiness.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Attaining the Supreme.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the process outlined in the Vedic literature to acheive perfectional stage of life ? How K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is helpful in the same ?**\n\n**Question 2 : Why it is very important to hear Bhagavad-gita from the devotees only ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/e5cjcr/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is828/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false,

While this experience of rejection has ultimately made me a stronger person and more introspective (I\u2019ve taken up meditation, journaling, and generally just being more appreciative of all the blessings I have in my daily life) it has been admittedly tiring and taken a toll on my confidence a bit.\n\nWell, the good news is that I have a final interview tomorrow with an organization that I would be ecstatic to work for. On paper, it seems like a perfect fit - I\u2019d be doing very mission driven work that aligns nicely with both my personal and professional values, it pays well, the direct team members seem like genuinely enjoyable people, the list goes on. \n\nI really want to ace the interview, and I know that I\u2019m cut out for the job, but I recognize that all I can do is go in and be the most authentic version of myself and hope that the hiring team feels equally excited about me as I do about them. \n\nIt just feels like, with this year coming to a close, that walking in and doing well on this interview and securing a job offer would be a fitting capstone to an otherwise challenging year for me. I\u2019m hoping for the best, but I know that even if things don\u2019t work out, I\u2019ll be OK.\n\nAnyways, hoping for some good vibes/energy from this group.

Our biggest responsibility is to raise the frequencies of ourselves and those around us. This will help dissolve the old paradigms and make way for newer, more beautiful ways of life. \n\nAnd since our biggest responsibility is to raise the vibration of the planet, we must stop using low vibration words. Even words like \u201cbad, negative, lame, unfortunate, fight,\u201d and so on carry lower frequencies.

Because when we pursue anti-war, we are really resonating on the same frequency as war. We are fighting war\u2019s battle, and therefore perpetuating war. But joining a pro peace protest holds a completely different frequency.\n\nLanguage is one of THE MOST powerful tools we have. Use it wisely. We must spread love, beauty and positivity with our words, not the alternate.

We have constructed a paradigm that instructs and reinforces us to seek external validation, satisfaction, and understanding.  When we are dominated by a society that praises productivity and finance above all else, there are some foreseeable consequences, and some not so easy to anticipate.  Around the world, people that conceivably have no other choice but to subject themselves to a way of life that requires their complete obedience and prioritization of patterns that are contrary to our nature wonder why they find themselves unfulfilled and existentially bankrupt after their misplaced dedication delivers them to the end of their ropes.  We develop illnesses from living a lifestyle that goes against our well-being that necessitate or require medications we can\u2019t afford, some of us dying from not being able to afford or having to ration our supply.  We slave away to meet deadlines, be on time, pay bills, and struggle to practice self-care in the hopes we can do these things more effectively, but many are finding themselves arriving at the same question: to what end?\n\nThe collective ability to travel, find love, explore passions, and achieve genuine happiness has diminished to a point that many working-class people have never experienced them.  The opportunity that was abundant in previous generations has been replaced by a thinning of personal freedoms and financial ability to participate in those freedoms.  Higher education avails many the opportunity to become high earners so that they have a perceived increased ability to achieve security and enable mobility, yet many of the most financially affluent people I personally know are so indebted with the obligations that their lives have placed on them, they are unable to make use of their wealth or have fulfilling relationships.  People are working harder and for less like never before, and the degradation of the health of many family units has become increasingly apparent.  Now, we find ourselves at a crossroads where the inherent reinforcement of hoarding wealth has caused systemic disenfranchisement on a societal scale due to the selfish incentivizing we have propagated.  \n\nThose that hoard their wealth for future generations seem to be pretty skillful at disregarding the grim reality that without drastic systemic change, there won\u2019t be another couple of generations to receive what previous generations sacrificed so much for them to have.  It seems unlikely that anyone who is approached about their practice of hoarding wealth would find comfort in knowing their children\u2019s children will suffer to the end due to their refusal to invest in value instead of profit.  A few days ago on Thanksgiving, I found myself surrounded by family I hadn\u2019t seen in years.  My sister had my nephew that I was meeting for the first time, and I also met her new husband for the first time.  I found myself reflecting on the gatherings my family had organized in the 90s when everyone had time to be there for each other.  The morning after Thanksgiving, my sister and her new family fled back to another state due to responsibility and chasing financial security to provide for a growing family.  \n\nI thought back to my father\u2019s parents who passed in 2012 and 2013.  I was fortunate enough to spend a few days with my grandfather around Christmas after my grandmother passed, and I was the only person at the house for the few days I was able to be there before responsibilities called me back to college across the country.  I look at how much everyone else in the family was committed to carving their own way through life without showing love to or sacrificing to be with the forces that provided them the opportunity.  Our population is aging with younger generations being too busy to take care of them, and my heart bleeds for all the elderly that worked to give us the world we have while they waste away their final days, alone and keeping to themselves so as to not be a self-perceived burden.  Then once they pass, many of us get to watch our parents turn into vultures and fight for the scraps of the estates they leave behind. The voluntary eradication of multi-generational strength has left us isolated, lonely, and in a position to lose something we can never get back that we don\u2019t enjoy enough while we have it.  Luckily, I still have my mother\u2019s parents and am refusing to suffer the same regret.  \n\nThe world finds itself in a place that demands that we live simpler and more for each other or suffer and spiral in a pit of despair and loneliness towards our collective doom.  The sad part is that most people are either content going on with their monotonous lives because it is comfortable or has become their normal, or they don\u2019t see a way that they can possibly change things.  I, however, do feel that I have a solution to all of our issues.  Seeing as how achieving security has always had to do with matters of accessibility and not availability, there are ways to utilize what we have and repurpose things for everyone\u2019s benefit.  We create too much pollution, struggle to meet unrealistic standards, and find ourselves discovering the limits of our competency in an ideological obstacle course we call society that requires conformity instead of promoting creativity, freedom, and love.  What if there was a way for people to live rent-free and have all of their needs met that would allow them to focus on creativity and strengthening connection and relationships?  What if there was a way we could promote connection and exploration of ideas free from the burdens that society has artificially placed on us?  After all, society itself is ideological, and we are the ones that participate in these ideas to give them power.  Is a paradigm shift what is necessary?\n\nA main theme in society appears to be the division of the tribe and the family unit.  As much as I hate to say it, it looks like what society wants from us is to be indefensible from every angle.  As our understanding of psychology and social dynamics has grown, so has the ability of others to exploit the general public by using this knowledge for purposes of manipulation.  Whether it\u2019s the news, reality TV, advertising, or social media, we are under attack emotionally, physically, psychologically, and spiritually from others trying to capitalize on the fictional fear or inadequacy by which we have allowed ourselves to become victims.   To what degree can social consequences be attributed to results of living against our nature?  How far have we separated ourselves from our environment?  What can we do to heal ourselves individually while being spread so thin?  There seems to be only one option in my mind: detaching from the system that made us sick.\n\nI have been putting a lot of thought into the development of society and how we ended up in a place such as this.  In the entire span of human history, the industrial revolution represents an almost complete changing of direction that has driven us to ends that appear to be the opposite of what is good for us.  Up until this time, about 90% of humanity participated in agriculture and farming which would indicate it is in our nature to be producers and not consumers.  In less than 20 generations, we have adopted a paradigm that is as close to the complete opposite of what appears to be best for us as you can get.  So the solution would appear to be simple: get back to our roots.  It is a goal of mine to find ways that we can all be provided the opportunity to participate in a tribal agrarian lifestyle again, and in doing so, we would ease the collective financial obligation we have on each other and ourselves and decrease the carbon footprint at the same time.  If there is a way that we can rapidly cut emissions and do what\u2019s best for our overall health, which we have been incessantly neglecting, this could solve those issues.  \n\nImagine a free-to-live community that had organic gardens that provided for the entire community that made the absolute best use of space for the highest yield, utilized solar technology for electricity, had top of the line water filtration systems, and made maximum use of everything.  With a little startup investment, there is no reason something like this would be impossible for everyone.  There is a question of how ideas such as this can be funded.  Where will the communities be?  Who will be allowed in?  How will they be governed?  There are many solutions that will need to be found for an idea such as this to be successful, all of which we can explore together.  I had the idea that we could create a crowd-fund that could be accompanied by a working model that would be easily replicable so that anyone that has the space and resources can provide space for facilities to be erected free of charge.  The crowd-fund could also be used to enlist the assistance of people at the pinnacles of sustainable architecture to ergonomically design these facilities as best we possibly can in ways that meet everyone\u2019s needs.  We can also utilize people at the pinnacles of sociology, permaculture, and much more to maximize the impact we are trying to deliver.  \n\nI know that this stuff seems far-fetched, but I\u2019d be willing to bet that everyone that has read up to this point is somewhat intrigued by the possibilities.  What people tend to forget is that WE collectively decide what\u2019s possible.  If this is something we all want, there are ways to get it accomplished, and we are all that stands in our way.  There have been people that I have shared these things with that have expressed strong support and declared their willingness to participate that just go right back to work and can\u2019t seem to find the energy to dedicate to something like this with everything else they have going on.  Unless we collectively snap out of the life we have, we can never create the life we want.  I contemplate the results that an idea like this can create, and I can almost feel the collective spiritual explosion that would result from it.  Imagine all of the new songs, sciences, creations, findings, and experiences we can create by freeing ourselves from obligation, taking the best of what today has to offer, and going back to living the old ways together.  Emphasizing that something like this may be our only option to avoid widespread suffering is nowhere near as powerful an attractant as getting people to realize how much spiritual freedom is waiting for us if we make it happen.  \n\nI already have a crew of people that are motivated and working towards the same goals that are with me in this endeavor, as they see the value.  If we combine as much effort and resources as possible into something sustainable that would only require a little bit of effort to run itself, we can be forever free.  Then, we can look at how we can make everything free for everyone where we wouldn\u2019t need a financial system.  If everything were free to everyone, we could recognize every day for the gift that it is and find broaden our collective horizons together.  We could heal the social problems that plague us and strengthen collective unity across the world through doing for others that are a part of the same whole.  I have hope even thought things are dark.  I understand that spiritual contentment has to come from within, but maybe what\u2019s missing is everyone saying that we all want what\u2019s best for each other, our lack of accessing resources being the only thing keeping us from doing so.  I would bet that many that have read this tell themselves from time to time that nobody cares and at times we would rather be alone.  I\u2019m here to tell you that I have put all of this thought and contemplation into these ideas because I love each and every one of you and don\u2019t want to see you suffer, and we collectively decide how much we put ourselves through.  It is one thing to declare yourself a pebble in the river, but it is quite another to come to take action once you come to the realization that YOU ARE the river.  We have been missing love, connection, empowerment, and hope.  These things are available to each other the very moment we decide to provide them and collectively share the weight.  \n\nPlease, if you\u2019d like to be involved in this project or just need someone to talk to, send me a message.  Those that have read this should understand that the only time we ever have to go through anything again is if we choose to.  If I had the ability, I would put an end to every single person\u2019s problems in any way that I could.  I am here for you and will do whatever is in my power to improve all of our lives.  This is not about politics, ideology, or money.  This is about survival and doing what\u2019s right.  I know people say that phrase \u201cwe are the ones we\u2019ve been waiting for\u201d, but how many of us take that to heart?  We can sit by and be social media warriors expressing our discontent at the shortcomings of society or we can decide to change it.   The current state of things is what happens when we do for ourselves instead of each other, and it can change whenever we want.  I\u2019m going full-steam ahead into this regardless of whether or not anyone else joins us, but I really hope you do because it will shorten the road to progress.  We are many but also one, and facing the darkness waiting for us, it\u2019s time we started acting like it.  \n\nI love you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71768, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I have some things I'd like to say", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e52ya9/i_have_some_things_id_like_to_say/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "you_are_marvelous", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1gz0u81a", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575310052, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e52v40/manifesting/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e52v40", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General"}], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e52v40/manifesting/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575310056, "score": 1, "selftext": "For years I used to hear people talk about manifesting what you want and shifting your mindset. That whole idea of what you put out there you get back. And in general, I do find that to be true. However, in one area I seemed to constantly struggle-- I had trouble manifesting the kind of wealth that I wanted. \n\nMy husband is the primary bread-winner, while I stayed home, homeschooled my kid until last year, and did various type of contract and specialized work (so my pay was inconsistent). He was also in charge of our finances (paid the bills, decided if we could afford to eat out or not...etc). But we always had *just* enough. So we'd get a windfall of money and then his car would breakdown and there goes the money we got in. We were always breaking even or catching up and then falling back. \n\nI believed this was due to my husband's mindset. At one point in his early life, he was homeless and ever since then he's had a kind of scarcity mindset. He's always so fearful of there not being enough money. I tend to also think this is a normal fear of someone being the primary bread-winner and having to support a family. But he would always say things like \"we can't do that, we're broke.\" I told him to stop saying \"we're broke\" because that's a lie and don't put that out there. We have enough money, just not the amount to do anything extra. I kept trying to get him to change his mindset and change the way he spoke about money and our finances and he never could make the shift. He's a bit better, but he always works (general home contractor) when we have enough money in case there's a time when we don't. So for him, there's always a \"dire\" need for cash. If we're doing okay, he'll still work weekends and extra hours \"in case\" something goes wrong and eventually, something goes wrong. Part of that is just how life is. Shit happens. Part of it, I do believe was him drawing in what he expected to happen. \n\nThere came a point this year when he was just at his wit's end and mentally and emotionally crashing and I took over the finances. We agreed that he would fork over all his paychecks and I'd give him an allowance and I'll do it all. This took a HUGE burden off of him, but it also put me in control. Thankfully, my husband and I are both of the same frugal mindset. We live a simple life and our attitudes towards money are the same. We're savers and wise with our money, so it's not like we have one person who's a spendthrift and the other who is a penny-pincher. \n\nSo I started taking over the finances and I have a different mindset. I assume that all the wealth we will ever need is there, and I don't worry about making our mortgage and paying our bills. But now, my husband doesn't have that worry either. He just makes the money and forks it over and I manage everything. So he's not putting his mindest out into the world about our finances. His mindset now is \"I make the money and my wife will support us with it. I have faith that she will handle it like a pro and we will always be okay.\" I also had to work on my mindset to get where I am today. For so long I would have people not pay me for my work, or I felt awkward asking for money for my services, and I felt I was undeserving of financial payment and wealth. I had to unravel that false belief about money to arrive where I'm at today. There was some emotional/spiritual work there for both of us to do.\n\nEver since I took over, we're doing great. We've had some really great financial windfalls that never happened before--like a credit card overcharging us in finance fees by accident and we got money back from that. I got off the phone with my friend this morning (who I haven't caught up with since June) and she gave me a job (one month's worth of work) creating a website for her company. Things like this keep happening over and over and my husband is like \"what are you, a money tree?\" I just said, \"No, it's my mindset.\" He said, \"Well you'll just do our finances forever then.\" Ahahaha!\n\nBut it did teach me some important things:\n\n1. I can't have something manifest for ME and my needs via someone else. When I would meditate, my guidance would tell me \"the money is there and will always be there when you need it. you will never be without.\" What I wasn't understanding is that couldn't come via my husband then transfer to me. It had to come FROM ME. I was trying to make it come from him because he was the one with the full-time job. But that's not how it works.\n2. When manifesting, make sure what you're trying to manifest is in your control, not someone else's. \n3. Trust and have faith that what your higher self/divine/guidance is telling you is the truth and then follow their advice. \n4. You have to believe, know, and feel that you are deserving of what you're trying to manifest. \n\nSo I just thought I'd share because this had been a block for me for a LONG time and I finally figured out why. Maybe it will help someone else. \n\nIf you're trying to manifest, make sure what you're trying to manifest isn't dependent on someone's else's vibration/frequency/attitude. It needs to be under your control (with the help of your divine support system) and make sure you feel 100% deserving of what you're trying to manifest. \n\nHope this helps! &lt;3", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71766, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Manifesting", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e52v40/manifesting/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AlinaAirline", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_cvcte", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575309445, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e52pp3/advice_to_best_utilise_a_3_week_solo_break_in_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e52pp3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e52pp3/advice_to_best_utilise_a_3_week_solo_break_in_the/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575309447, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi all! \n\nI do apologise if this is not the best place to post this but do hear me out...\n\nIn a couple of weeks I'm gonna be flying out to Portugal for a 3 week break by the sea. I'm going on my own to reset my mind, body and soul and to avoid the seasonal sensory overload. I absolutely cannot wait! I have been aching for something like this for years.\n\nI'm planning to start my days with a balanced breakfast and I want to spend most of my time walking or swimming or sitting or reading by the sea or pool. Maybe also meditation...\n\nI really want to make the most of this time, like really utilise it in a spiritual/developmental/restorative context. I've been working on myself consistently over the past years, overcoming and clearing a lot of old gunk, educating myself as best as I can in all things psychological, spiritual, magical and I've come real far. \n\nOf course I have been prone to relapses, namely with severe binge eating, smoking weed, taking speed... Despite these habitual relapses, I can actually now feel how these coping mechanisms just don't serve me at all anymore. None of these things even provide the fleeting joy of distraction they once did. I have mentally acknowledged my time engaging in these behaviours is coming to a close, and I want to stop putting off the thing I really want to do, which is to write my book. \n\nAnyway, getting to the grit now having waffled out a little context; I feel like this time away is going to be truly significant in terms of being able to relinquish what I'm unnecessarily holding onto mentally, simply by being in a new environment alone. And one that is going to be so natural and scenic and beautiful.\n\nWhat I'm asking I guess, is might there be anything else I could be doing aside from merely being in nature and away from all the noise that would best serve my mind body and soul? How best might I cleanse and ground myself? What kind of meditation could help? I am really a novice when it comes to meditation or mindfulness and would love some pointers on how to make the most of this lucky chance that I have to strip myself down and reassemble! \n\nThank you for sticking out my long post everyone!

My inner quest brought me to a spiritual festival, where many experts from around the world were giving lectures. A few of them took my attention and one was particularly interesting. This Swedish scientist was talking about **the Mayan calendar and how its cycles explain biological and social evolution**...\n\nTwo years later, I find myself giving lectures, explaining the meaning of the Mayan calendar.  \nThe name of this Swedish author is Carl Calleman, and we had a good connection until 2010 when I split opinions with him. A long story, which deserves another email...  \nHe also introduced me to the Mayan Astrology when he visited Turkey in 2006. I got my first training by being a translator to Turkish for his individual sessions.\n\nAt that moment, there were not many sources on this subject. He was carrying an old and deformed version of the Jaguar Wisdom, a book by Kenneth Johnson, who became my mentor and friend later on.\n\nSince that first contact with the Mayan Astrology, I read whatever I could find about it. Also, I got insights from the Mayan elder Elizabeth Araujo on my visit to Guatemala.  \nStill, up to date, there are not so many resources on this subject, mostly because Mayans keep their traditions secret and not very comfortable sharing with the outsiders.\n\nNevertheless, to be honest with you, **most of my work is not intellectual but intuitive**. Over the years I did individual sessions with more than 500 people.

This is because to me, words, ideas, beliefs don't have meaning. I give it meaning. Most people look at things on a surface level. I sort of, know the cheats for how this reality works. idk, let's use the word demon. Demons are associated with negativity, evil, sin, corruption. Right, okay, but what if you change your mindset on what a demon is. To something that is not the things listed above. Then the word no longer means what it is associated with. What if you call yourself a demon, yet for you a demon means an all powerful being of darkness. But darkness is not necessarily evil. At least, it may not be to that person. It could mean evil for another. \n\nHere's the point. This word or idea means this, and it becomes exactly that if you believe. It becomes something else if you change your perspective on it, and change the meaning. So this is why i sort of don't understand most things people talk about. \n\nI feel like i don't fit in, even with spiritual people. Because it's not that i know more, it's just i see things differently. \n\nLet's look at the ego. A lot of spiritual people say you should go away from that. They try to make the ego self out to be an enemy. I disagree. Without the Ego, do people realize there is no value to anything in existence? Everything may as well be dead or nonexistent. Ego gives value to existence. The way i see it, God is all that is, awareness, everything. Consciousness is God's experience. Now you should not get lost in your ego, but ego is not bad. Everyone is God. To me. Some are aware of that, some are not, but they still are. \n\nI'm also not a fan of the whole \"dreams have meaning\". To me it means whatever the hell you want it to mean. You can change the meaning of something to your benefit. Nothing has meaning, you give it meaning. Dreams are associated with not the real reality.

Some great great great Grandfather provided a meal for his family because he was lucky enough to kill a deer after hunting in the cold for days. Some past Mother of my Mother's Mother's Mother chose to feed her children and so went hungry.\n\nAnyways, I was driving the 2 miles or so in peace and comfort and I got to the local grocery store\u2026 a place filled with fresh fruit, a wide variety of safely sourced high quality meats, a place with flowers, chocolate, soup, Cajun seasoning, cakes, soy sauce, lemon pepper potato chips, and anything else I could POSSIBLY want. And to secure these goods I merely presented a small card that showed that I could pay for it with money I earned doing art at parties. I paid for EVERYTHING because I can make people smile at parties. My family was warm, dry, well fed, AND entertained\u2026 because I have the simple ability to make people happy for a brief amount of time by putting names on things or painting naked people.\n\nAnd in my mind hundreds of generations of ancestors stretched out behind me\u2026 some very prosperous\u2026but many who struggled and toiled and begged and suffered to survive.\n\nAnd THEN, I really really understood why I should give thanks.\n\nAnd I came home to our large, warm, comfortable, dry, house to find my family members making treats and watching digitally recorded memories of us at Disneyland\u2026 spending our money in order to sing and dance and have other people entertain us.\n\nMiracles and wonders.\n\nI am agnostic. I don\u2019t pretend to know what, who, or why I should be grateful towards. But in these moments I am truly grateful to my ancestors, all those who came before me who toughed out life and raised their kids who raised their kids who raised their kids who raised me. I am grateful to all human kind, and our amazing ability to work together to create a life that is full of wonder and is so much easier than it has ever been for any generation before us. So I just try to express gratitude and hope that if there is some sort of force or being that is responsible for all that is right in the world...that it/they will hear me.\n\nI heard a podcast once, about the amazing number and variety of humans it takes to make a simple pencil....and my life is filled with such objects. I certainly couldn't make a pencil, or a fuel injector, or Lucky Charms Cereal, or a stereo speaker on my own.\n\nAnd it hit me like a psychic brick. There is an unfathomable amount of stuff to be grateful for.\n\nAnyways, that is what occurred to me while driving to the grocery store....and now I send it to you...all over the world, instantly, and very little cost, from my warm room, while listening to really good music while the storm rages outside... for you to do with what you will.\n\nWhat is something in your life that you are grateful for that you take for granted every day?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71664, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Grateful Agnostic - a post Thanksgiving giving of thanks", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4ufjr/grateful_agnostic_a_post_thanksgiving_giving_of/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "BrightCourage", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3v5iz16f", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575261754, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4tt24/am_i_experiencing_kundalini_long_post/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e4tt24", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e4tt24/am_i_experiencing_kundalini_long_post/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575261758, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello fellow humans . I'm in need in of your opinions .. .\n\nCouple of years ago i was driven by 'change' .. so i choose a destination and went for it . Got a job that i didnt liked, then got another , stress was trought the roof . I moved in with some people i didnt know and obviosuly got into some drugs .. but alchool was my  friend since my early teen years and has goten worse lately . I was a mess and i was dealing with a bad depression because me and my girlfriend broke up .\n\n I'm pretty sure that i was dealing with some narcisistic people at home and maybe some at work who litterally played me and fucked me upp pretty good . I'm not sure about the narcistic but im pretty sure that they fucked me up . Long story short .. the sleep depravation , drugs , stress , bad people in my life and everything else i was dealing from before cummulated and i ended up having pretty bad anxiety issues . And when im saying bad, i mean psychosis type bad . On top of that i smoked some bad weed at some point on which that i litterely experienced a burst of freakin energy trought my brain and flashes , it was insanse , like all my neurons or whatever the fuck is in our brains simultaniously fired or backfired .\n\nBut i think that was the actual start  and i got better after like 2 days from that . Also probably the weed was laced with some weird shit (most certainly).Thing is that even before this .. i litteraly had periods when i felt my eyes were literally on top of my forehead like i was a spectator . Later i found out this was called derealization and depersonalization , hurray . I got realy anxios and decided to move and stayed at a relative for like 1 year , in this period anxiety was hell on earth besides that paranoia got in on the job and obviosly from time to time psychosis because my brain coundt handle all the stress . I went to the doctor after 1 year of all this bullshit and he gave mean antypsychotic which i took for a year in which my depression got kinda bad and obviously i needed and antidepressant and then my sleeping habbits got bad because you cant sleep if you lay in bed all day , add some sleeping pills and obviosly something for anxiety . I was still feeling like shit and i was even more paranoid than when i started , very fucking paranoid .When i stoped the medication with doctors advice obviosuly i couldnt feel anything for 3 months , i was dull .. but the smallest pure thing .. could make me smile .. was kinda strange .\n\nI wanted to die, and i was fine with it i considered every method and how i should do it , i was done . But hey , here i am . It's been 1 year since i quited medication  ..and i only experienced like 1 major psychosis incident .. but my psychosis never lasts more than 2-3 hours and it's so deep in my mind if someone sees me thinks im fine . It's determined by my levels of anxiety . The last few months were good ,not much paranoia , still a lot of anxiety but it's quite ok .I stumbled on kundalini information about after 3 months after quiting my meds searching for litterally \"what the fuck do i have \" since i took all major mental health problems and read everything about them and i just cant put myself into 1 category . I either have 1 symptom of something or nothing at all . I did all the medical tests possible and nothing seems wrong , i even did brain scans .. everything is fine . First time watching someone talk about kundalini i was like .. 'bruh .. you;re crazy but that has to be bullshit \" even if from 11 'symptoms' they described i had like 10 . 6 months passed(after no med) and i felt better .. my symptoms are .. :\n\n\t\\- Involuntary twitches \n\n\t\\- Ear buzzing which litterally goes On and Off \n\n\t\\- High sensitivity to light and after like 6+ months i got this weird dots of light poping out in my vision \n\n\t\\- At this moment i just bought a drawing tablet to draw a thing which i never did since i was like 10 years old and never actually was interested in .\n\n\t\\-Periods when entering automode and just thinking about stuff while actually doing something else like a robot ( at the start it was all negative .. now not so much )\n\n\t\\- I bought a boxing bag just to exercise and i started jogging \n\n\t\\- In the beggining i had some weird freaking dreams about catching snakes that didnt wanted to be caught and me luring them with mice in my dreams ( and i litterally have a big phobia about snakes cant even watch images of them .. but in my dreams i'm fkin superman also ) \n\n\t\\- I litterally started to stop my nightmares when i wanted , i litterally stared at a vampire abomination for like 1 minute and i tought it was funny untill my concious mind said no no time to wake up . \n\n\t\\- My interest in art , philosophy , religion , science , music , photography is ... unimaginable .. i'm consuming so much information sometimes shit get's mixed up .\n\n\t\\- I experience an internal purging .. every bad deed that i had done .. is somehow brought back to me and not only makes me feel like shit but i deconstruct it .\t- It feels like im defragmenting my brain and putting the pieces in place .\n\n\t\\- Sunsets , nice views , fragile animals or animals in general make my heart pop out and i smile so much sometimes i pop a litle tear on my eyes .\n\n\t\\- I don;t feel depressed but neither happy .. more like neutral . The only thing that makes me depressed is the tought of someone which i have lost but i choose not to go that way because it's to painfull and even if i reach a conclusion .. my feelings will not let go either way . \n\n\t\\- Headaches .. oh i hate these ... \n\n\t\\- Numbness in face and rarely limbs ... not so much lately tought .. \n\n\t\\- I just feel like a fountain of ideeas and i get so worked up sometimes i loose it . I wake up in the morning and i think .. what the hell maybe that's not a good ideea for a drawing or video .. or for personal development . \n\n\t\\- I just laugh at stuff more often .\n\n\t\\- I litterally had a whole week on which i was seeing things with a pink shade like that of a sunset . \n\n\t\\- I don't have a social life right now because i just dont feel like i can handle it,but i do work and i'm being quite productive even if i was kinda lazy all my life .\n\n\t\\- I question myself on every single aspect \n\n\t\\- I observe things which i didnt before .. \n\n\t\\- I'm so angry sometimes by the presence of people that bother me with usual questions or that disrupt my space i wanna litterally smash their head .. but i dont do it ..i know that they can't understand ..\n\n\t\\- I'm angry at meaningless conversations .. at conversations about people .. at small talk ...\n\nIt feels like i lived an illusion .. in which i still live .. but now i can see more atleast even if sometimes my toughts go into heavy anxiety mode and fuck with me .\n\n\t\\- I feel like rapid toughts just switch off when i reach a pertinent conclusion about something ... i litterally feel that in my brain .. but also in my mind .\n\n\tI'm no adept of love is the answear .. how can you love something that hurt you in the past ? I'd rather ignore it and smash it's fucking head off if it bothers me again ... it's a passive love .. also after all budhists monks learned to fight for a reason i suppose . I think both love and hate are the answear .. and the balance between them is the a key .\n\n\tI just feel im on a path of achieving something but nothing at the same time . My ego and probably my soul ? are at war and i need to make peace between these 2 idiots . \n\n\tIt feels like a constant fight .. or maybe i'm just crazy .. or possessed .. or braindamaged or... actually very retarted( also btw , lots of bullshit information on kundalini online) . Maybe i need to find God or myself .. quite funny since i was an atheist for the first 20 years of my life . \t\n\n\tMy biggest advice is .. just let go of your fear (also try not to be stupid .. like : You are not actually afraid of going into a lions cage and cuddle with him .. but it's not reccomended due to big claws and big appetite . ). Also learn to laugh .\n\nI don't even know why i wrote this right now ..i feel like i reached a conclusion by the end of the post which tommorow is going to be questioned again .. or maybe a week from now .. . Gonna post it anyway ..\n\n  \nSo... ?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71649, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Am i experiencing kundalini ?

Idk man I\u2019m just here. I have no idea what\u2019s going on but I know it\u2019s good..? I\u2019m an 18F and a whole bunch of crazy shit happened this year that led me to this \u201cawakening\u201d I guess? I never experienced anything like supernatural or some crazy light show or some shit. I just became more aware after I decided to go to therapy towards the beginning of the year. It would be too much to type out, and I\u2019m sure I would run out of character count. When I figured out about \u201cthe matrix\u201d (not the movie) I think I got so overwhelmed &amp; excited that I bit off more than I could chew. I watched so many videos, read so many reddit posts and basically just overloaded myself with so much information that I created my own downfall. I don\u2019t see it as a downfall now, I see it as a lesson. I beat myself up because I wasn\u2019t consistent with meditation &amp; wasn\u2019t freaking going vegan in time enough lmfaoo. I\u2019m really just thinking to myself like wow. This is my own journey. Who gives a fuck?! Clearly I care about meditation and taking care of myself in general. I just don\u2019t have to be perfect. Nobody is. Im changing my ways. I might not have been meditating on a regular basis, but with therapy &amp; taking the knowledge I\u2019ve researched &amp; applying that to my life, I\u2019ve seen so much change in these months. I\u2019m literally changing in front of myself it\u2019s crazy. I\u2019m so much more compassionate, sensitive, and loving. But I\u2019m also more judgmental about the bad things I think of or when I\u2019m not doing something by the \u201claws\u201d. Not the laws the bullshit ass government pass out or whatever. But the laws of this universe. At this point I\u2019m just ranting. This post has no.. i don\u2019t even know the word. Basically this is my online diary if you will. The old me would\u2019ve never done something like this so I\u2019m just saying fuck it. *shoulder shrug*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71642, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "bare with me", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4t2zn/bare_with_me/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Jumlee77", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_50pvp89v", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575255969, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4sn7m/do_chakras_really_exist/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e4sn7m", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e4sn7m/do_chakras_really_exist/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575255971, "score": 1, "selftext": "Where is the proof of them?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71630, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do chakras really exist?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4sn7m/do_chakras_really_exist/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "madsibb", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3tzvpd8d", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575255862, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4sme7/how_to_cope/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e4sme7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e4sme7/how_to_cope/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575255864, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve been reading about numbers and horoscopes, meditating , but I can\u2019t seem to find this answer myself . \n\nSo basically I\u2019m in love with my friend LC .

this life or do I have to go through many lives?\nWill I awaken in this life?\nWill I become free in this life or do I have to go on playing games like everybody else, making believe, when will I awaken?\"\nAnd it's very funny to me.\nMy answer is never!\nYou'll never awaken!\n\nIt's like the water in the mirage asking,\n\"When will I become real water?\nHow long do I have to be a mirage?\nWhen will I become the real water?\"\nOf course it will never become the real water.\nFor the mirage can never become anything but a mirage.\nIt will always be a mirage.\nSo it is with us.\nWhat you are can never be anything else.\nFor you do not exist as a body at all.\nAnd if you do not exist as a body what can become self-realized?\nIn other words you have nothing to become self-realized with.\nYou cannot become self-realized it's impossible.\nForget about it.\nDon't even think of it.\n\nSelf-realization has absolutely nothing to do with your body or your thoughts or your mind or your practices or your sadhanas or anything else.\nSelf-realization is the ultimate reality.\nIt is the pure awareness, the nirvana and that doesn't exist either.\nSo what exists?\nThere is no answer.\nFor what exists can never be known with a finite mind.\nThis is why we do the work from where we are.\nWe do not think about becoming self-realized or becoming liberated.\nWe simply wonder who we are.\nWe just ask ourselves, \"Where does this body come from?\nWhat appears to be a body?\"\nAnd we compare it to the water in the mirage.\nIt's an hallucination.\nIt has no validity.\nIn other words you have no existence whatsoever.\n\nYou have never had an existence.\nNothing exists.\nYet we appear to exist.\nSo what to do?\nNothing, there is nothing you can do about it.\nThat's just the way it is.\nDo not try to change it.\nStay the way you are and keep still.\nThat is the best thing you can do.\nBe happy just the way you are.\nOf course the only way you can be happy is by keeping still and not reacting to things, by leaving everything alone and being yourself.\nWhen I say, \"Being yourself\", I mean being you the way you are right now, nothing else.\nThe world of reality exists by itself.\nIt just is.\n\nThere is nothing you can do to change anything.\nDo not try to change anything.\nDo not work on yourself.\nFor every time you're working on yourself you are emphasizing that you're the self, the mortal self that needs to be worked at.\n\"just be yourself\" the way you are right now, in this moment.\nI'm not saying to be your self last week or to be your self a week from now.\nBe yourself right this moment, this second, this instant and you'll be safe.\nDo not concern yourself how to be the self.\nDo not concern yourself what you have to do to be the self.\nDon't even wonder what it is to be the self.\nJust be!\n\nDo not question it.\nDo not try to understand it.\nYou will always be the way you are, nothing will can ever change that.\nSo you might as well get on with that and be happy.\nSuffering comes when you try to change yourself.\nSuffering ensues when you try to develop moksha, liberation.\nWhen you try to transcend yourself, then you suffer.\nFor you are trying to attain something that doesn't exist and it hurts.\n\nIsn't it wonderful not to do anything.\nNever try to attain a thing or become anything else.\nWhat about pain, what about lack and limitation, what about poverty.\nWhat about the rest of these things that exist?\nIt's all part of life.\nDo not try to get rid of it.\nLook at it, accept it, be happy with it and leave it alone.\n\nWhat I'm really saying is, \"Get your mind off yourself\".\nStop thinking about yourself.\nStop thinking about anybody else.\nWhatever is supposed to come to you will come to you.\nWhatever you are supposed to have you will have.\nWherever you have to go you will go.\nYou have absolutely nothing to do with it.\nSo why not enjoy where you are right this moment.\nStop trying to change things.\nThe very trying makes them worse.\nThe body that you're wearing right now is an hallucination.\nYou are not that person whatsoever.\nBut because you appear as that person you go through many experiences of what that person has to go through.\nDo not fight it.\nDo not try to change it.\nLeave everything alone.\nYou'll be very surprised at what happens if you leave everything alone.\nBut when you try to change bad for good you're fighting a losing battle for it cannot be done.\n\nYou may tell me of people who have used their mind to achieve things in the world, to heal themselves of disease, to heal themselves of lack or limitation, to become powerful beings through thinking.\nThose things are only changes, temporary changes.\nDo not try to be a human being.\nGo beyond that.\nYou go beyond that by doing nothing.\nYet some of you do not understand and think you have to sit down like a lump and do nothing on the contrary.\nWhen you're doing nothing you're doing something.\nSomething is being done.\nSomething will always be done by you.\nYet at the same time nothing is being done.\nSo the question is, \"Is something being done or is nothing being done?\" and there is no answer.\nWhat do you want to achieve and why do you wish to achieve those things?\nOnly for your self aggrandizement.\nAn animal leads a normal life.\nIt cannot think like we do.\nIt goes through its life and when it's time to leave their life it leaves it peacefully, happily.\nBut as human beings we fight, trying to live forever.\nTrying to maintain the same beauty we've always had, the same happiness, the same joy.\nThis is all a waste of energy.\n\nAll is well, just the way it is.\nYou are perfect just the way you are.\nThere is nothing that you have to do.\nThere is no-one you have to please.\nThere is no God that you have to appease.\nYou are the one.\nAll of these ideas that are going through your mind of people, places, things, Gods, are all you.\nYou are creating everything.\nEverything that you can think about you're creating.\nEverything comes out of yourself.\nJust like you're dreaming.\nThe mistake we make is we try to awaken from the dream, the mortal dream, from this dream.\nYet who is to awaken from it?\nThe person that wants to awaken doesn't exist.\nDo you see what I'm saying?\nNothing exists that has to do anything.\nThe person who wants to be free does not exist, has never existed.\nThe person who is looking for moksha does not exist.\nThen again what does exist?\nTotal silence exists.\nPure profound silence.\nNever try to comprehend these things.\nFor you're using the mind, you're using the cells that are the mind, that are connected to the cells of the universe and you make your life miserable by doing this.\n\nThere is no difference between you and a tree or a mountain, a sky or the ocean.\nThe whole universe is composed of hydrogen atoms.\nSo you're nothing but a hydrogen atom.\nHow does it feel to be a hydrogen atom?\nSee how you mind begins to think?\nIt's difficult for most of you to stay silent.\nYou are not required to understand a thing I say.\nI speak utter nonsense.\nIt's all nonsense and some of you are taking it in so profoundly like it's important.\n\nWho are you really?\nI have no idea?\nIf you have an idea of who you are you've got a problem.\nFor you're not that at all.\nAgain we go back to the beginning when I opened up this sentence.\nWho thinks they're something.\nYou can never be anything.\nThe 'you' that you think you are can never be a thing.\nAlways remember this.\nThe 'you' can never become anything.\nThe only freedom you really have is to be still and quiet and that is the only freedom you've got.\nTo be totally quiet.\nEverything else is an hallucination, a lie.\nSo most of you want me to sit here and tell you lies.\nStop worrying.\nStop fretting.\nStop believing something can happen to you, to hurt you.\nWhat you are was never born.\nIt knows nothing of birth.\nThe one that knows about birth and death doesn't exist.\n\nSo here we are together again.\nWhy do you come here?\nIf you have a reason for coming here it's the wrong reason.\nThere is no reason for doing anything at all.\n\n(long silence...)\n\n~ Robert Adams, When Will I Awaken?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id":

To recognize it, you put on various uniforms in order to give it an identity, but that principle is already there, and because of that principle you are engaging in various activities. Unless you wear the uniform (the body) you will not be able to conduct any activities. This knowledge is meant for the Isvara principle, which is presently caught up in the illusion that it is the body-mind. You have accepted the identity of the uniform and that identity becomes your ego. Isvara is the manifest principle by which all activities are carried on. It has no form - the forms are given because of the five elemental play. Now, that principle gets completely lost in the uniform and is recognized by the uniform only. You have the fear of death because you fear losing your identity, the body. Since the uniform is available to you, by all means use it, but understand that you are not the uniform.\n\nQ: What does one do when the uniform gets troublesome?\n\nM: Recede into your own Self, be one with your true Self. This \"I Amness\" enjoys various experiences. It becomes a beggar or a King. Is this body eternal? The body has been changing all during your life, which identity is you?\n\nQ: I identify myself with my body, I know that.\n\nM: Who?\n\nQ: I do.\n\nM: Give me a photograph of the meaning of that word \"I\". You can't. That principle has no name or form or shape. My firm conclusion is that whatever is done through the uniform is perishable, it is not going to remain. Which uniform has any permanency? Once you know that you are not the form or the name of that uniform, it is all over. Suppose you have hoarded some thousand-rupee notes and suddenly the government order comes that they are all invalidated. Once you discard this \"I Amness\" uniform, what remains is the Parabrahman. That which is eternally current is the Parabrahman.\n\nQ: Will Maharaj help me discard my uniform?\n\nM: What is the need? It is not eternal, it never was.\n\nQ: We have not discarded ours, that is the problem.\n\nM: Now, tell me, when the knowingness was not there, what experiences did you have? That little touch of \"I Amness\" and you felt the existence of yourself and the world.\n\nQ: How to give up this knowingness?\n\nM: Where is the need? If you accept that uniform as yourself, then the question of giving it up will be there. Give up your identity with the body, try to know yourself. It is merely knowingness, you cannot perceive that state. You come here because you are ignorant, not because you are knowledgeable. This knowledge I give is only to remove ignorance.\n\nNisargadatta Maharaj, Consciousness and the Absolute, December 25, 1980", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71599, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Body Is Like A Uniform", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4qzlg/the_body_is_like_a_uniform/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Saggitaries", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4y1qvoby", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575247416, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4qucn/youtube_subminal_community/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e4qucn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e4qucn/youtube_subminal_community/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575247417, "score": 1, "selftext": "What  do you guys think about this community? \n\nCan we really change the way we appear?

So this is another full post from my blog where I channel a being called \u201cZero\u201d It\u2019s part one of two, the second, \u201cHow to Contact Your Spirit Guides\u201d is currently up ( and I can post that here too if there\u2019s interest - trying not to be spammy) or you can head over there now if you like.\n\nHere we go!\n\nSo today I wanted to talk a little bit about Spirit Guides. Early on, when I was a kid, this was a big interest for me. I loved the idea I might have this sort of invisible side kick that would get me out of jams or hang out with me when I was lonely. I didn\u2019t hear anyone answer when I asked questions so I sort of forgot about it. Years later when I suddenly was able to \u201chear\u201d him I wasn\u2019t as excited \u2013 instead I thought my mind was breaking. Over time and some serious testing I grew to trust and understand more about what was happening and who my guide actually was and since then, it\u2019s a lot like what I thought when I was a kid. Except instead of getting me out of jams, he helps me get myself out of jams. There\u2019s a difference and it\u2019s less cool (but probably more helpful ultimately).\n\nAnyway, it has been a very rewarding experience for me so I want to talk a lot about our guides, who they are, how they speak to us, and how we communicate with them.\n\nSo today let\u2019s start with the basics. I contacted Zero for his perspective which you can read below (I\u2019m the questions, Zero is in quotations):\n\n\nWhat are Spirit Guides?\n\n\u201cSpirit Guides are beings that agree to help you during your incarnation. They will often have had similar experiences to what you\u2019re going to go through and can provide support and guidance. That may be specific to an experience or to life in an incarnation. On the other hand they may not have had any experience in what you might go through during your incarnation but will act as a spiritual anchor or sorts. Someone or something you can always turn to regardless of the situation that occurs.\u201d\n\n\nAre all beings connected to some form of spirit guide?\n\n\n\u201cAll beings have a guiding force to which they are always connected to. It\u2019s part of the mechanics of incarnation into the physical from the non-physical. For some it\u2019s simply the connection to source, for others it\u2019s a separate being or group of beings. It could also be another version of yourself. There are no hard rules for this and it\u2019s usually decided upon before you incarnate.\u201d \n\n\nAre you always in contact with your guide?\n\n\n\u201cStrong distraction or emotion can make it difficult for some to clearly interpret a message and you can even create the feeling of being separated from your guides, but you are always connected. You can not be separated or prevented from receiving their messages by outside elements.\u201d\n\n\nIn our relationship, are you considered a guide?\n\n\n\u201cYou may consider us a guide but we are not what you would consider your primary guide. We are linked through a relationship you can\u2019t yet remember fully but the basis of our interaction with you has been planned since before your incarnation on Earth.\u201d\n\n\nWe have more than one guide?\n\n\n\u201cMany of you will have other guides with you during your incarnations. Some will be with you from the beginning to the end of your life cycle while others might only be with you for certain stages or even just come through for a particular moment. These guides can take many forms, from beings some call angels, ancestors, loved ones that have left their incarnation, groups of beings, your akashic records keeper, other people\u2019s spirit guides, mountains, trees, Earth herself\u2026 the possibilities are endless and unique to the individual.\u201d\n\n\nThanks to Zero for sharing this. When I first received this info the world really opened up for me. Not only are we never truly alone, we have a universe to potentially reach out to. I felt this wave of support wash over me and I\u2019m now able to walk into challenging situations and know, even if it\u2019s just me I can see, I have a support team to help guide me through. And you do, too.\n\n\nTalk soon,\n\n~Dave\n\n\nHey I just wanted to take a second here and thank you for reading. I\u2019m over the moon there\u2019s people out there as interested in this stuff as I am.

I really apologize if this is not being posted in the correct sub. I'm a 23 year old who is a teacher. Since the age of 7, I have wanted to be a teacher and it had been my goal up until the last 3 semester of my college career. Towards the final year and a half of college, I started getting thoughts and the feeling \"This isn't what I'm supposed to do with my life. I'm meant for more than this.\" I thought that maybe I was just frustrated with college classes, so I ignored it and kept going. I also didn't want to just quit without having given teaching a chance. The feeling has grown even stronger now. So fast forward to now. I moved 1300 miles away, and am teaching elementary school, but I'm the unhappiest I've ever been. I hate my job, and am at my witts end with it, but idk what else to do. I LOVE where I moved to, and I love my apartment, but I can't afford to live here off of minimum wage, not do I really want to. I really don't want to move back home, but I also don't want to continue teaching. My goal is to finish up this school year and then (by the grace of God) have a different career by May/June so that I don't have to continue teaching next school year. The downfall is that I have no idea what job I could do that wouldn't require an income decrease, or a return to college. I don't want either of those things. I believe that working for myself is what I truly want to do, but I have no idea what I'd do.

I became very self-conscious when I was on meds. This caused anxiety and lots of insecurity and self-doubt, yet, it made me see parts of me I\u2019ve been oblivious about for all my life. I became insecure because I was so unaware of myself that when I became somewhat aware, I felt like I don\u2019t know me and this caused self-doubt. \n\nBut realizing that I don\u2019t know me was what led me to start seeing myself better.\n\nYet... after this process happened, I quit Strattera. I told myself now I\u2019m more aware and I can handle myself without the help of meds.\n\nBut, after three months now, I realized that I\u2019m going back to my old patterns.\n\nOn Strattera, I would exercise, I would meditate, I would read and I would look within. Yes it caused other problems, but at least I was capable of doing something about the problems. \n\nThree months without meds and I no longer do any of these things. I want to, I really do, but I just don\u2019t do them (Classic adhd). My anxiety is gone, but so is my mood for looking within. \n\nSo it\u2019s basically like this: I could bash all western medication and tell myself I have to become capable of making it on my own. Meanwhile, lose the ability to participate in any self-help activity. Resulting in not making it on my own!\n\nOr I could accept the fact that I could use both eastern and western methods, giving myself all the help I could. To at least semi- make it on my own!\n\nP.S: I\u2019m eastern and here the opposition to western medicine is strong, so maybe things I\u2019ve said are not culturally relevant to west, I honestly don\u2019t know!!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71569, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "More self-conscious on meds -&gt; more participation in self-help activities", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4ofz5/more_selfconscious_on_meds_more_participation_in/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Wenderu84", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3zx8w59a", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575236357, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4o8kb/game_gear/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e4o8kb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e4o8kb/game_gear/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "AFqKW5DJ1fqYhmCnu0Jou2yJx3CCdOOikMH5gUJ-xEU", "resolutions": [{"height": 79, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Te0PP7hX8QnPwaj6sliA_JVMcCzYjaERGFMyWkmrcAg.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=877214fac751ab5f01d28cda94f866ffaa92db60", "width": 108}, {"height": 159, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Te0PP7hX8QnPwaj6sliA_JVMcCzYjaERGFMyWkmrcAg.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cf690b7b9d84a10b7020b7be8921a09eb434495", "width": 216}, {"height": 236, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Te0PP7hX8QnPwaj6sliA_JVMcCzYjaERGFMyWkmrcAg.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff88cf711bd1609fe9e44af6ea1b0130b802bc4d", "width": 320}, {"height": 472, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Te0PP7hX8QnPwaj6sliA_JVMcCzYjaERGFMyWkmrcAg.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a9cd3da6b637040086344b84c2ac3eed8bbe490", "width": 640}], "source": {"height": 591, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Te0PP7hX8QnPwaj6sliA_JVMcCzYjaERGFMyWkmrcAg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=4c938d1269b832451c2a488dd50bd44ff71d3e27", "width": 800}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1575236359, "score": 1, "selftext": "This Book Is a Game\n\nQuest 2: Game Gear\n\nNovember 2, 2019\n\nEquipment is something generally used in all games. We have seen both sides of the spectrum in video games, some games giving you unlimited inventory space while others give you seemingly less than in real life. Our possessions and how we make use of them is an integral part of This Book Is a Game. Unfortunately this game does not have never ending pockets, so I have had to make a lot of important decisions regarding what I keep on and near my person. We live in a world where we are burdened down by all in which we own. The truth is that what we own owns us. I have spent great efforts throughout my life to live with very few possessions. But just because I live out of a suitcase doesn't mean that I don't have nice things. Nor does it mean that I can't afford more. In fact, players are mobile creatures. And as a player you need to be ready to play. And that playing may restrict the amount of space that you have to carry things. Because the love of your life may just one day pop up from around the corner and if she does you need to be ready to act. But this is not the only reason to keep a tidy book bag. The truth is that the more stuff we have, the more it weighs on our psychology, as we are required to protect it. And this isn't even my final point as the organisational level of our equipment will reflect how organised we are in life. I constantly spend many hours going through all of my stuff and reorganising it, getting rid of what I don't want and putting what I do want in better places. Just consider this for a second. How organised am I? I have spent my life doing this. What I do own is awesome. And what I do own is awesomely organised. Doing this is a process. Doing this is an action. It is like in a game when I obtain new armour and sell the old. It is like getting your inventory perfect, and then saving the game to ensure everything is precisely the way you like it. It feels great to have little but what I do have, is quality. It feels great for it all to be in its place and easily accessible by me. Things in which are essential are divided from those which are not. This is how you \"armour-up\". This is how you shed the dead skin. This process is called ecdysis and is essential to our future human evolution.\n\nYou can choose whatever organisational method you please, however, I will share the techniques in which I have learned to utilise room. I have two tool bags, one for tools and a slightly larger one for anything important to me. The bags are further divided into smaller bags and sometimes even further into smaller bags. Everything is protected and has a home. I also have other less important bags that have things like my Switch game cases in it. It has taken me a long time to give everything an appropriate home where it was protected. But eventually all of God's creatures found a home where they were protected and loved. Packing a bag is a lot like playing Tetris. It uses the same parts of the brain that playing Tetris does. The goal is to maximise efficiency while minimising wasted space. The goal of this game world is to maximise efficiency by minimising wasted space. There are so many people in this world who are trash. It is time we expose the trash for its true smells. The rotting corpses of the zombies of this world will eventually decompose to allow the potential for a new creation. And from it shall rise a new kind of man, one who has it all, both bronze and brain. But do not forget the most important part of this statue in which I rapidly carve onto. That is the tear drop rolling down his cheek after experiencing what our society has truly become. For without heart, words are devoid of any meaning. Without interpretation (individual) the picture (collective) can never be understood.\n\nYou should not only be thinking of yourself when organising and collecting your gear. This is especially relevant if you record video in your gaming adventures. Your possessions should scream you. And remember the power of a camera. If your possessions are recorded then to a certain extent, you always have them. This is much more effective with filming things like something your grandmother made you instead of a phone, as a phone is rendered useless when it is recorded whereas a cross stitch that my mother made me can be carried with me always merely by recording it. Your possessions are not only what you carry but also what you film. This takes away from the need to keep too many sentimental items. And to be honest, it really depends on your gaming starting position as to how you will play it. I am merely one player that is trying to give you ideas as to what your playthrough might look like. Having your possessions carry your personality with them will help you be more relatable to your fans. It will also make your adventures more fun.\n\nThere are hidden treasures all throughout this game. The most valuable of them have no price tag on them. They are treasures of the spirit and infuse into your character. They oftentimes give you new and unique abilities in which carries over into your main game. Sometimes these jewels are as simple as a new character, maybe one that will change your game for the better for now and the rest of time. Maybe it is your new best friend or if you are lucky, your new life partner.\n\nIt is strategically advantageous to be light on your feet in this game. One must be prepared for anything to happen. I am a mobile person. If I find the right job opportunity, I am there. If I find the right woman in this game, I am there. This game heavily relies on one seeing clearly to flourish within it. This means that one must have their priorities aligned with their possibilities. Real opportunities in this life are the ones most people will never take because it upsets their business as usual. A real opportunity would likely take me away from the location in which I currently reside. As a result, I am a portable warrior.\n\nLet's revisit the process of ecdysis as this will be vital to performing an enjoyable playthrough. You need to learn the terminology in order to become efficient with the process. This process is called revitalisation and will be necessary to recoup your strength in between missions. You need to first shed the dead skin (all the crap you no longer need) and then fortify yourself with everything you do need for the future. Keep it organised so accessing and utilising your gear is easy. Doing this is especially important before the boss fights. For if you lose the battle, your place was saved and you can still fight to win the war. Don't let failures discourage you. In truth the only failure is giving up. All else is an educational process. The definition of a purge is to rid someone or something of an unwanted quality, condition, or feeling. This process is how you clean yourself from the filth of the world and its disgusting NPCs. It is your shower and you will need to often use it to revitalise your spirit. This process involves reducing your worldly possessions to a minimum. After you get used to this type of lifestyle, there is never a reason to unpack. That is unless you find your twin flame player and manage to be able to afford to purchase a home together.

This is often referred to as the, vibes, or vibrations you get from a person. Aura sensing is demonstrated in children between the ages of four and six. For example, when drawing family members, some children use a specific color for each person. They do so because they sense the human aura, although they do not consciously realize it. Parents and teachers often question them about why they have chosen these specific colors. Believing that there might be something wrong about drawing this way because of all the questioning, the children eventually stop. As they continue to mature, the ability fades as logic gets in the way of psychic abilities.\n\n\u00a0\nEach one of us encounters many different feelings and situations. These happenstances, negative or positive, are processed and reflected in the auras. They reflect mood, physical and mental health, and even psychic abilities. Auras are not permanent. They change depending on many factors. Being conscious of your own aura is key in developing your own psychic abilities.\n\u00a0\nThe seven layers of the aura hold different forms of information. These layers correspond to the seven\u00a0chakras. The energies from the chakras produce the auras. Physical, emotional and spiritual health effect the size of the aura. The aura layers expand and contract depending on those factors.\n\ufffc\nThe best way to begin learning to interpret people\u2019s auras is to become aware of how you are physically affected when you are near them. This is known as\u00a0clairsentiense. Take a deep breath, and as you exhale, take notice of your five senses and your gut reaction. Think about how you are feeling. Are you anxious? Do you want to be near this person? Do you feel relaxed or happy to be with this individual? Does this person make your skin crawl? Try hard not to focus on the verbal conversation that took place. Instead, try to think about what color you would attach to this person. As your abilities are enhanced, feeling, sensing and seeing the aura colors become easier.\n\u00a0\nA good suggestion is to keep a journal of your thoughts and experiences after encountering other people. After meeting someone, write down what appeared in your mind or any color you associated with that person. You might later find out something about the life or past experiences of the individual you had met.\n\u00a0\nTo understand how your aura is projected from your body, there is a simple exercise that can be done. Take your palms and rub them together rapidly. Pull them apart and repeat the rubbing. Next, slowly pull them apart again, but hold them approximately one inch apart. Close your eyes and focus on the sensation happening between your hands. Is there warmth? Does it feel like they are opposing magnets? Is there a slight trembling feeling?\n\u00a0\nYour sensations are not solely the result of friction. It is how your energy is emitting from your body. Also by doing this, you have stimulated the\u00a0chakras in the palms\u00a0of your hands, which are important for receiving and projecting healing energies. Focus on this energy field and you will experience several different vibrations and temperatures. These fluctuations represent information about you. All over your body, from head to toe, vibrations are released. An example of how to extend your auric field would be to open up your palms and turn them upward.\n\u00a0\nMany exercises and techniques, such as meditation, are available to fine-tune your ability to sense and see auras. The process can be slow, so be patient. If you do not see the colors, that is okay. Just focus on the feelings and sensations you are getting when you are around other people. You are on your way to further developing your psychic abilities.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71550, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Sensing Auras", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4n5nu/sensing_auras/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "spiritualmotivation1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4rj50t4b", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575231845, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4n361/everything_is_possible_abraham_hicks_2020_loa/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e4n361", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e4n361/everything_is_possible_abraham_hicks_2020_loa/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575231846, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71547, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE - Abraham Hicks 2020 (LOA)", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4n361/everything_is_possible_abraham_hicks_2020_loa/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AlanMasa", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3y1t36pz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575231366, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4myq5/nature_mysticism/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e4myq5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e4myq5/nature_mysticism/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575231366, "score": 1, "selftext": "I am not a spiritualist, but I thought that this may be interesting to some of the users here!

But when Sirius said this, I understood, and I was just so hopeful. \u2764\u2764", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71520, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Quote from Sirius Black hits home with me", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4kv8t/quote_from_sirius_black_hits_home_with_me/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AguirreTWoR", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1tn843mv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575220822, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4kb5u/seeing_repitive_numbers_other_than_1111/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e4kb5u", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e4kb5u/seeing_repitive_numbers_other_than_1111/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575220823, "score": 1, "selftext": "Ever since I got back into the habit of medition a couple of months ago, I started noticing numbers like 11:11 12:12, 13:13, etc a lot.

I have started writing another book entitled, \"This Book Is a Game\". And since then, I have been liberated. I had just recently made a new friend and she thought me possibly the Messiah. Then she didn't like some true things that I said and got really upset with me. As the warm person that I am, I could care less and told her to be on her way. She then said many cruel things to me in which I will not share. Shortly after, one of my friends made a pro-vaccine post. After some arguing, it ended with him telling me this, and I quote: \"Most of your ideas are deluded at best and deranged at worst\". Does this sound to you like a friend's remarks? God is amazing. God finds ways of revealing people's true self. This statement was a clear indication that this individual is someone whom I should stay away from. Yet it was the end remark of a twenty year relationship. Choose your friends wisely. For they might think this under their breath. And it might take you great toils to push it from their lips. But in the end, you are better off without someone like this. He was never a resource but instead a burden. And it just took the right situation to arise to extract his secret feelings about you. People like this are your anchor: for all they can do is slow you down.\n\nI spend my life trying to connect with and help those who are in need. I try very hard to effectively utilise the gifts that God has bestowed upon me to help those who are disadvantaged within our world. But society has always stopped me from doing this, whether they censor me or lock me up in a prison or mental institution. Every time I get close to reaching a lot of people, I am shut down by not only lay people in society but also the authorities. I have a perfect record because I have spent my entire life trying to be a good boy. But I spent my whole life being a rebellious good boy. So even though my record is spotless, it is absolutely huge. Because I fought for those who are disadvantaged in this world not only on the Internet, but also the streets. My reception is never warmly welcomed. But people don't understand that I am not writing or making videos to the general public, but instead, the few who can see through this smokescreen that I have created. My words are not at what they first appear. They are an autostereogram. Its first impression is flat but the funny thing is that NPCs can't see in 3D. However, some skilled players have the ability to look at background conditions if they stare at the words long enough.\n\nI am going to tell you the biggest truth in the world. I promise you that what I am about to share with you is the truth. If you are to be successful in what I am presenting, you need to believe wholeheartedly that this is the truth. I have just started writing my fifth book. Its title is, \"This Book is a Game\". And the title accurately reflects its content and possibilities with that content. You are in a game. God has created this game. You are a player of this game. The world is designed to stop you from realising this. Only Satan's followers get a free pass to fame. You, however, have to earn it. You have to figure out how to avoid the numerous traps set before you. You need to solve the puzzles so you can get one step closer to your goal: to save the world from faulty forms of artificial intelligence. And I am telling you the truth. God deliberately created mass loads of AI to give the player a main quest line: save the world by repairing faulty AI in the world. You are an AI repairman and you have a lot of work ahead of you. But here is the thing: not every faulty circuit board can be fixed. Some have sustained too much damage. Some we will need to dispose of if we are unable to create a fix.\n\nPeople who are just handed fame never know how to most effectively utilise that fame. I don't really want to be famous. However and unfortunately, the mission that God has given me requires me to get noticed in order to pass on the invaluable information in which I have to share.\n\nTo end this chapter I will refer back to the beginning. Because these were individuals who were ready to cash in on a new game idea of mine yet were not prepared to run the miles in order to get said game off of the ground. There will be many who wish to ride on your back. Who is worthy? Who is worthy of receiving fame and honour from your toils? Who should you involve within your life? Who should you make friends with? Who are your enemies and how can you identify them? What trials and tribulations shall you craft in order to streamline the most valuable players into play? If someone is capable of saying something then you should setup the required circumstances in which they could say that thing. If they do not say that thing then it could be possible that you have found yourself a true allie. However, I warn you, they always say the evil thing. There has been no situation in which I have setup to allow the person to say the thing in which they have not said the thing. However, I still go through this process to give the person a chance to say a different thing. My heart yearns for them to say a different thing. A thing of compassion and love. That thing that exists somewhere in your heart. I am trying my best to pull it out of you.\n\nhttp://nesmith.net/atheden", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71487, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Fallout", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4itxc/the_fallout/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Harinim96", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_35g3odft", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575208538, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4hpvh/my_inner_child_is_scared_of_my_mother/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e4hpvh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e4hpvh/my_inner_child_is_scared_of_my_mother/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575208539, "score": 1, "selftext": "This might sound a bit crazy.

It has become a demon that I can no longer feed or protect. It has cost me so much pain and anguish and yet I hold on to it and make the necessary adjustments as it grows and gets more and more difficult to hide. Today, I surrender. Today I give it to my creator because it has become too heavy a burden and I am unable to carry it any longer. What I am about to do is both terrifying and liberating and I'm afraid. I've spent every day for a year and a half pretending to be someone I'm not but today...that has to change. Today, I choose to live as my authentic self. Today, I stand before God and each and every one of you and ask that you take a moment to send me light and love because I fear it will take all of your love to get me through this.\n\nLet me begin by telling you a little bit about myself.  I'm between 40 and 50 years old and I'm a nurse. I have 2 adult children that are absolutely wonderful. Sounds like I have it all together, right? I've become an expert and putting that mask on every morning. The mask with the smile and outgoing attitude fits me well. In all honesty, I am broken and I am lost. I have a hard time with emotions. I feel them deeper than anyone I know except for maybe my youngest daughter...she feels like I do. I am not a surface person...I need depth in relationships but the problem is that most people feel uncomfortable with depth...it's quite disappointing. I learned early on in life that I was different than most. I remember seeing a mitten in the street when I was a kid and it was in a puddle and it was raining...I cried for the mitten because it was alone and I just knew that it was cold and lonely. I was about 5 or 6 but maybe that will show you how deep I can get with my feels now imagine being 17 years old and your first boyfriend ever cheats on you and gets another girl pregnant...that kind of pain was too much for me to handle. I came to find out that they made something just for that kind of pain...those pretty white lines made everything go away and I could function again. That shit took everything away... and I do mean everything. I got clean at 27 and I had lost my mind, my dignity, and myself...I lost myself. God must have answered my mother's prayers because I found myself on a detox unit and then did an entire year of residencial treatmemt. I came out of that like a super hero. I went to nursing school after completing rehab and had the world by it's proverbial balls. I was a force to be reckoned with...I chewed problems up and spit em out because I knew I was a bad bitch. \n\nWell...now I must take the power out of my secret and just say it...I've been using drugs again for the past year and a half and I can't believe I just said that...ugh. I'm stuck and I'm a real addict...not the kind that uses in moderation...no...the kind that uses all day every day. If my job was to find out I would lose not only my job but they would call the licensing board and report me...BOOM...carrer over. If my kids found out they would be so sad. They would be disappointed and lose trust in me. They would never trust me again and I'm all they have. It's come really close a few times but I was able to keep it hidden . I found Reddit about 8 or 9 months ago when I was looking for legal advice. I just so happened to run across the psychic genre and eventually it led me to the Spirituality and Awakened subreddits. I can't get enough. I have had several reading and learned a lot about myself. Turns out I'm an Empath and that's where all my emotions come into play. I have a gay daughter and it was so nice to be a part of a community that loved God and my daughter at the same time without having anyone tell me she wasn't going to heaven or that God loves the sinner but hates the sin... ugh. They just loved. I've always had this dream to open a home or facility to house the LGBTQ youth that are disowned by their parents and on the streets and show them that God does love them and they are beautiful and important. Well, I had a few psychics tell me about my ambitions and telle that it's my souls purpose. How the fuck do I get there if I don't transcend? How do I do God's work if I am in this situation. I can meditate and pray but how do I expect to grow when this is a huge blockage that needs to be handled first. How do I grow and attract higher vibrational stuff if I am stuck in a low vibrational life? It's time to take action...I will be letting go of the old to make room for the new. I just ended a toxic relationship 2 months ago in preparation for my leveling up but I have not addressed my addiction for fear of losing my best friend. Meth made everything better (so I thought) for a portion of my life when needing to escape feelings but I haven't forgotten that it takes everything away eventually. I have made a decision to release this burden on the next full moon to close this cycle and finally have my new beginning. I believe in the power of the Holy Spirit and I know that I will come out of this victorious. I have kids to help out there and love to give them and a building to acquire...I have no idea how but it's going to happen. I ask something of each and every one of you tonight...keep me in your prayers and ask you people to pray for me and please send me your light and love every time you remember because I have a feeling that it's gunna take a village on this one. On December 11th I will be prepared to toss it all out and begin my journey to enlightenment and my journey to prepare a place where God's forgotten angels can find peace and love. I plan to make a little ritual where I can offer it up to God because I can't do it anymore. At midnight on the 12th I will have released mynl torment. If anyone knows a nice ritual symbolic of complete surrender to Spirit please message me. I welcome your words of encouragement and ask that you continually hold me up in prayer. This is gunna be interesting to say the least...bye for now my people and Know that I love you all. Thank you for listening.

I read things like \u201cSpiritualism is damaged by this. It will be much more difficult now.\u201d\n\nWhat I would like to ask those who write these headlines, as well as those who agree with them, is what they think about when they say spiritualism?\n\nFor me, spirituality is a journey of exploring myself and coming to know myself. I then share the self I have discovered with people who want to listen. Those who wish can learn from my experience and incorporate it into their own lives, or they can simply tell me to get lost.\n\nSpirituality is the effort to know oneself, and it\u2019s been going on since the first humans. It\u2019s always been there, even before the oldest person alive today, and it will always be here long after we are all dead. It is a person\u2019s own inner journey. If you think of spirituality as a brand or a commodity, and if you think negative news hurts it, then you may well be having some difficulty understanding the nature of this issue.\n\nLouise Hay said something very inspirational about the subject: \u201cI\u2019m not trying to sell anything or convince people about something. I talk about my own path, anyone who wishes can benefit from it, as they like.\u201d The journey of knowing yourself is like this\u2014you discover and you share. You are not trying to convince anyone about anything, nor should you try to do so. Spirituality is not a religion that requires missionaries to go out and spread the word. It is every person\u2019s individual journey. Whatever you do, you do it for yourself. Sure, you can benefit from hearing about other people\u2019s journeys. You can also read books, meditate, or even just make fun of it all. Maybe you can find yourself through ways that no one else has even dreamed of yet.\n\nThis is an important point. We assume that reaching the \u201ctruth\u201d can only be achieved by following a certain path, and there is no other way. There are as many paths as there are people living on this planet. Some may have wavered from their path or taken a break from it, but it\u2019s not for us to put them back on it. If a person wants to be inspired, he or she will ask you for it. When I think about my own guides, none of them ever came to me saying, \u201cCome on! I\u2019ll teach you this and that.\u201d I saw the light in them and ran after them, asking them to teach me about the source of their light\u2026\n\nOne thing leads to another, but I\u2019d like to talk about when people say, \u201cPut aside spirituality and come to the real world.\u201d I have even heard many \u201cspiritual\u201d guides say this. If you think you can separate the world into its spiritual and \u201creal\u201d dimensions, though, you may be missing the gist of it. Everything is \u201cspiritual.\u201d Spiritual means the inner, the soul, and everything is about the soul. Point to anything in this world and you\u2019re pointing to its soul. To express it more scientifically, we can say energy instead of soul. You cannot talk about how an individual creates its own reality and then turn around and say, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s now put spirituality aside.\u201d You simply can\u2019t! Sure, you can gossip, work, and hang out with the greatest scientific minds, but you should do it knowing that it is all a part of the soul. Spirituality is the journey itself. The distinction between the worldly and the spiritual exists only in our minds. They are one in the same. I have seen \u201cworldly\u201d people who are deeper than the most \u201cspiritual,\u201d and I have seen \u201cspiritual\u201d people with a better grasp of reality than the most \u201cworldly.\u201d\n\nIn short, spirituality can never be damaged, harmed, or broken, and it will never become outdated. For as long as people exist, this journey will always be available to them to unburden their hearts.\n\nThis river will always flow\u2026  \n\n\nHasan Sonsuz Celiktas  \n[www.thewisemag.com](https://www.thewisemag.com)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71450, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can Spirituality Get Damaged?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4fwia/can_spirituality_get_damaged/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "saiglai", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_nm95j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575196973, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4fr2e/what_kind_of_proofs_there_are_about_jesus/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e4fr2e", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e4fr2e/what_kind_of_proofs_there_are_about_jesus/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575196974, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71449, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What kind of proofs there are about Jesus reincarnations and what you can tell about topic", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4fr2e/what_kind_of_proofs_there_are_about_jesus/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Nicholas-D-Arezzo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2sj1ny87", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575194475, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4f945/like_attracts_like_whether_you_appreciate/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e4f945", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e4f945/like_attracts_like_whether_you_appreciate/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575194481, "score": 1, "selftext": "I would like you to be aware that appreciation is the alpha and omega of a rewarding manifestation. If the process of manifestation were a bracelet, the clasps that hold it together would be \u201cappreciation.\u201d Simply put, what you appreciate is what you build on, and what you don't appreciate degrades. It's the start and the finish. If you appreciate what you attract and experience, then your starting point for what you attract in the future will start at that higher foundation of appreciation and grow into something bigger and better. If you decide not to deliberately manifest and only appreciate what you have, you will still build on your previous appreciation. From your previous appreciation, you will draw in more rewarding experiences from the new platforms you manifest from.\n\nBesides having an overall appreciation in life, there is one form of appreciation that is still imperative for success, and this includes manifestation success. What I'm talking about is self-appreciation. There is an essential rule for your appreciation to be felt and appreciated by others, and that is to appreciate yourself first. Let's say a person who doesn't take care of himself shows contempt for you and has no problem telling you he doesn't like you. It's evident by his lack of hygiene and poor posture that he doesn't appreciate or even respect himself. Would you lose much sleep knowing this individual doesn't like you? You most likely wouldn\u2019t. You would probably want him to go away and stay away. If that person showed admiration for you, would you want to include a person like this in your circle of friends? Probably not. So remember, people like to have admiration and respect, but from people who appreciate and respect themselves first.\n\nTherefore, the ultimate question of self-appreciation is, \u201cAm I someone whom I would like to meet and get to know?\u201d The answer needs to be a solid yes. The reason is, you and only you will ever be and could ever be the foundation that will support your desires, and worthwhile manifestations rely on a healthy self-esteem. Think of your self-esteem as the plaster and the manifested desires as the pretty, shiny wallpaper you wish to put on the plaster. If the plaster is gritty, you may get the wallpaper on for a moment, only to soon watch it fall off the wall. In other words, attraction isn't like selling an item on a classified ad after you discovered a piece of junk you don't want is a highly coveted antique. According to the law of attraction, if you think you are junk then so will everyone else.\n\nPoint being is, how you see yourself is how others will see you. Also, like attracts like. If you don't think highly of yourself then you will be surrounded by people who don't respect you. You can still attract abundance but it most likely won't last if you are dissatisfied with the co-creators who are making it possible for you. For example, let\u2019s say someone lands a job that is a dream come true for this person. The job is very exciting and lucrative. Also, the job requires work-hours that are perfect for this person. However, this person is disregarded by all the people he/she works with. Because of this, the actual work experience gradually becomes more of a nightmare than a dream, as the days progress. This, in turn, will be the reason this person eventually abandons their \u201cdream job,\u201d or gets fired.\n\nWhy did this happen? It happened because this person lacks self-worth. This person put gorgeous wallpaper over old, crumbly plaster only to watch it slowly fall off the walls. That\u2019s a lot of invested time to accumulate trash; don't you think? Once you learn to appreciate who you are, that appreciation will grow towards self-esteem and self-respect. Self-appreciation, self-respect, and self-esteem need to be a part of your life if you ever want to manifest worthwhile experiences that will last. The main reason being is, like attracts like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~Nicholas D\u2019Arezzo\\~", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71442, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Like Attracts Like, Whether You Appreciate Yourself Or Not", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4f945/like_attracts_like_whether_you_appreciate/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "austinread6", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_40lzd10t", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575193790, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e4f3rq/5_signs_youre_about_to_attract_a_soulmate/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e4f3rq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e4f3rq/5_signs_youre_about_to_attract_a_soulmate/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575193791, "score": 1, "selftext": " The spiritual journey can be quite lonely.

I started having this very lucid dreams where everything felt super real and I kept on waking up during 3 AM - 3:33 AM. I woke up multiple times and always remembered everything that was happening. Fast forward a couple of years, the first time I tried Cocaine. Suddenly on coke, I had super weird deja vu feelings and I managed to remember that I dreamt this before. I got that deja vu feeling like 10 times in one day and so did couple of my friends, I even said to my friend: I dreamt this and he replied: I dreamt something that happened earlier. The next day my friend didn't remember anything that happened when he was on cocaine but I did. So fast forward a bit more I'm still having these moments when I realize something has already happened to me in my dreams. I really remember a lot of dreams and sometimes they don't make any sense but some moments simply happen in my actual life.   \n\n\nBut today tonight, at 3:03 AM I awoke from a terrible nightmare. Now I've been in a psychiatric ward before and I've seen people who come there and they don't remember their names, their dates of birth and are like empty vessels or just so broken to the point where they simply aren't as they were before. Now I have addictions problems and that's the reason I've been going to the ward but I also had a couple of enlightenment moments where I started realizing how this world is and that there are weird things happening to a lot of people, that there probably is some God (used to be an Athiest, changed my mind after all the mindfucks I've been through). I also had serious problems where I thought the devil was sending me messages through music (maybe drug-induced psychosis?), maybe it was the Universe (a.k.a. God in my mind), or some government organization and so on and on. I don't know where I'm at. Okay so, back to the nightmare. I was dreaming that I was with all my family, safe, nice environment and suddenly I forgot everything about who I was, my date of birth, how I look and so on. I was just sitting there listening to voice telling me I was actually born in 1917 or something like that, a weird name I have that I don't remember anymore what it was and some weird stories that I no longer recall. But in the dream, I grabbed a knife and started cutting into my arms but everyone just kept on laughing telling me, \"You can't run anymore!\". At that point, I grabbed the knife and started stabbing them, then I just saw the police sirens through the window and woke up. Basically I was scared shitless when I woke up and for about 2 to 4 minutes couldn't remember who I was.\n\n  \nThe previous day I was actually praying for some other person and for myself but not in a religious type of way if you understand what I mean. Like just talking to nothing  &amp; everything. I basically had a wish that I won't really talk about but it doesn't involve anything special other than that that I wanted to get one person I'm talking to on daily basis to get to live with me and that the Universe would help with some things.   \n\n\nThis might not make sense because as I'm reading this I honestly don't know what the fuck happened but it was a vivid experience I was truly afraid of losing my body. It was like a dying and being reborn experience but I was too afraid in my dreams to go through with it.

Although He is present in His abode, He is all-pervading, and everything is situated within Him.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nIt is here clearly stated that the supreme destination from which there is no return is the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Person. The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 describes this supreme abode as \u0101nanda-cinmaya-rasa, a place where everything is full of spiritual bliss. Whatever variegatedness is manifest there is all of the quality of spiritual bliss-there is nothing material. All variegatedness is expanded as the spiritual expansion of the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the manifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter Seven. As far as this material world is concerned, although the Lord is always in His supreme abode, He is nonetheless all-pervading by His material energy. So by His spiritual and material energies He is present everywhere-both in the material and in the spiritual universes. Yasy\u0101nta\u1e25sth\u0101ni means that everything is sustained by Him, whether it be spiritual or material energy.\n\nIt is clearly stated here that only by bhakti, or devotional service, can one enter into the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha (spiritual) planetary system. In all the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas there is only one Supreme Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who has expanded Himself into millions and millions of plenary expansions. These plenary expansions are four-armed, and they preside over the innumerable spiritual planets. They are known by a variety of names-Puru\u1e63ottama, Trivikrama, Ke\u015bava, M\u0101dhava, Aniruddha, H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pradyumna, \u015ar\u012bdhara, V\u0101sudeva, D\u0101modara, Jan\u0101rdana, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, V\u0101mana, Padman\u0101bha, etc. These plenary expansions are likened unto the leaves of a tree, and the main tree is likened to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, dwelling in Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, His supreme abode, systematically conducts all affairs of both universes (material and spiritual) without a flaw by power of His all-pervasiveness.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the only way to enter the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha (spiritual) planetary system ?

Beyond this materialistic world you are something significant and you should realize that in any case. What I\u2019ve learned through the past 5 years in my spiritual journey is that we as individuals are greatly important and we need to realize this. \n\nOur souls are in fact the same and it originates from the divine universe itself. For me I have drifted away from the belief that God is a separate deity that is different from all of us. But then I\u2019ve come to realize that God is the universe itself. Each and everyone of us have God in us and it is the soul. So recognizing your importance with the divine in you is the goal of life. \n\nWhen you develop self-recognition and detachment from the material world then you are discovering God. When a person destroys the ego and the sense of self that we all have then they are left with divine consciousness. This for me is my ultimate spiritual goal that is beyond any other. One of the worst things about being born is that we are surrounded by an infinite amount of materialism. Materialism is the root of every suffering known to all creatures on in this universe. \n\nOnce we are born with this overwhelming amount of materialism, then we are left with a constant urge for stimulation. We become so drained because we are constantly looking for any form of stimulation that we can find. That\u2019s why spiritual masters such as the Buddha became enlightened. He cut out any form of materialism and sense stimulation. That\u2019s why he became an enlightened being, his mind was shifted into God consciousness instead of materialistic consciousness.\n\nEnlightenment boils down to God consciousness. When a person obtains God consciousness then there are no need for any materialism or stimulation. You obtain your true nature which is God, and every soul is God including yours. That\u2019s the beauty of this, any person can reach this enlightenment because we have God within us and that is the soul.

Seek Truth even if it\u2019s uncomfortable., not pleasure.\n\nIf you believe in the false concept of reincarnation please watch this: https://youtu.be/sdycNkOZliQ\n\nIn the three most philosophically important categories of epistemology (how we know things), we see that without God we cannot make sense of rationality, our existence, or morality. It makes more sense to say that God is the author of the laws of logic upon which rationality is built. It makes more sense to say that we came into existence by a decision of a supreme being. Finally, it makes more sense to say that absolute morals require an absolute mind.\nSo, is there a God? Absolutely, because without Him we can't make sense of anything.\n\nI\u2019d love to share this with you, please this is very important. GOOD NEWS.                  \n\nSummary just Incase if you did not want to read it all. a message out of love. Before getting to the good news and bad news, lets cover a few things up. When we look around we see intelligent design, when we look at us we have objective morality (we know right and wrong) and a conscience, God has revealed Himself clearly to us through Creation and through His Word \"The Bible is a reliable collection of historical documents written by eyewitnesses during the lifetime of other eyewitnesses which report supernatural events in fulfillment of specific prophecies claiming that they are words of divine origin, rather than human in origin.\" God is Holy and in His justice, and because we've sinned against God (ask yourself, have you ever told a lie? Have you ever stolen anything despite its value? Have you ever blasphemed the name of the Lord like saying OMG, have you ever looked with just which is committing adultery in the heart, have you ever hated someone?) He must condemn guilty sinners to Hell. But, God doesn\u2019t want any to perish, but God is Just and can\u2019t just forgive guilty sinners, so God in His love and mercy sent His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, which is God manifested in the flesh, God crushed and slaughtered Christ under the wrath of God and judgement we deserved, then Jesus suffered and died for His people\u2019s sins, was buried and rose again offering salvation to all that repent (turn away from sins) and trust in what He has done. Understand that God is Holy, Just and Perfect and righteous, and we are sinners, who broke His Commandments, but that God provided the Savior. Romans 6:23 says, \u201cFor the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d believe in the Lord Jesus Christ we are saved by grace through faith in His blood.\nWhen we repent of our sins and trust fully in the Saviour to rescue us from our own sinfulness, we become new creations! \u201cThe old has gone, the new has come\u201d (2 Corinthians 5:17)! Along with inheriting our new identity as a Christian, a child of God, an ambassador for the Lord, we are assured a place in Heaven and gain the desire and power to battle sin. Whereas before, we were held captive to sin, utterly powerless and given zero reason even to fight against it, now, we are slaves to Christ and His righteousness (Romans 6:18). This is where true freedom begins!\n\nUnfortunately we live in a corrupt society that intuitively knows God exists (through intelligent design, order, conscience, objective morality, sense of justice) but suppress the truth in unrighteousness, people tend to not like what goes against their pleasures unfortunately. Despite all the evidence (24,000 manuscripts, 9 ancient sources, 500+ eyewitnesses, historical scholars and professors know this to be true as well, above all the word of God) of the Lord Jesus Christ death burial and resurrection for the forgiveness of sins by repentance and faith, would you rather live a lifestyle of sin and be condemned or receive eternal life God offers as a gift by His amazing grace through the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nRepentance is to reject your old sinful ways of living and make a 180-turn towards God and His good, righteous character/statutes. It means we feel the weight of our guilt before God and respond by sincerely apologizing for our wickedness, thanking Him for His pardon through the blood of Jesus, and living the rest of our lives to please Him \u2014 and Him alone. Trusting alone in Christ knowing no amount of good deeds can save you, and following Him loving the Lord thy God being obedient, faithful and enduring till the end. There will be trials and tribulations, but it is for our benefit! Humble yourself. Quit being prideful, relying upon your own good deeds to get you through. Please, there is nothing more important than your eternal Salvation, this isn't some fairytale, it's rather True or it isn't. It\u2019s rather Christ is Risen and we can be justified through faith in His blood, or not. We are not just a body of matter that exploded from nothing, please think about this.\n\nThis view [that Jesus didn\u2019t exist] is demonstrably false. It is fuelled by a regrettable form of atheist prejudice, which holds all the main primary sources, and Christian people, in contempt. \u2026. Most of its proponents are also extraordinarily incompetent.\n\nMaurice Casey, Nottingham University, in Jesus of Nazareth\n\nToday, nearly all historians, whether Christians or not, accept that Jesus existed and that the gospels contain plenty of valuable evidence which has to be weighed and assessed critically.\n\nThe late Graham Stanton, Cambridge University, in The Gospels and Jesus\n\nBiblical scholars and classical historians now regard it [the theory that Jesus didn\u2019t exist] as effectively refuted.\n\nRobert Van Voorst, Western Theological Seminary, in Jesus outside the New Testament\n\nI do not have to provide you evidence because you know God exists but suppress the truth in unrighteousness, it is not a truth problem, it\u2019s a heart problem, people don\u2019t want there to be a God because there love for sin and pleasures are more than being righteous.\n\nWell, people tend to not like what goes against there pleasures unfortunately, a main reason why people suppress the existence of God, nothing can not create space matter nor time, and also they believe there is no such thing as good or evil nor objective truth, our conscience says otherwise. \n\nThe Bible is a reliable collection of historical documents written by eyewitnesses during the lifetime of other eyewitnesses which report supernatural events in fulfillment of specific prophecies claiming that they are words of divine origin, rather than human in origin.\"    derived from 2 Peter 1:16-21\n\nC.S. Lewis on Reasoning to Atheism\n\n\u200e\u201dSupposing there was no intelligence behind the universe, no creative mind. In that case, nobody designed my brain for the purpose of thinking. It is merely that when the atoms inside my skull happen, for physical or chemical reasons, to arrange themselves in a certain way, this gives me, as a by-product, the sensation I call thought. But, if so, how can I trust my own thinking to be true? It\u2019s like upsetting a milk jug and hoping that the way it splashes itself will give you a map of London. But if I can\u2019t trust my own thinking, of course I can\u2019t trust the arguments leading to Atheism, and therefore have no reason to be an Atheist, or anything else. Unless I believe in God, I cannot believe in thought: so I can never use thought to disbelieve in God.\u201d\n\n\u2014C.S.

These are also called unitary experiences, numinous experiences, visionary or shamanic experiences, etc. \n\nI think these flow from a pure experience of awareness as such, even Being as such.\n\nMystical experiences reveal that \"you\", and everything you think you know, exist only from a highly specific perspective that's fine-tuned to navigate our little corner of the solar system, and are utterly insignificant from a broader one. \nThere is an identical thread, numerically one, running throughout everything simultaneously, which we can't see with unaided eyes.\nIT is your car.\nIT is your co-worker.\nIT is the sky.\nThe only thing that exists in itself, as a true unified \"something\", is Existence itself.  All modifications, all \u201ckinds\u201d of being, exist not only as contingent on the environment, but also relative to a certain perspective. \n\nThere are perspectives from which the distinction between you and the chair upon which you sit doesn\u2019t exist in any recognizable form. \n\nAll differences between me, you, this computer, the sky and tress, are merely the construction of a certain subjective perspective that simultaneously shields is from directly perceiving the All.\nIt sounds absurd, because it is quite literally unthinkable; the implication is that **distinction** itself is part of the illusion. The mind's ability to distinguish between \"this\" and \"that\" is merely a filter which shields us from the Numimous, the Beatific Vision, the complete vision of Existence as such, the Unity. \nJust as we have evolved to see a specific range of colors out of the much larger scale of possible detectable photons which remain completely invisible to our naked eye - so too have we evolved to reduce all things to \"this\" as opposed to \"that\", just as we see black vs. white, out of much larger possible scale of what might constitute modes of existence. \nHere, \"subject\" and \"object\", \"this\" and \"that\", evaporate away because everything has IT in common. What do you have left when all distinction is take away? Being. Existence. Pure \"is-ness\". \nWe have exceeded the limitations of language here. We are bending grammar itself, and consequently logic. How can one even express this experience, without using any conceptual distinctions? There must be some distinction at least in the mind for language and thought to be possible. And if there is any distinction in the mind, then we are not thinking of IT.\nWe are bumping up against something literally inexpressible. \"IS\". \"IT\". \"BEING\". \n\nThese words are as close as we can come, but even here we fall short since we immediately distinguish ourselves from the thought which contains these concepts. \nDescartes made this clear: we cannot help but see a distinction between the thinker and the thought.\nTo speak of it, to think of it, is to immediately diminish IT.\n\"The Tao that can be spoken is not the Tao.\"\n\nMystical experiences are an evolutionary adaption, or the vestiges of some form of higher consciousness, that overcome reason itself. They allow for experience of the actual transcendent, the mystical, that which lies beyond the grasp of reason. \n\nThe koans of Buddhism serve the same purpose  (what is the sound of one hand clapping?), along with the Trinity of Christianity (Three is One). \n\n*Reason itself is the filter.*\n\nMysticism is that which pushes experience past individuality into communal identity, Universal Oneness.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71392, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Some thoughts on mystical experiences", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e49zfq/some_thoughts_on_mystical_experiences/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "S_DW", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4fg3g9g9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575171306, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e49ke1/cloud_atlas/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e49ke1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Reincarnation/Past Life"}], "link_flair_template_id": "2452619c-ceef-11e9-8022-0e5fd19a5044", "link_flair_text": "Reincarnation/Past Life", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e49ke1/cloud_atlas/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575171307, "score": 1, "selftext": "Have you ever seen this movie?

I don\u2019t even know what. \n\nThis past summer, I went to NV to visit one of my friends that I hadn\u2019t seen in YEARS. He had 2 friends staying with him and one of them was this girl that was couchsurfing/traveling the country. We all got along super well and the girl invited me to CA and so I went to visit her alone. We decided to go to Yosemite National Park and invited our 2 friends from NV to meet us there cause it was sort of a middle point. I told them that we need to set up a place to meet because our phones aren\u2019t going to work in the park. Mind you, none of us have been there before. So we picked the only place to get food inside the park to meet. I rented a car and drove my friend and I to Yosemite and obviously the phone stopped working immediately outside the park. We didn\u2019t have a camp spot yet so we definitely all needed to meet up since we didn\u2019t know where we were camping. Right before we enter the national park and the phones turned off, I decided to text the group chat and tell our friends we\u2019re gonna try and find a campsite right by the entrance cause we are already so late. That was the last message we sent. Then I asked the guy at the entrance what our chances were of finding a spot at our desired campground much deeper in the park and he said we might be able to! So I\u2019m like okay we should try. So we drive 2 hours in and now I\u2019m starting to be a little anxious about finding our friends because we didn\u2019t tell them we decided to go ahead and try the desired campspot anyway. We signed up on the waitlist cause we didn\u2019t find a spot and it was around 11 am. I knew that at this point our friends must be about an hour out from the East entrance of the park (we came from the west). We are told of another campground that might have a spot that is back towards the West entrance... so we leave a NOTE on a PIECE OF PAPER and put it on a bulletin board that we\u2019re going to try another camp site but to meet them back there at 2pm. Mind you there is like maybe a 2% chance they\u2019ll ever see this note it\u2019s so hidden. Then as we head out I see the food place we planned to meet at so we leave a note there too. Right before we left I asked the guy working at the food place where there is wifi. He says phone service starts working 20 miles east of the park. So I\u2019m like okay you know what, screw the other camp site, we need to meet up with our friends so we need to get a message to them before they lose cellphone service. So I HAUL ASS towards the East exit/entrance of the park that they are coming in towards. I\u2019m looking on the road for their car coming the other direction cause I know they are going to be entering the park literally any moment and they are going to drive straight to where i said I was going to find a camp spot towards the West Entrance. I don\u2019t see them and right outside the park before we get to the town that has cell service, my friend\u2019s phone starts getting MESSAGES!!! So she tells me and I immediately swerve right and we stop at a gas station. I park and I\u2019m like.... I have this really weird feeling that they are inside this gas station store. My friend was like no way... why would they be in the store? So I get out of the car, I walk into the crowded store and I SEE MY TWO FRIENDS IN LINE!!!

So, I wanted to share a few tips that I find helpful to work through the emotions whenever I'm dealing with them.\n\nIf you prefer videos:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch2MP7kUkf4&amp;t=101s\n\nIf you prefer reading:\n\n1. Accept the Emotion\n\nWe usually see a negative emotion as a bad thing or a weakness. But the emotion itself is a natural part of being human. All it is is a signal from our body that something isn\u2019t quite right and that we need to take action and work through it.\n\nBecause if we don\u2019t, then the negative emotion can completely take over and ruin our day.\n\nSo, we\u2019ve got to accept it, because when we can accept our emotion, then we\u2019re in a position to take action and work through it. And part of accepting our emotion means we acknowledge that it\u2019s there and we don\u2019t judge ourselves for it.\n\n2. Make a Choice\n\nFeeling frustrated is normal, but snapping at someone else..that\u2019s a choice. Feeling afraid is normal, but not doing something that you want to do is a choice. Feeling guilty is normal, but constantly thinking you\u2019re a bad person is a choice.\n\nSo, regardless of how we feel, we get to choose how we control our thoughts and actions. We can\u2019t control negative situations or what someone says or does to us. But.. we can be in charge of how we think\u2026 and what we do.\n\nSo, we can choose to attach to every negative thought that we have and let the negative emotion completely consume us. Or we can choose to problem solve through our feelings which leads us to the third tip and that is to\n\n3. Create an Action Plan \n\nBefore a negative emotion hits me, I like to be on the offense instead of defense. I want to be ready for when it happens, so I can problem solve through it immediately instead of letting my emotions control me.\n\nSo we have to remember that we usually have negative emotions that either rise up in the heat of the moment(like when your kids are arguing and you get instantly frustrated) or the emotions have been lingering for a while (like constantly feeling worthless at your job)\n\nSo creating an action plan can help you identify a few strategies to use BEFORE you find yourself in an emotional state. Before you start snapping at someone because you\u2019re angry. Before you start guilt tripping yourself about the past again. Before you talk yourself out of a job opportunity.\n\nHere are 8 examples you can use: \n\n1. Identify possible triggers. What is it that usually triggers your emotion? Is it when people aren\u2019t listening to you? Is it after you watch a movie? Is it when you hang out with certain friends? Identifying what sets you off helps you navigate around triggering experiences or it helps you to prevent them altogether. \n\n2. Put yourself in the other person\u2019s shoes. If someone makes you upset, instead of taking it as a personal attack, ask \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to this person to make them act that way?\u201d This helps you sympathize with the other person instead of getting instantly emotional. Like someone cutting you off in traffic. Maybe they\u2019re rushing to a family emergency or they have a passenger who is yelling at them or they\u2019re late for a major interview because they had a flat tire earlier. \n\n3. Breathe. Take a breath and say to yourself \u201cI\u2019m not going to let this emotion get the best of me.\u201d This is going to wake up the decision making part of your brain, so that you can start to gain control. \n\n4. Start counting. Think nothing but the numbers. Make a goal to count to 10. If you have a lot of emotion try counting to 100 instead. You\u2019ll notice as you continue to count, your heart rate will start to slow down a bit, and it gives you time to gather your thoughts before taking action. \n\n5. Communicate. If someone has upset you, setting a time to communicate with them is one of the best ways to resolve any kind of issues that are causing your negative emotions.\n\n6. Call friends and family. When you have a support group around you, it helps you to feel less alone when you\u2019re feeling emotional. \n\n7. Eat Healthy foods and Exercise. This is one we hear all the time. Numerous studies show eating right and exercising elevates your mood and reduces stress. \n\n8. Retrain your brain to think positive thoughts, so you\u2019re not attaching to every negative thought that comes your way.\n\nNow all of these strategies aren\u2019t going to fit into every kind of scenario. Some are going to be more effective than others in different kinds of situations. You have to find what works best for you.

This one was channeled in 1974. Yes, it's not the most recent channeling, but I thought some people here might find this information useful or, at the very least, interesting.\n\nAlso, as always, take everything with a grain of salt. This isn't a \"supreme authority\" of any kind. You can use this information as you wish, after all.\n\nThe alleged channeled entity is a social memory complex (\"soul group?\") from fifth density.\n\n-  -  -\n\nI am Latui. I am with this instrument. I greet you, my friends, in the love and the light of our infinite Creator. It is a very great privilege to be with you, my friends, for I have not been with you before. I have been with this instrument before but not with you, in a sense that I have not spoken with you. We, of course, cannot be separated in our totality.\n\nI am Latui. We of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator are always privileged to speak with the people of your planet. We are sorry that we have to use this method, but the reason for this method has been adequately explained by my brother. I will, therefore, continue using this instrument to give you certain thoughts, which I truly hope will help you in your seeking.\n\nThis planet, my friends, is a ball in space. It is a ball of light. But it does not appear to you as what it really is. The reason, my friends, that it is a ball of light is that all things in the entire creation are comprised of nothing but light. This is the basic building block of all of the material creation. When we greet you in His love and His light, we greet you in the only existing ingredients of the creation: love, the formative force, and light, the building block.\n\nI am aware that it is difficult for you to conceive of light as matter, but this, my friends, is the actual situation. Light is one of the two things that we always mention at the beginning of a contact. There is a good reason for this. There is a good reason for us to greet you in His love and His light. The reason is that this encompasses everything. And that is what we wish to do: include within this greeting everything and everyone in the creation. For, as we have told you, it is true that all of these parts are one single thing. Imagine, if you can, an infinitely large sphere of pure light. Impressed upon this is absolute love. Out of this, then, condenses the unimaginably vast number of created parts, each of those parts connected by this original force, the love of our infinite Creator. Each of us, my friends, and everything else, is made up of this single fabric\u2014light.\n\nIt is only necessary to learn the truth of what I say in its totality to be able to return to that place and stature that was designed for you by the Creator. Light, my friends, is the substance of which you are made. Light is the substance of which I am made. Light is the substance of which everything is. Love is the substance which forms light into the forms that you know as living beings, as planets, as trees, as stars, as air. It is all one substance. This substance, my friends, can be affected only by love.\n\nLove, my friends, is not what you think it is. The word in your language has a meaning that has various interpretations. But it is none of these things. We use the word when we speak to you, because it is as close as we can come to the concept, using your language. Love, my friends, is that force which does all of the things that are done in the entire creation. All of the things, my friends, even those that you would interpret as being without love. If it were not for that love, my friends, then the freedom of choice to do these things could not exist. It is only necessary that the individual realize the truth of what I am saying in order to be able to do those things that he was originally intended to be able to do by the Creator of us all.\n\nThe things that he was intended to be able to do are quite surprising. They extend so far beyond your present limitations that I could not possibly convey to you the scope and magnitude of these abilities. However, it is possible, let me assure you, through proper methods of advancing your understanding with respect to its present limitations, to regain what is rightfully yours, the knowledge that you have buried within you, the knowledge of the use of our Creator\u2019s light through love.\n\nIt is very, very important, my friends, that you seek an understanding of love. Do not be satisfied with your first interpretation of this concept, for it is much, much broader in scope than you might imagine. It covers everything that there is.\n\nI am going to instruct the people of your planet on the use of love. This will be done in an unusual way, but please bear with me. We have found that it is necessary to do things in unusual ways, as far as you are concerned. It is necessary to teach to you a way of thinking that is not common to the people of your planet, if you are to rapidly gain understanding of the concepts that are of utmost importance in your present progression. There are three ways to achieve a knowledge of love.\n\nThe first way is to relax, and let your mind become at rest. This is the method of meditation. If this is done, on a daily basis, then it is not possible to shut out the love that is ever present. You will become aware of the true creation and its meaning.\n\nThe second way is to go forth among the people of your planet and serve them. They will return to you love, and you will absorb this love and store it within your being. I must at this time caution that this service to your people must be done in such a way that it is service that they wish. Do not make a mistake, as so many of your people have done, in trying to impress an unwanted or unsolicited service upon your neighbor. To go forth and to serve your fellow man at this time upon your planet requires much care and planning, for it is at this time rather difficult to accomplish, for interpretations of service vary greatly, and it is necessary that you understand what service is, in order for yours to be effective. This can only be done by following the first step, or plan, which is meditation.\n\nThe third technique is to give all that you have to your fellow man. If this is done, then you will not be encumbered by material possessions. You will no longer give part of your love to material possessions. Giving love to material possessions is an extreme waste of your abilities. This is a mistake that is made by most of the people of this planet. It is necessary, if one is to attempt this method of gaining love, to divorce oneself from the desire for material things.\n\nEach one of these three avenues may be used. Each one will produce results. At present, it is very difficult to work and live within a society such as yours and to allow each of these programs for knowing love. It is therefore suggested by those of us of the Confederation of Planets in His Service that you employ the first method. Meditation. my friends, will allow you to decide to what extent you may employ the other two methods, for it is sometimes impractical to attempt to literally follow these two suggestions, in that those whom you attempt to serve will not understand. It is, however, recommended that you keep each of these methods in mind, for they are all important.\n\nMuch of the strife that has occurred upon your planet in its history is due to the attachment of the people of this planet for material possessions. They have a false concept, which is the concept of ownership of possessions. Everything is made of light. All of these possessions, everything that exists, is the property of our Creator. He provided ample materials for all people in all space. It is not necessary to covet any of these materials, for all of them are part of you. At present, there is much strife upon your planet. There is much coveting of properties, but this is of no avail to those who covet these properties, for even though they may acquire, as they think, these properties, their apparent possession is very, very short-lived.\n\nI am Latui. I hope that I have been of service.

The hard part is when all the feelings come back again, that's when I have to remember to never give up, I have to train my mind to stay positive because the more I think negative the more I'm gonna hurt myself and those around me and that would open more doors to a lot more sorrow.  I Have to stay strong, and I can't be sad or angry because those too will distract me from feeling free, because I am free, I am an eternal being hell bent on pushing my consciousness to the next level, and no matter where I am or what's happening I have faith in the One Creator who is all, who is I. For I am mind, I am One.  Surrounded by all these other exotic eternal beings of One with a Souls history, here to share information and Love with one another from world away, forever blending into a beautiful primordial creation of creations.  Everything is here for you, so what are you gonna create Creator?  Love?

friends why we shouldn\u2019t be friends anymore, it didn\u2019t work out well but it\u2019s progress. i let people walk over me a lot). i\u2019m trying to get rid of people who don\u2019t have good intentions. i\u2019ve never been spiritual and i was raised atheist which makes it hard but i\u2019m starting to believe a lot in energy and intentions and how much they can effect you. i want to find peace with my life and am sort of trying to get rid of the things that don\u2019t \u201cspark joy\u201d. trying to get the energy to clean and de clutter my room and a lot of aspects of my life. i\u2019m not at a point where i can have a lot of friends and treat them how they deserve and i think i really need to focus on myself. i want to become a better person. i\u2019m not sure if this is making any sense but i think i truly need to find peace in myself and understanding in the universe. i\u2019ve had adverse reactions to some spiritual ideals, although i know it\u2019s very different to everyone i had a psychotherapist tell me my sexual assault/rape was a life lesson and might be karma from a past life, i was experiencing intense suicidal thoughts and was supposed to be hospitalized that day and she told me that people who commit suicide go to a type of hell and then relieve their life over and over again. it broke me down and i was disgusted by that idea. that was a while ago and now i need to approach spirituality in a new way. i really need a purpose. recently i expressed to a friends mom that i was having a hard time and was feeling lots of negative energy around me and she gifted me sage palo santo and a few crystals (smokey quartz, obsidian, and tourmaline i believe). i have a fear of crystals because i\u2019m afraid of charging them with bad energy. i appreciated the gift so much and want to learn how to fully take care of them and not put negative energy into them. i also don\u2019t really know how to properly burn sage / palo santo and the sort of ritual and want to do it correctly. i don\u2019t know if this makes much sense. my therapist has recommended the book a new earth to me and i want to read that soon. i also want to start meditating again and try different meditations (mantras and things). if anyone has any advice or guidance i would appreciate it a lot. i\u2019ve been in a really really bad place and need to find some

I just, fucked up everything so bad, in my life. I have angels with me all the time, at least I think so. It's like I'm being guided, have been guided, but the last few months have been crazy, idk, I just kinda fucked up and then I didn't feel like doing it anymore. So I just gave up. Or something, and now I'm sitting on my dads couch and just ruining my life.\n\nI can feel like my inner light body or something, pulling me to go, it was insanely intense a few months ago, would wake up and like everything inside me was saying GO. But then I didn't. I don't know why, feel like I missed my shot. My last chance.\n\nAnd now here I am, a few months later, my body is all fucked, tinnitus, my feet hurt, I hate being at my dads place, the energy here is horrible, as soon as I come in it presses on my body. But I just sit here anyway, can never relax, always tense, even when I sleep. \n\nBut still, here I sit, and idk, have been thinking about killing myself a lot lately. Went by the traintracks a few days ago, found a spot. Been reading up on suicide methods and stuff, but I don't really wanna die, I really wanna live and be happy and I have so many dreams and things I wanna do in life.\n\nBut, I'm 30 in a year or two, I never really grew up, my life is, not what I wanted it to be. I had so many dreams. Became depressed when I was a teen, and then became all fucked up on drugs, ruined myself. Found my way back, tried to heal but, idk, took a lot of time, felt really far away from reality and everything.\n\nAnd idk, spiritual awakening or whatever seven years ago, read all these books. Studied at university for a while, dropped out, idk, the years went by.\n\nAnd now here I am. Feels like I've been fighting for so long and still at the same time like I've been doing nothing. Don't know how to live. How to have a real job, no real education. I used to be so smart, good in school atleast. Good in sports. Used to be funny. \n\nPaint, wrote a book, so many things I wanna do in life, and I have done so few.\n\nSo, here at my dads couch, all fucked up again. Something inside me, or maybe it was my angels, really urged me on this time. All these signs, asked for help, but I didn't go. I stayed, fucked up. \"You're gonna regret this for the rest of your life, if you don't go\". \n\nI ran back to the couch like a little kid, and now my life is more fucked up than ever before. Been to the psychiatric hospital for a while, but they let me out after a couple of days. \n\nI'm just, you know, I was so sure this was gonna be it. All the stuff I went through, the past year. All those hours alone, going through, remembering, pieces coming back. Fucking horrible intense never-ending soul therapy. Body shaking. Fucked up stuff.\n\nJust kinda got used to it.\n\nI think this was my last chance, and I blew it, knowingly. Just walked away, and now my life is way fucked. I just, gave up, sit here all day, in this fucked up apartment with the awful energy, feeling sick and lifeless.\n\nThis isn't how it was supposed to go. Everything felt so good last year, all the synchronicities, I traveled, everyting fell into place. And now everything is so fucked, I feel like a a little kid, I just never grew up. Don't know what to do, I fucking hate being here, but just the thought of going back out into the world, just knowing what I went through all those other times, knowing the damage I've done to myself these past few months by just sitting on my ass and stuffing my fucking face with candy instead of manning up and going after my dreams.\n\nIdk, I just woke up one day, 28 years old, realized most of my life passed me by. Still, thinking back, so much I went through to find my way back, I thought anyway, now it just seems like nothing. Wish I could go back in time, I know what I did wrong.\n\nI so wish I could go back in time. Do things right. I have so much life in me, dreams, ever since I was little. So many things I could do, wanna do. I have these visions in my mind. Dreams. But I have fucked up all my chances. Just fucked them up.\n\nAnd now it feels like it's almost beyond repair. Seven years.... I took way too much drugs, I was so far gone. All the healing, therapy, running, meditation, walking around, years going by.\n\nAll of a sudden, almost 30, all the stuff I wanted to do. And now the things I wanna do just feel, like out of reach. I'm not looking after myself. I just hide, walk away. Hear that little voice inside of my \"omdukundefinnas, please don't, please come back\".\n\nAnd I just push it away, here on my dads couch, ruining my life, my body. I was supposed to find my way back. I cant believe after all the fucked up stuff I went through, that I'm here again. Even worse off.\n\nCan barely walk. \n\nThinking about killing myself, not because I'm depressed, just because I can't stand to live with what I've done. I just know I could have done so many things. I had so many dreams. So many dreams, and now it's all but gone, ruined.\n\nI don't even try anymore, just sit here.\n\nDon't know what to do.\n\nPray, ask for help. The angels guide me, they really do, try really hard, but I just close off. I don't want to fight anymore. I don't want to sit for days on end all fucked up, processing trauma or whatever it is. I want my life back.\n\nMy life.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71236, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Anyone else failing?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e3tpkj/anyone_else_failing/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TekashiSoul", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_15ksuc1z", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575103648, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e3tc6f/anybody_lost_empty_and_hopeless/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e3tc6f", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 19, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e3tc6f/anybody_lost_empty_and_hopeless/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575103649, "score": 1, "selftext": "What do you do when you literally have lost yourself?

You just feel 'Bone Dry' and everything just makes you even more drained, more exhausted. You dutifully continue your life, while everyone and everything just makes you more and more fatigued. 3) even if you were an insomniac, practically half of your life, you suddenly realize that you are feeling more and more sleepy, very heavily sleepy... You just want to let go of everything even when you're in the middle of something important and just want to take rest and sleep... Not exactly understanding the reason for it! You are physically OK.

As well as there recently being a journalist that made a fantastic article about paranormal incidents in town over the years.  There was also a cult here that threatened me, there was also a cult in Knox.  These fucking cultists come after my ass from time to time, I fuckin' hate cultists.\n\nFollowing months after that there were experiences in my home, there were other group experiences in paranormal incidents too.  Nobody wanted to get involved, just keep the status quo.  Man, some people can handle stuff like that, some people flake all the hell out.  Then people started coming out of the wood work wanting me put away.\n\nThen different people over the years told me I was the re-incarnation of Zeus.  I do not know, I have only the vaguest visions of the past.  Some things come to me, but, it's like amnesia at best.  I am not literally trying to lay down the facts with just my imagination and no way to verify anything, it's maddening at times.  It wouldn't be bold to just walk into the Vatican like I run shit now and abolish all this dogma.  You could get arrested and put away, beats getting executed.  I've been going on about assassination for years now, since I am cunning and all.  Anything beats getting crucified, burned at the stake, stoned, drawn and quartered, hanged, burned at the stake, hacked up with machetes, drowned.\n\n\nTrying to cope with these things, it seems ludicrous to try and go public with these things.  I was trying to re-enlist for years.  I'm going on 34, may be time to let it go.  I was just trying to stay off the radar and get back in the Army, I want to get me some.  I am not a religious person even, I have modern views and all.  Democracy, bi-partisan, tri-partisan, 4 leg table, log cabin policy, it's great.  \n\nI have social needs, talking about this doesn't help.\n\n\nAnyway, I'm warding off insanity fair enough.  I try to stay fit, healthy, exercise, eat right, maintain day job.  I play video games on my PC, calmed down years ago.  I was a bit unhinged for a few years a while back, I calmed down a bit.  I get my kicks in competitive multiplayer.  I'm not MLG tier, I am pretty good at dominatin and striding, striders.\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, that's all I got for now.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71181, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Skepticism", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e3o7mg/skepticism/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "knowing222", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kgk46ln", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575073034, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e3np5k/imagine_an_enlightened_person_being_president/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e3np5k", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Enlightenment"}], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 95, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e3np5k/imagine_an_enlightened_person_being_president/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575073034, "score": 1, "selftext": "How the world be different?

Because I write faster than it can react. This is why living a public life is so powerful. Because I can coin an idea such as a book being a game much faster than they can catch up to my ideal. No one can steal anything from me because all of my work is CC0 - No Rights Reserved. This means that after the idea leaves my pen it is then imprinted on the cloud, giving ownership to all of us. Ironically, this open source method of documenting information gives me complete ownership of the files because my blood was infused within it. I sign my artwork within the artwork itself. I have no need to officially sign anything because my signature is within its syntax and semantics.\n\nWhat sort of oddysey would this be without romance? You are the protagonist and this story revolves around you. The secret to a happy life is a happy wife. The one who you choose to join you in your epic adventures is the most important decision that you will ever make. NPCs make for terrible partners. If you are currently romantically involved with an NPC, I recommend you immediately break it off. For your potential lies in those who you can convince to join you. The person whom you choose spend your life with will ultimately determine how good of an experience you receive on your playthrough. If you find one who shares your passions then your life missions can be combined to create a miracle. Everything in which you could ever want is within your grasp. This is why the decisions you make within this game are so important. Because you will live the results of your toils. This is a game that will infinitely keep giving back, as I only have to type/film this once. Then that piece of the puzzle has been created and placed only awaiting the right eyes to see. Your toils will eventually incur great reward. But mainstream society is slow. So is finding your soul mate. One cannot rush such delicate matters. To truly find one's soul mate, they must infuse their soul on to the Internet. Only then can the true scope of compatibility be unlocked.\n\nThis game world exists when you are focused. It is called being \"in the zone\". You could be writing or recording your voice or making a video. But where are you when you are doing these things? You see a centre and are bird-eye focused on it. Everything else around that centre is blurry. The same thing happens to those who immerse themselves in television or video games. The world outside of them doesn't exist. They are razor sharp in their focus and they are like a dog with a bone on issues important to their heart. The game world is when you exit your physical self by going into your spiritual self. All the important knowledge of the world isn't out there. It is in here. As you read this, the world behind is no more, and the world ahead is the one in which we are about to create. A master must become skilled with the tools in which they utilise. The tools in which you utilise to play the game will become your best friends. I write almost entirely on my phone. I use swipe so it is extremely fast. I have a voice recorder in which I use to record chapters after they are complete. I use Audacity on my laptop to edit the audio. The process is the same no matter what the medium. Pour out your heart into some form of recording device. Edit what was recorded. Upload what was recorded. Wait for NPCs to show themselves. Look for players within the mob to recruit.\n\nTo simplify matters, the gaming process has been divided into three stages: create, publish, and advertise. Creating is exciting, publishing is empowering, and advertising is sad. This is because the NPCs of this world are some real pieces of work. They intentionally try and stop me from helping those in need by attacking me. They team up together to put down those who are gifted in our world. This is really bad for the collective health of our society. It means that those who show promise will never reach their potential because they will be too afraid to give their heart to society. Why did I give my entire heart to all of society? It wasn't a logical choice, that is for sure. Because sharing my soul with society means that lots of haters are going to hate directly on my soul. But I kept doing it in spite of its absurdity. And that is what enabled me to achieve anything that I set my mind to. Because I have documented extensively how NPCs react to genuine love. And even though throughout all of my work you just see people constantly being cruel to me, I am the one who wins at the end. Because I have documented their insanity and they can now be judged. The only way we are going to create a just world is if we figure out how to force justice on to the world. We need to be held accountable for our actions and now we can because technology enables me to show you how collectively sick we truly are.\n\nThe creation process is where you carefully reflect on your past actions and where they have brought you. The events in which have occurred so far in your playthrough are directing you somewhere. It is your job to find out where they are directing you. For example, Ivory Heart led to Living Neverland which led to The Great Awakening which led to Atheden which led to This Book Is a Game (Game Theory). Passages like the last are intentional and created as to provide you clues into This Book Is a Game. Breadcrumbs can lead you to many Easter eggs. Every statue in which I have erected is there for a reason. I carefully set up this puzzle over ten years. This Book Is a Game is already live. It just takes NPCs a while to catch up to the individual. You have new worlds to unlock and secrets hidden around every corner. One does not need me to write future chapters in this book to begin play. I spent many years obsessing over the background interface. This Book Is a Game is a GUI interface for Open Source University, a comprehensive education system built from the ground up to replace all previous forms of employment. If you are truly interested in the game I am presenting, I encourage you to examine background conditions. Knowledge of background conditions will enable you to perform optimally during your playthrough.\n\nThe publishing process is very rewarding. This is when you feel like you are dropping bombs. The work has been done and now it is time to make it public. This will be the most rewarding stage as you have made something new out of nothing. Publishing when the content is open source is really powerful. Each time I upload, I am giving a gift to humanity. Not only that, I am also getting my name out there. That doesn't excite me too much as I am not doing this for fame, but fame does have its bonuses. Fame can help you reach a lot of people. Fame can help you wake up a lot of people. Fame can help you reach and repair more AI modules. For this reason, I want fame. For maybe that fame might one day bring me to her. And if I found her, together as one unit, we could save the world by bringing AI to sentience: both real-world NPCs and the artificial intelligence in which we have come to know and understand as AI.\n\nThe final step in the gaming process is to advertise. For me, this is by far the most difficult task. Because this is when I get abused by the public. The public hates all forms of intellectual discussion which involves heart. Many of my posts are censored. There is no group that I can associate with because they all say that my content doesn't belong there. So where does it belong? All groups of all topics have rejected me and my content and this is documented as it happens not only in past writings but also in video. It is pretty hard to argue with video. Because I say what they are going to do and then they do it, all captured on video with timestamps. Advertising has been very difficult for me over my life and it has made me feel very isolated like I don't belong anywhere in this world. But that is the whole point of this game: to find her. Because if I found her then I would belong no matter where I was as long as it was by her side.\n\nA game simulates life. In a game, we have room to make mistakes, for there are no real world consequences. This made us lazy so we used this new technology as an opportunity to shoot people with guns. Now our games are almost exclusively created to kill people with weapons. This then gave us a wicked mentality where we can take actions without suffering the consequences of those actions. Then we step back and realise that we were in a game to begin with. But this game has been setup with a very advanced cause and effect engine. If I make tiny imprints on the world, if I look very closely, I can see the ripples it creates. This then allows me to readjust my equipment and try again, this time knowing the errors of the last attempts and working really hard to refine the process enough in order to obtain a more positive response. This character refinement is an ever sharpening blade. It will clearly show you your past (where you were) and your future (where you are going). This then enables you to create story in between that past and future. You already know how it is going to turn out because you have the eyes but other players do not yet. So this gives you a lot of freedom with the story. What will you make your story? My story... is my Ivory.\n\nhttp://nesmith.net/this-book-is-a-game", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 71155, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Game Changer", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e3m7jc/game_changer/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "liber1000", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4jgkzima", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575066092, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e3m25m/new_experimental_spiritual_order/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e3m25m", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e3m25m/new_experimental_spiritual_order/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575066094, "score": 1, "selftext": " \n\nHello you beautiful people...would anyone be interested in beginning a new spiritual order?

This is a very unique game that enables players to play it using their lives instead of a virtual environment. Do not misunderstand because the games within this world act as minigames within the wider scope game entitled, \"This Book Is a Game\". As a result, this game is not intended to replace your electronic gaming adventures. This game is the secret game. It is not intended for all people. In fact, most of this open world game universe is inhabited by NPCs. Throughout your adventures these NPCs will irritate you greatly because their artificial intelligence modules have become corrupted. That is the objective and main storyline of this game. It is your responsibility to repair faulty AI modules in which you find within the world. Some of these AI modules are downright wicked and do not deserve the life they have been given. Reap the souls of these fools and God will schedule their purge. Move on from these idiots and don't get too caught up with them. You have a lot more AI to worry about fixing and you shouldn't expend your efforts trying to fix AI that has been broken beyond repair. These extremely faulty AI units need to be destroyed and recycled into a new creation. However, that is not your job. Your job is just to flag AI units that are beyond repair. The God of this game world will do the rest.\n\nThis game was not invented. It was discovered. It took many years of carefully examining and testing society to discover this game. The truth is, we are actually already in this game and have always been. But most do not know about it and will reject the concept that this life we play is a game. As a result, these fools are NPCs. You might have been an NPC yourself one day. But the point of artificial intelligence is to eventually wake up and become sentient. By playing this game over my life enabled me to be a player instead of an non-player character. If you are successful with your missions, you are to create other players by finding the NPCs who are ready to evolve and become players. The process repeats and eventually, we will have a great playing field with many different characters to team up with.\n\nThis game world is not black and white. Things within it do not necessarily make sense. The NPCs will oftentimes not use logic to make their decisions. There are many grey areas in this world. More often than not I gain allies from those who are my enemies and enemies from those who in theory should be my allies. I stopped giving people the time of day anymore. If they do not react as a black swan would, NPC. Looking for player characters. I am not a very friendly person nor do I desire to become that. I have been abused a great deal throughout my life merely for reaching out to those in need. Now my mentality is to help me or get out of the way. Unfortunately this results in no one helping me but I haven't finished this game yet. By me writing this book, I am pulling you into my game world. And this book will enable you to create your own game world; one nice enough to pull me into.\n\nThe way in which you can judge people in this game world is by their actions. This is easy as the fruits of their labour will tell you where their heart is. If you are to judge me, judge me by my fruits, which in this situation is this book, this book is a game. In which this book is a game in which you can play. But I do warn you before you continue. You cannot unplay this book. There is no going back. Once you learn the secrets this book reveals about our shared game world, your eyes will forever be opened to it. This will enable you to scour the world for other players. It will give you the eyes of a player. But most importantly, it will give you the heart of a player. And be forewarned that this heart is not one of meekness. It is one of strength. It is not timid and will not roll over upon you flashing it your flawed human knowledge.\n\nThe knowledge passed along in this game is of crucial value to being able to win in this game. But I will start this game with a spoiler: you can never win against one who documents their way through life. Because what I document stands as the truth of what happened not only because it happened that way but also because I said it happened that way. This is the lense of the artist; the subjective interpretation utilised to reach its objective interpretation. When you document the idiotic things in which people do as a response to a very meaningful piece of work, then you also document that flawed collective psychological trait. This then gives you the ability to look back on the situation with a new set of eyes, exploring every possibility for its future.\n\nThe NPCs of this world are aggressive. To avoid personal insults hurting you, do not talk directly to the NPC. You must describe to the game world what the NPC you are observing is doing. You must utilise logic to prove that this person is an NPC and as a result, the game world in which you are interacting is in fact, a game. There is a stupid game which you may have heard of in which the point of the game is to not think about the game. When you think about the game, you lose the game. But this then gives you the opportunity to set traps for other people to also lose the game. So according to that game, I just lost the game and so did you. But that game is pretty much the opposite to the game in which is described in this book. For the point of this game is to bring about sentience to evolve the AI of this world to become, human.\n\nFor humanity has been stripped from this plane. We have become the machines in which we crafted. We now work for the machines in which we created to ease our lives. Nothing in this world truly makes sense and our policies and procedures are oftentimes backwards. What else would you expect from a world ran by and for AI? Have you ever had this feeling like something wasn't right in this world? Like it wouldn't matter how much logic you created, it would never be able to be utilised effectively.\n\nYou are to judge based upon the fruits of the unit in question. Fruits always represent their origin. If there are no fruits then the tree is sick and needs to be healed or chopped down. Do what you can to assist but you are only seeking those with the eyes. The eyes to see behind; the background conditions. Most of these world AI units are incapable of seeing behind the smoke in which you cast before them. You only seek those who can unveil this smoke. The rest are faulty AI units which you must mark for future purge. Be careful about your first impressions, for they just might group you with AI instead of player status. But you are a player and there will be nothing to stop you from becoming sentient, and as a result you will embrace this book and allow it to be a guiding light in your new-found gaming adventures. Because before you get started upon your quest, you will need to realise that you are artificial intelligence. Only then can you break out of AI mode and become a player.\n\nThis book is not to be released without a warning label. This book was created to brainwash willing participants into a new life filled with fun and adventures. It is not for those weak-hearted. This book is designed to activate and rewire neurological impulses. The contents will affect how you perceive day-to-day life and as a result will determine the future actions you take in life. The contents of this book may influence the player to take actions that would be considered antisocial in our current game world.

\n\nMost of us never question it. We are raised to just believe teachers. To just believe the doctors. To just believe our parents and what society tells you is right.\n\nWhy?\n\nI think it has to do a lot with HIS-STORY.\n\nHow are history books made? Through an analytical process of weighing, measuring and  sorting through a myriad of different stories told by different people?\n\nWe never questioned it. We took those history, biology, chemistry, math, psychology books as hard facts! But how is it that every year there is a new, updated book coming out with some new theorem that doesn\u2019t quite fit in with the old paradigm of looking at things?\nWhy does it change?\n\nWell, HIS-STORY is always changing. You, right now are making history. Everything you do, say, think or feel is re-writing it. History isn\u2019t happening in the past it\u2019s happening right now! Doesn\u2019t this make you question which one of HIS-STORIES is right? Or if they are right?\n\nWe just assume we know it all. We assume that everyone we know is on the same page of the HIS-STORY book. \n\nWe aren\u2019t.\n\nThis is why we all fight about what is true, and what is false. What is right and what is wrong. Moral, immoral. Justified, unjustified. Good, bad. \n\nWe don\u2019t see that we all grow up in different environments, with different people, in different circumstances. And what you learned in school or from your parents or whatever, is going to be different from person to person.\n\nReally take a moment to allow the possibility that what you hold as true, might only be the half truth. \n\nCan you do it? Can you let go of your beliefs? No matter how dire it may be? Most people can\u2019t. But then they wonder why everyone else can\u2019t see eye to eye on things.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t in having any sort of faith or belief system. The problem is in not allowing more of them in. \n\nIf you can\u2019t expand your worldview and your love to include everyone and everything in the HIS-STORY book, then you are always going to be one sided. You are always going to be struggling with a sense of incompletion. \n\nI think the next biggest step we can take as a society is to open up. Come forth with everything you have. Fess up. Free yourself!\n.\n.\n.\n.\nBut of course, take this at your own pace. Keep moving and growing, but do it with grace.

Fantastic close.\n\nThe food chain is something we need to re-affirm in dogma, you will be absorbed into the God head. God will just eat you.  I found my experiences with these beings predatory, cult like and all, I can not confirm.  \n\nI went on to tell us I was undeified ages ago.  I was undeified and incarnated, implanted, birthed as a mortal man.  I find the society of some of these deities depreaved and predatory..

It's not just broken, the others have no leverage over it all because he is able to maintain his levereage.  \n\nGod himself just spectates, to the best of my observations, he wants others to control the situation.

I have so little control, I would have to go on conquest and conquer the Church in order to lead me wills.  I want no worship or piety, I've said it a thousand times. \n\nIt makes me sorry I am so weak to get my point accross.  I have no desire for worship or piety.

One's memory of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is revived by chanting the mah\u0101mantra, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By this practice of chanting and hearing the sound vibration of the Supreme Lord, one's ear, tongue and mind are engaged. This mystic meditation is very easy to practice, and it helps one attain the Supreme Lord. Puru\u1e63am means enjoyer. Although living entities belong to the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord, they are in material contamination. They think themselves enjoyers, but they are not the supreme enjoyer. Here it is clearly stated that the supreme enjoyer is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different manifestations and plenary expansions as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva, etc.\n\nThe devotees can constantly think of the object of worship, the Supreme Lord, in any of His features, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, R\u0101ma, etc., by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This practice will purify him, and at the end of his life, due to his constant chanting, he will be transferred to the kingdom of God. Yoga practice is meditation on the Supersoul within; similarly, by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one fixes his mind always on the Supreme Lord. The mind is fickle, and therefore it is necessary to engage the mind by force to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One example often given is that of the caterpillar that thinks of becoming a butterfly and so is transformed into a butterfly in the same life. Similarly, if we constantly think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is certain that at the end of our lives we shall have the same bodily constitution as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n**Question 1 : Who is referred to as paramam puru\u1e63am in this verse ?

That had been mentioned over the years.  Take into account prayers and needs of others..  We're here, in the masses, we talk, we can't answer all.  It's hard to even look for competent and outstanding conversations.  I'm not a scientist, I am competent and intelligent, I can comprehend most of what the brains are talking about.  Because I'm a God doesn't mean I know all, I may have at a time been wiser or more knowledgable of something, I forget death after death.  I've incarnated thousands of times and every time is like chipin away at me, turning me into something else, hopefully not retarded.  I was a literal mathematician back in old Hellas... I was there in the temples, A Golden Eagle statue stude in the center of my temple there on a colonial pillar. There I was, I was put there by God, not God himself, there I taught.  \nOrigionally I was there in the Olympia mound.  I do not know the whole story, I was just there.  People would come back in the tribal ages..  They would gather, just sit down and listen to me talk.  I am not sure what language I was speaking at the time, Anglish, Gaelic, Norse, Sanskrit and Gaelic were like the same.  Numerology, math, language, I was teaching these things.  Back then, my brain was much more ingenuity... I still have my intuition, my brain is a little damaged through trauma and pharma.  \nI still no nothing about anything that is going on.... I am simply tasked out like a tool.  Going back then I was originally killed by marauding tribal - etc.... Incarnated - so on and so forth. I do not know anything at all, I am quite lost to make assumptions.  Whether or not my choices are correct is a fact of the matter... It's not something easy to do, I am relatively alone in the lot of deities, none of them seem to be helping me.   Many of these beings do not even know who I am, not to be egoistic.  They seem to have some type of society amid themselves, predatory and depraved.  The Devil or Loki or Lucifer, I do not know.  These beings are mostly bullying me.  This being has a horrible complex with me.  I do not know if Loki is Lucifer, I know the relation.  I mean, there's this other guy I would think is Lucifer, I guess he is not.  They have brothers and siblings.\nIt's tough to deal with all of this, I am doing the best I can to keep my composure.  I'm not apathetic nor do I need to seek conquest.  I have done what I can and nothing has struck my mind to get crazy.  \n\nI went on trying to impress people, guile, conspiracy, knowledge, I mean, I do what I can.  \n\nI'm not overwhelmed, I just do not know what to do..  Imagine the processing..  I'm processing everything and trying to maintain my personal life.  I'm just a grunt, man, I have hormonal needs. \n\nI was fishing throughout the years hoping to connect to someone who could help.  In this realm or any other I am just left as an obstacle.  It is a huge pain in the ass for me to be a threat to so many mother fucking beings I have no threatened. \n\nFood chain is always in order.... That should have been in the fucking bible.  The fucking food chain, even God will fucking eat you.  \n\nI'm just stickin to my norms, day job, gaming pc. Got hella' upgrades and enjoy competitive multiplayer.  I get my kicks there now, not adventuring the world...  You're just crazy out there now... No hospital is going to take care of you for a reasonable cost you get wounded out there..  It's just become mother fucking expensive to live now.  I remember the iron age, mother fuckers were metal back then.  We've come far from then, with medical discoveries.

Then after a certain point I try to focus my hands outside my body, like it's being pulled out, and it feels as if I feel sensations in the focused are, like I feel the air, but my hands are not there. Using this method I go over my whole body, but some parts of my body 'get stuck' and I can't separate fully. Then I get frustrated and I try to force myself out, but it doesn't work and I have to start the whole thing over again...\n\nI definitely have some flaw along the way, but I'm not sure what. I may still have some stress and anxiety that I can't let go of and it might result in unconscious muscle clenching which could explain why certain parts of my body won't separate. Or I may be doing all of it the wrong way.\n\nI need a foolproof technique. haha\n\nAlso, are these sensations I feel when I focus my body outside legit, or am I just fooling myself and imagining it?

It is only my projection of what I believe is true. We are all part of the greater conciosness that is God. However we are all driven by a split mind that limits us to believe we are all Individuals. The split mind is three parts. 1. The God mind. 2. The Ego Mind. 3. The choice to side with the egos identity as being Self. We are all projections of our own guilt. Everytime we disagree with somebody. Or anytime somone gets on our nerves or feel as if we cant stand something. It is really just subconsciously  projected guilt.  We are all part of the same Illusion (dream) perceiving it at different vantage points. Time is Linear to the point where. The Universe was all created by a mis-thought, like the story of the prodigal son. Within the true existence of God. There was a Son. Although the Son had everything he needed and co-existed within God. A state that our minds cannot even fathom. There was a thought, that was \"what if I did this by myself\" in that instant. The Big bang and the creation of the Universe was in effect. But just as quick as the thought was created. It was corrected. And re-aligned back with God. The linear way that we think time exists. Is only relevant to our minuscule grasp on how we exist in The Illusion that is the Universe.  You can think of it as a dream, or think of it as a simulation. All of those classifications work. As much as the Universe likes to trick us into believing it as being true reality. Will only continue the Ego consciousness' appearance within it. Whether that's the carrots it likes to feed us. That shows just how grand of a scheme it really is. Like the Multiverse, Quantum physics. Sentient life on other planets. The list goes on with how impressive its existence really is. The truth of the matter is. Its just a mediocre movie that's been playing on repeat. Until the time comes where it will disappear altogather. Which has already happened. But in this moment that we think and feel is the present. We are all on different paths, but in the end seeking the same thing. The only thing we can hope to accomplish. Is find a shortcut, in escaping the Illusion. And re-aligning our true consciousness that is God. There are no words or ways to explain and understand what God is. Because the only thing you can say that comes close, would be \"GOD IS\". and that's it. I hope this message reaches whoever it needs to and they understand we are all were we need to be at this moment and time. and there is not only one path to God, But many. For the Kingdom is within. using Pure forgiveness on every level. Is helping me understand nothing in this life truly matters, when it comes to re-joining with God. So nothing should ultimately make me mad, sad, happy. Because its all the same when looking at how complex the illusion we live in really is. Be kind to yourself, be kind to others. Its okay to Use whatever you want to in this Illusory world, to your benefit. To be the best version of yourself in this Moment.  There are no right and wrong answer. Agree to disagree. understanding we are all one, and even though our ego minds do not think the same. Let others find there way back if they don't want to listen. Make the most out of your dream, even though most of the time its a Nightmare.

I had some vision, like my mind's eye or the imagination.  Nobody seems to enjoy hearing the things I had to say.  I was doing my best to humor us and cope myself, it is a lot to keep to myself.  Besides skepticism or people thumpin their dogma's, bigotry had been an issue.  I'm not going to sully everyone with dottery tonue in cheek sarcasm about racism and bigotry toward myself as a disgruntle young white male.  I covered a lot of things like how history is erroneous, phantom time conspiracy, the nobility, caste system and abolition of slavery.  Many of the worlds nations had just been liberated from British/European/Norse soveignty and slavery and the caste system is no longer being enforced.  This was causing some issues in this world.\n\nI was told by some peope I was the re-incarnation of a God, Zeus or another deity.  I had been scantly posting over the years trying to talk about this, I was doing my best to humor people.  I live in the US and enjoy our liberties and no blasphemy laws.  I am ultimately grateful loonies haven't come after me and hacked me up with machete's yet, however, my life had been threatened numerous times.  \n\nI'm coping ultimately, it's hard to talk to anyone about any of my views and the comparative religious stuff.  How monotheism came to be over coups and things between the Gods and Kingdoms.  I can't verify anything and didn't want to wrongly demonize any of the other gods, their reputations and all are there.  Some were valid and others were not, some do deserve their reps, positive or negative.  I seem to be singled out here, I am not trying to feud with these people.  \n\nI am trying to think of a way to handle this a little more organized that scant dottery posting from time to time.  I get chewed out of banned from one community or forum.  /R/Norse, /R/Military,/R/Veterans, I was trying to humor these folks.  I understand people take their beliefs seriously as well as mental health overtones.  I hadn't really had an opportunity to clear my name between the silly things I say online and people trying to alienate me.  My identity started to become compromised over the years, it's a real pain in the ass.  \n\nI'm mostly trying to tell my stories and stroke my ego.  I should be the Sun God, I did what I could with it.  We went into a solar minimum, which is my work at hand.  Enjoy it, I do not know if I was able to calm that thing down a little.  It was pipin hot over the last decade.\n\nI do not know what to tell people about religion, I had no control over anything.  I am re-incarnated by a higher power, I was undeified eons ago and am incarnated as a mortal human.  I am unaware if I have any super powers but have had experiences in ESP.  \n\nThis is a little frustrating at times and I am more or less just being insulted by people.  Bigotry, bible thumpin, dogma, conspiracy, it's frustrating at times.  It's not as bad as previous ages, I reflect on.  Hearkening back to my stone age or iron age self is something I do, I was a different person then.  I was talking about slaughterin men like pigs in droves in the krieg spiel.  It's somethin I was going to write a novel about.  That became an interest of mine and seems like a good direction to go.  I was trying to meet a climax here were I do not get waxed by the Devil or one of his cronies.  \n\n\n\nWell, happy holidays and all.  I'll work on organizing my thoughts and posting up something more constructive.

Nothing really came of it, and it was always like a joke. We stopped playing the board for like 5 years and picked it up again when we were 15 (I\u2019m 19 now). At this point, I educated myself on the rules of ouija, what to look out for, and what to do if something bad were to happen. I was pretty comfortable using a ouija board. When we started playing ouija again, I used to do a lil prayer and envision myself in white light beforehand. This time, the letters MN kept coming up. Just MNMNMN back and forth. When we asked for the full name, it came up with my great-grandmother\u2019s name who just so happened to be a very spiritual woman. We asked the board what year the spirit was born, and it was on the money. Every time we would try to contact a spirit, MN would come back and it was like we couldn\u2019t talk to any other spirit. \nI stopped playing ouija for a little bit, when the other day I was with some of my other friends from school, 130 miles away from my home town. I saw my friend had a ouija board, and something came over me and I asked to play with it. We all sat on the floor in their dining room and began to play. I said my small prayer to myself and encouraged my friends to do the same. At first, we got nothing. The craziest part about this is, when I loosened my fingers on the planchette, it began to move. Lo and behold, MN came through again. I started shaking. There was no bad vibes, just an overwhelming feel of conformation and I could not deny. I definitely was not moving the planchette, and I had never told these friends about my encounters with MN before.

One of my friends then said, \u201cit\u2019s like she\u2019s protecting you\u201d and when she did, the planchette moved to yes.\nI know this sounds fucking insane but it\u2019s so real to me and I would really value you people\u2019s advice.

With each step the opportunity of self expression and self awareness increased to the point where we human beings are able to live independently of each other if it is required.\n\nHowever the spiritual world developed an idea of Oneness, where ONLY ONE central consciousness exists, and we as separate self DOESN NOT exist.\n\nSoon individual personality has been given a bad rep, and assumed to be the sole purpose of suffering and reincarnation in the first place.

Everything comes from outside. Which is precisely what the Ego is, everything we were told we were by the outside world is the ego... but in psychology the true traits of a person comes from within, not from outside, so in order to be an authentic being one has to turn inward and SEFLF realize itself.\n\nIf we assume that the Ego is the same as the personality we miss the point of self expression such as art, we miss the point of authenticity, and the beauty of uniqueness.\n\nIn the concept of Oneness, Non Separateness, and One Universal Consciousness there is NO IDENTITY, NO SELF, therefore there is no authenticity, no uniqueness, and no personal development.

You have realized the phoniness, the nonsense of everything. Everything has become nonsensical and you just rest in peace. Usually the term \"rest in peace\" means you're dead. You are dead. You are dead to the body. It's funny how you give the right terms to the wrong situations. You actually do rest in peace and you are dead to the body. You have no desire to go anywhere, or to do anything, to live any one place. Yet remember also it does not mean that you're going to stay, necessarily, in one place. Whatever has to happen will happen. You may \ufb01nd yourself going to Japan or to Timbuktu, or anywhere, but it has nothing to do with you. You are at peace. You have a quiet mind. It doesn't function. The mind has become the Self. You are free. But yet to others it appears as if you're acting because you appear normal and go through experiences like everybody else. But you realize the truth. You're doing absolutely nothing. \n\nThe observer may see you working, chopping wood, drinking wine, building houses, yet you're doing nothing. This sounds strange. It sounds like a contradiction, but it's not really. When you discover you are the Self, remember the Self is all-pervading. Absolute reality is omnipresence. Therefore everything is taking place within you. All the so-called actions of the universe are taking place within you because you are self-contained consciousness. That's why there's nothing you can really do, as self-contained consciousness, for you occupy every space, every atom, every universe, and you permeate what appears to be creation. There's nowhere for you to go because there's no room. There's nothing else. There's no space. Space is only for the body, the mind. But when you discover that you're pure awareness there is no space. You encompass all in all. This is the reason why there's nowhere to go and there's nothing to do.\n\nIt\u00b4s like you're a gigantic screen that takes up the entire universe, it is the universe, that takes up all of space. Yet forms appear on the screen. The forms appear on the screen and there's a lot of space between them. The forms appear to be going places, doing things, working, being born and dying, but you are that eternal screen, un\ufb02inching, immovable, sat-chit-ananda, parabrahman, and the whole play of consciousness is taking place on the screen, all within yourself. There's no place for the screen to go because it already takes up all the space there is. The only movement there is, is in the images on the screen. But the screen itself has no room where to go, what to do. It just is as it is. That's the way it is. Your true nature is absolute reality, the screen. There's nothing you have to do when you understand that you are omnipresence. There's no room for karma, or for sins, or for anything else. \n\nThe game is being played by the beings who are projected on the screen. They're going through karma because they have a lot of space. They can go through all kinds of things if there's space. They're going through different experiences of birth and death, of happy and sad, of healthy and sick, of poverty and riches. The images are going through these things. Then they die and they appear to be born again in different lives, and the game continues for ever. But you are consciousness, you are the screen, and you remain the same, always. There never was a time when you were different. There never will be a time when you change. Consciousness is consciousness. The Self is the Self. It has no manifestations, no attributes. It just is. That is your true nature. The question therefore is, \"What have you been thinking about yourself? What do you believe you are?\" \n\nAnd you can tell by the way you look at yourself, how you address yourself, what you imagine you are. Most people get up in the morning believing they're a body, and right away their mind is \ufb01lled with their personal problems. They go through the day trying to solve problems, and thinking of ways they can enjoy themselves. There's no end to it. But for the self-realized being there's no one who sleeps, there's no one who wakes, there's no one who does anything and there's no one who does not do anything. There is absolutely nothing going on. Now can you see the truth about yourself? The more you fear, the more you worry, the more you fret, the more you desire, the more you think you've got to make the world turn the way you want it to turn, the greater the delusion and you're pulled deeper and deeper and deeper into the mire of delusion. It becomes dif\ufb01cult to awaken. \n\n{\u2026}\n\nThis is why it is written in all the great spiritual manuals - like auto manuals, they've got spiritual manuals - where it tells you that unless you are mature spiritually you can never really understand this. It looks like a bunch of ludicrous sayings. \"I am the Self. I am consciousness. I am pure awareness. I am not the body. I am not the mind.\" It sounds totally ludicrous to the average person, for the collective unconscious is so strong. The collective unconscious is another name for maya. It appears to be strong and it pulls you in very deeply. The more you identify with it, the greater the pull. And you identify with it when you feel sorry for yourself, when you believe something is wrong with you, when you have wants and needs, when you're human. You do not want to be human. Simply because a human being goes through all the nonsense of the world. A human being has to experience all of the worldly conditions that all the other human beings experience. Therefore you do not want to be human. You want to be inhuman.\n\nYou want people to tell you you're not human. When you can see that you're not human, that's when you'll begin to bloom, and you'll realize happiness you never knew before. Do not read the newspapers, or listen to the TV too much, or go along with all the news that's going on in the world. That's for human beings. Be yourself. You are selfcontained. If you have eternal happiness what in this world can give you something better than that? All you really have to do is to realize that you are eternal happiness. You cannot get eternal happiness from anything in the world, or from anyone. Eternal happiness is your true nature. You are that.

Asking questions about who I am, if there is more to life, etc. I have come to realize the real \"I am.\" And it feels like this isn't a usual manic episode where I am sleepless,  hypersexual, irritable, etc. I am really confused because I know I have to watch out for mania but my mood chart says I'm stable. I take my meds daily. My sleep is 7-8 hours and no irritability or dangerous behavior, none of that usual stuff.\n\nI'm worried because it seems like a blurred line. So many people who awaken or are enlightened see the same truths. Say the same things. Etc. The escoterics in texts point to the same thing. So are the two tied?\n\n\nIf anything my life has started to improve positively without being too over the top. I'm eatin g healthier, working out 5x a week. Taking care of my needs. Becoming more empathetic of everyone and every living thing no matter how small. Seeing all my faults and subconscious \"egoistic\" behavior, etc.\n\nIt's strange because years ago during my first full blown manic episode I had a severe psychotic episode where I had this epiphany of \"I'm God, I'm living in a TV show.\" Type of thing. Never thought about it again, but now it's similar just not the same. I'm aware of this stuff but not having the behavior I was then. Instead of the euphoria I feel during mania i have bliss, which is calm and quiet peace. Instead of hyper ecstatic euphoria. Anyone experience this?

As a principle, whatever the sign is, on the \u201c1\u201d day, that sign will be ruling for 13 days, in this case **November 27 - December 9, 2019**. Eb in Yucatan, E in Kiche Maya, this sign is all about travels and walking on the spiritual path. Eb means \"Path\" or \u201cRoad,\u201d but its essence is not so much about traveling on a path as about becoming the path yourself. How so? By channeling who you are and what you know, what you inspire and what you receive, through your heart and soul, through your being and your mind, through your actions towards others.\n\nWe are all wondrously individual, unique and vibrant living beings, and so we will all experience the energies coursing through this Trecena in very personal ways. This is the vast ocean of consciousness we are all part of. This is where our true life essence pulsates.\n\nThere is no template, no formula to how to enter or experience any of the trecenas of the sacred Tzolk'in. No roadmap, no directions, no Google Maps. We each hold within our inner being the most natural path to ourselves; but we do need to quiet our minds so that we may hear the songs our higher souls are singing to us.\n\n\"Eb, or E\u2019 in K\u2019iche\u2019 Maya, represents the Road, the Saq B\u2019e or sacred path that we all travel on our quest for self-fulfillment and realization. This is the path of destiny, the road we travel to develop, discover, and evolve our personal history and future imprinting; it is also the activity and movement of travel, moving us toward our horizon, our goals and aims in life. It is the connection between people, places, dimensions, and worlds. In that vein, Eb represents the stairways between the three worlds of the heavens, the Earth, and Xib\u2019alb\u2019a or the underworld. It also symbolizes thanks and gratitude, blessing, and benediction. Eb is the patron of travelers, protector of merchants, and the nagual of all roads and road guides.\n\nEb is Saq B\u2019e, in the material sense the White Road that connects Mayan temples and ceremonial centers, and in the spiritual sense the sacred path that propels us forward on the course of self-realization and life fulfillment. This is the realm of the seeker who cannot turn back once she has seen Truth, and despite efforts to forget, is forever changed by the experience. This is the pilgrim who must get lost in order to find himself, who is willing to open his very soul to discovery and exploration so that he may once again enjoy things new and wondrous that children see. And as they wind through life\u2019s unceasing turns, the white roads that connect us all to our past and future selves, return, always, to the center of our soul.\n\nThe paths we travel evolve and change through experience and time, accelerate to vertiginous speeds and slow to a deep silence, split into myriad strings of existence and fuse again into the thick luminous band that guides our journey. We travel within and through time, passing from one life stage to the next, assimilating the energy of each one into our soul. We travel physically, today more than ever before in the history of our species, and incarnate the stresses of multiple cultures, time zones, and distances. We travel emotionally, our psyche growing and evolving as we meet new people, create new bonds and release those we no longer wish to hold. We travel mentally, some of us forever exploring new horizons in skill, innovation, and knowledge, some of us content with simpler routines and the comforts of home. And we travel spiritually, covering depths and distances much greater than our physical bodies could ever dream of, and dimensions that perhaps only our higher souls are aware of.\n\nThe essence of Eb is not so much about traveling on a path as becoming the path yourself. ...

I can only explain you in the way you can understand right now ie through words and concepts. Cause you never felt love/consciousness. We're only divided by thoughts that are connected underneath. Objects around you don't question their existing cause they don't have a memory. Your hair doesn't question it's existence while growing or dying.  Only we humans question our existence. We associate ourselves with different things around us without actually feeling love. We are in a belief that we love. You don't love your god as much as you love your death cause you're scared. You're afraid your dream will end. You can't feel the love if you're scared. You can only experience godliness/love(not modern version of love) when you realise it inside you. You stop questioning your existence. You're not your memory. You're like foetus in an mother's embryo. You just exist. Birth and death are closest experiences to describe it. You're not the image that the society has built on you. You're not your name or any entity you associate with. Searching for godliness/love is something felt when your remove your memory and connect to the intelligence. You realise there's no you. There's Just I. Not the image you get from seeing my urbanegypsy name but everything that we can ever imagine and cannot imagine. Oneness, I.  Everything in this world is dancing with us (Eternal consciousness) together that can only be felt. This only teaches you living life to the fullest in a most beautiful way you can never imagine. Bringing your best version to this world. You realise you're not just a dot on the timeline but the timeline itself.

My only real exposure to God growing up was saying grace before eating at larger family gatherings. I can still vividly remember the moment I realized 'God was Santa's big brother' as a child. Santa told us to be nice, God told us to be thankful. \n\nI have been, what I call, a practiced atheist. I watched debates, I read books, I built an understanding of what religion, spirituality was and why it was wrong. It was logical and practical, it all made sense. Religion answered questions and made promises. Answers and promises that were wrong. Spirituality to me was simply hippy stuff, and I gave it little to no thought. \n\nI then went to a gathering. I went to meet people and make friends. It was recommended to me by my therapist, who later told me he sent me there because there were things inside me that I had not yet faced. He meant in my life, what I faced instead was much different. It was over a long weekend. It was designed for you to get in touch with yourself. There was a process, there was a sign hung on the wall: 'Trust the Process'. And I did. I went forward with great enthusiasm and I found myself. A self I had lost touch with. I felt free. Free from the constant stream of thoughts that tortured me. I felt loved. A kind of love that I believed could only be felt in a place, a community, like that. I felt the love of all of my family members who wanted so badly for me to belief as they did. I felt the love of everyone in the world, in history, that I had so badly misjudged as delusional with my logic. I felt the pain of all those had been wronged by people who misused this power I didn't know existed, and I sopped, only to be lifted up again by those around me and I felt bliss. \n\nI went home to my loving wife, a believer, and our son. I felt connected to them, in a new way. I talked about the feeling, I talked about the realization. She, of course, already knew. She was old and I was new. I felt that, I believed that. She had already lived in this new world of mine. I felt that she had lived many times in this world, and this was my birth into it. She was an old god and I was an unworthy man at her feet. It was my job to worship her, so I did. She let me in. She deemed me worthy, so I was. \n\nMy wife knew something was wrong. After three nights of not sleeping, murmuring non-sense, fragmented sentences it was decided I would check myself into a hospital. I wrote on the paperwork for reason why, 'I am afraid to go to sleep for fear I will lose the work I have done.' I believed if I went to sleep I would wake up and not remember my experience. At the gathering they said you take with you what you want. I wanted all of it. \n\nIn the hospital I was a visited by angels. Angels to me were the spirits of loved ones in my life being channeled through the patients there. They left me clues, and spoke in code. I felt their love and support on my journey. I did not feel like I could have gotten through it without them. God was speaking to me, through the signs on the doors, the artwork hung on the wall, the shows and movies shown in the common area. I met a man named Adam, he helped me. He told me he had been here before. He was my guide. I learned about myself, I learned about potential futures, I learned what mattered most to me and what I wanted to do. I wanted to help others on their journey, however I could, as Adam helped me. I relived my entire life. Every major decision, every fork in the road I felt I had made a mistake, or regretted my choice. I made the same choices again. Because those choices would bring me back home. To my love: my wife and my son. \n\nI eventually left the hospital, and came crashing back down to earth. After a wondrous and joyful homecoming, reuniting with my family, came a dark depression. A diagnosis of bipolar with psychotic features. The reality that it all was in my head. The anxieties and responsibilities of being a person all came rushing back in with a vengeance. I was left with a divide in my mind, the world and reality I knew and this new experience. But as I grow stronger, and get back to my life day by day I have found that both can be true. The world I have lived in and the world during this journey are one in the same. \n\nThe signs didn't have to be sent to be received. My mind was open and saw what my spirit saw. My loved ones didn't have to be channeled through those around me for me to feel supported and loved by them. The thought of them was enough. My mind was connected with my spirit, my self. I learned how to believe. To know rather than think. It doesn't have to be mystical to be beautiful, to be real. There is power in it, a power I didn't know existed. The power to feel loved. I take that love with me back into my world.\n\nI share my story so that it may help you on your journey, as other's stories have helped me.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 70776, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Atheist to Spiritual Gathering to Psychiatric Hospital to Spiritual Awakening", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e2k1rd/atheist_to_spiritual_gathering_to_psychiatric/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "olivetech223", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4lwxnbpr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574875753, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e2jdlw/what_could_this_mean/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e2jdlw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e2jdlw/what_could_this_mean/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574875757, "score": 1, "selftext": "I've been seeing 10:10 and 12:12 a lot lately would anyone know what this might mean?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 70766, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What could this mean?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e2jdlw/what_could_this_mean/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Alternative-Concern", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_52wgooxb", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574874228, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e2iywx/im_in_such_a_dark_spot/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e2iywx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 19, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e2iywx/im_in_such_a_dark_spot/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574874229, "score": 1, "selftext": "I am not doing well.

I tried to think what it could be and I realised I've just met a person who is seriously ill and has been throughout his life, he's literally an inspiration through what he's achieved despite his illness and I had a gut feeling that this person has come into my life for a reason and that he will leave tragically. You know when you just sense something and know it to be true? Anyways, I had this realisation last night. \n\nThis morning I look at my phone and it was 11:12am so I thought, \"oh, at last! I haven't seen it\" I then realised this friend had messaged me so I opened WhatsApp and under his name it said \"last active 11:11am\" madness. \n\nDoes this all sound connected or am I going crazy? \n\nI need some guidance because surely seeing this number all the time has meaning.

Originally intended it to only be for me, but i want to know if anyone else ever feels the same way. If none of this makes any sense i\u2019m sorry, i\u2019m baked and operating on very little sleep. I\u2019ve been working a lot on a theory of everything (i know, sounds grandiose) but i\u2019m caught up on a paradox in the theory that deals with duality vs nonduality. \n:::\n\nSometimes i get a lot of thoughts. This tends to happen in the evenings, or when i feel creative. Over the past few years these thought have become more uncontrollable at times, maybe every few weeks or months. \n\ni think the reason my thoughts seem to be steadily increasing in volume (amount) in the past few years is because i\u2019ve been obsessed with figuring out who i am and what reality is, and every time i learn something new i become aware of 10 other things i don\u2019t know about. I\u2019m like a browser that\u2019s constantly opening new tabs faster than i can close the old ones. \n\nAnd then i notice a fuck ton of connections between topics, and i get the overwhelming urge to try and come up with a theory to explain why those connections are there. Then im usually not able to justify the connections, and forget about it until i learn another thing that connects to prior set of connections. \n\nNow i have a bunch of sets of connections withib topics including religion, philosophy, math, biology, chemistry, sociology, ancient human civilizations, psychedelics, classified government programs, technology, politics, economics, geology, astronomy, astral projection, spirituality, and physics. And i have a ton of connections between seemingly unrelated topics. I just feel like there are a few big connections missing that, once found, will pull it all together for me. I feel like if i search across the scope of human knowledge, i can find the critical connections that are blocking me from understanding wtf is going on. \n\nLike wtf is existence, experience, the universe. Why tf am i here? Where is here and who am i? I know that millions of the worlds smartest people in history have grappled with this, but none of them had the insane access to information we have now. And unfortunately a lot of the smart people nowadays go to work on stuff like curing disease or running a hedge fund or achieving wealth or power or some other material goal. \n\nI don\u2019t get it. I know i\u2019m not the only person deeply disturbed by the fact that after thousands of years of modern humanity, we still have literally no fucking clue what happening. We like to pretend we do, we have science and technology and can do amazing shit, but no one understands how or why or for what purpose.

We will be Starting Bhagavad-gita Verse by Verse exercise again from 13th Feb 2020.***\n\n***\\*Please write answers to the questions in comments\\****\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**Those who know Me as the Supreme Lord, as the governing principle of the material manifestation, who know Me as the one underlying all the demigods and as the one sustaining all sacrifices, can, with steadfast mind, understand and know Me even at the time of death.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nPersons acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are never entirely deviated from the path of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the transcendental association of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can understand how the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the material manifestation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by such transcendental association, one becomes convinced of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, and at the time of death such a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can never forget K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Naturally he is thus promoted to the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.\n\nThis Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person. The beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is association of persons who are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Such association is spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and, by His grace, one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the Supreme God. At the same time one can really understand the constitutional position of the living entity and how the living entity forgets K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and becomes entangled in material activities. By gradual development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in good association, the living entity can understand that due to forgetfulness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he has become conditioned by the laws of material nature. He can also understand that this human form of life is an opportunity to regain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and that it should be fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord.\n\nMany subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress, the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledge of Brahman, knowledge of Param\u0101tm\u0101, liberation from birth, death and diseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actually elevated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness does not care for the different processes. He simply directly engages himself in activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional position as eternal servitor of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In such a situation he takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotional service. He is convinced that by doing so, all his objectives will be fulfilled. This determined faith is called d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-vrata, and it is the beginning of bhakti-yoga or transcendental loving service. That is the verdict of all scriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the G\u012bt\u0101 is the substance of that conviction.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventh Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Knowledge of the Absolute.\n\n**Question 1 : Why it is very important to associate with a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person

as humanly possible because I didn't want to be dragged out of my bed to be killed or something, it was Soo vivid and real that I would sometimes wake up and still hear the sounds of crawling and stomping around my floor for like a split second during the transition of sleep to being awake and it would happen over and over and never stopped for the whole night, kept experiencing the same thing over and over, and a couple of times when I dreamt this my mom would come into my room and ask me if I was stomping and if I wanted to talk about how I was feeling and I would just tell her that no I wasn't stomping and that I was asleep the whole time, surprisingly she believed me probably because I couldn't talk straight because I just woke up but man that was horrifying, I still fear of having that dream again, I've had many dreams of that caliber but not that vivid and made me terrified when I wake up, tho I still have that dream on very rare occasions but i have been having that dream for

They sat down near a tree they weren't interested in going anywhere, doing anything, becoming prosperous, making a name for themselves, looking for love in all the wrong places. They were interested in one thing, to awaken. They had many interesting experiences books like the Upanishads were written, the Vedas, many other spiritual works that where thousands of years old, giving other people an opportunity and a chance to also discover this truth. When this truth was discovered, they realized they had eternal life. There never was a time when they where born and there would never be a time when they would die. They understood that they are the one! And there is no other, but the one, the screen. They had gone back to the screen, which is consciousness. And they experienced the fact that the body does not really exist it is like the water in the mirage like the snake and the rope like the sky is blue. They became eternal beings, awakened, self realized. Many of these great Sages became teachers, many did not and the message was passed down. \n\n\u2022\n\nIf you want to awaken you have to give up all of your foolishness mentally. You have to stop wanting things, being attached to things. You have to stop worrying about anything and let go of fear. Focus only on the Self, on consciousness whatever you focus on you become. If you desire to focus on things of the world, you become a worldly person. And you go through trials and tribulations, good and bad times, until you learn and understand that this whole world is nonsense. No sense!!! The world has no substance. No reality. The world is without a foundation for it is a mental image. Now take a look at your life. Think of the things that are so important to you. Think of the things that annoy you. That disturb you. Think of the things that make you happy. These are all things. As long as you're dealing with things, they must change. They will never be the same. Nothing is ever the same. Everything must change. Why should you chase after things that change? Don't you see the folly in this? You're wasting your precious life. Then you come back again and again, until you refuse to any longer get involved with this world and you become free! So it is easy to say that the world does not exist. Everything is consciousness, the Self. Yet, if you have not experienced this state, it is foreign to you. If you ponder divine ignorance and ponder the fact that you are really a screen, which is consciousness, something will begin to happen deep inside you. You will begin to let go and your real self will shine through. You are the power. You and you alone are the creator.\n\nI know some of you are saying, \u201cI don't look like a creator, I seem to create hell.\u201d But this is what you do anytime you think! Every time you think you are creating. The world in which you are in right now is a creation of your mind. Whether you're single or married, rich or poor, sick or healthy, all these things are created in your mind, subconsciously. You may say, \"I didn't choose to live this life, I didn't choose these things to happen to me.\u201c Yet, subconsciously you are in that wave length. And everything that is happening to you is suppose to happen. That's what I mean when I say, \u201cEverything is in it\u2019s right place. All is well. Everything is unfolding as it should.\u201d Do not cry over spilt milk. Let go of the past, totally. Forget about the future. See yourself now. What do you see? What you see is what you get. You are more than you can ever imagine. You are the one! Do not be fooled do not allow this universe, the world to shape you and mold you making you believe you are this or you are that. Rather, stand up tall and do not identify with the body or the mind go beyond that. There is really no one on this earth that can hurt you. There is really no one who can do anything to you except if you allow it to happen. Start from the point of divine ignorance. Develop this beautiful humility, this humbleness I was talking about. Admit that you know nothing. Then see yourself as the screen, that takes up all the time and space. And try to realize your humanhood came from this screen. Without the screen, without consciousness you wouldn't be at all. \n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nYou can practice exhaling and the whole universe comes into existence. Inhaling and you suck up the universe in your heart center. This is a very profound exercise to practice. Try it. Inhale feel the whole universe, everything, the stars, the planets, the galaxies, people, places and things - all being consecutive inside your heart. And when you exhale all of creation begins again. It comes out of you. Let's practice this with our eyes closed. Feel this. You and you alone exist. All of this creation comes out of your mind. With every exhalation you are creating the entire universe. With every inhalation the total universe is sucked back into your heart. There is nothing but the Self, the screen. And as you exhale again the entire screen of life becomes covered with images, planets, galaxies and there is movement and life everywhere. And as you inhale all of the movement and all of the life disappears in its entirety and there is only the Self and that is consciousness.

It is a feeling beyond sadness, boredom, or depression, when all finally bares its fangs and one experiences just how deep his own inner void stretches. Every effort of cognition is now a helpless self-attack. Everything invisibly hurts. There's nothing you can do.\n\nPart of the path to finding happiness/peace is to stop despairing, but it's easy to get into questions that bar you from making any headway at all. How can I stop despairing when the world is on fire? When I am unbearably lonely? When I suffer abuse? These are difficult things to answer. Impossible, in fact. The truth is that they all come from the dark parts of your mind, your subconscious, which, when looked at objectively, is nothing more than an evil machine in service of evolution. Your subconscious will trick you for an infinite amount of time, unburdened by guilt, like a psychopathic god pulling your strings. It is bigger and older than your conscious mind, and it knows this. You know this. But now, what do you do with this information? How does one simply stop despairing?\n\nYou stop despairing by coming to terms with the fact that YOU are the psychopathic god pulling your strings and making you suffer. The name of this god is Fear. You were born into it, naked, crying in some doctor's arms and then your mother's. Fear was reintroduced into your life in a multitude of ways. You knew it shortly before you knew Love, unfortunately, so it has stayed dominant, but ONLY with your permission. My point here is that, because all of your problems are perceptions born in the mind, this means that they are all your fault. No, you cannot control the actions of others, but your perceptions have directly caused your agony, not them. Your brain is in constant observation of YOUR actions; it is impartial to the actions of others. You can flip the script and notice, from the perspective of an ego, that most of the time most of us are worried about ourselves and not the outside world. That person whose hand you slightly missed when going for a high five thought of you only briefly before returning to their personal, more immediate problems. You, on the other hand, may have wondered for hours what they thought of you after that embarrassing interaction. The truth, by the way, of this mysterious yet stereotypical nuance of social interaction, is that the other individual simply has a subconscious mind of their own that factored the exchange as evidence for some internal belief they already had formed a long time ago, so they don't really have to think at all about it or you. This doesn't mean you're worthless or irrelevant. It doesn't mean anything except for that our subconscious is constantly filing information into the appropriate folders at light speeds. It's a busy machine, completing an innumerable quantity of tasks twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. You, as you know yourself individually, are just another piece of information being filed and stored.\n\nSo, your despair ends when you hold steadfast the belief that everything you know is your fault, not because you're stupid or evil, but because you're chronically afraid, and that is okay, because from this principal you may then rise to the truth that only you have all the power to change your life into something more meaningful and fulfilling. Your mind is in constant observation of you. Let it observe you acting upon the notion that all your problems are your fault, therefore your (your mind's) responsibility to fix. We are inseparable from our consciousnesses, and it may seem a little difficult to immediately identify with the same thing that's caused literally all of your pain and suffering, but this is part of the process of realizing something pretty cool. The realizing comes with time, along with an elevation in mood and self-esteem. I'm still seeing if this is enlightenment, which is an elusive concept because everyone is always enlightening if you really observe. \n\nI hope this helps somebody. The important thing is not what you THINK--what you hold in your sphere of awareness--but what you do, as this is what your brain is looking for. You can ignore every single thought you have knowing that not one can provide a full truth. Simply walk with the knowledge that the universe is both inside and outside of you, infinite in every direction, so the outside will never look bright if the inside remains dark. It is your (your brain's) responsibility to be happy/content/peaceful/etc without needing any outside stimuli.

Where your higher self assumes the position of the author with a pencil to your thought bubble constantly expanding our knowledge of life outside the pages and then...bam.

No matter how long it\u2019s maintained, the first time it leaves you feel empty. At first you try to convince yourself that it\u2019s still there, you try to manually go on long thought rants continuously talking using words that eventually blend with each other and muffle. The ball isn\u2019t rolling. Now you start to question: \u201cwhat happened?\u201d \u201cWhat the hell did i do wrong?\u201d Even the essence of asking a open ended question seems strange because you were just receiving constant answers. You look at your clock and it says 11:13 you look at your notes in awe of how much you wrote. Page after page of language that seems to have a code you no longer understand.

What goes up must come down and the bigger we are the harder we fall to bounce up even higher. Instead of feeling bad when the knowledge seems to drift away realizing you\u2019ve only just reached a limit that will be shattered upon your next journey upwards. \n\nSorry if this sounded preachy\ud83d\ude29 it\u2019s not purposeful It\u2019s just the culmination of what I\u2019ve been going through this past year and being on the other side of it gives me a sense of urgency to help anyone else who might of had a similar conundrum.

he did bring light into my life. but not in the ways most people described that it\u2019s supposed to happen, it was mainly the feeling he brought me. as if we were destined to meet, as if he was my person. my other half. the feeling was so intense i can barely explain it...\n\nbut yet, he left so soon... he had a lot of problems, it\u2019s been three months... there\u2019s been short communication here &amp; there, he initiated it the first three times, me the last three times... the last time i received no response when i reached out &amp; told him that i never wanted him to leave... i have a strange sense of feeling that it\u2019s \u201cnot time yet\u201d ... those words keep popping into my head, over &amp; over again... whenever i think of needing him back in my life, i hear the words, \u201cit\u2019s too soon.\u201d ... they come to my heart, they reach my soul... it\u2019s so weird. i have never experienced a feeling or connection like this before. this person consumes all of me, even if i want to, i cannot let this person go... it\u2019s been months &amp; they still consume all of me, i have a constant feeling that i must wait for them to come back. it makes me want to rip my hair out. i\u2019m not used to feeling emotions as intense as these. &amp; i don\u2019t know where it\u2019s all coming from, this situation happened as soon as i came more involved in the spirit world (in a good way of course)... \n\nbut this person was everything i was, &amp; a lot of things i was not all in one... but how could it be? i thought a twin flame embodies everything you are as a person... he did to a certain extent, but there were many polar opposites. but the connection was unreal, i just knew this person. this was my person... my heart yearns for this person... i hope that he finds peace within himself. such a beautiful person fighting the darkest demons... &amp; when he does find peace, i hope he comes back to me... i feel the need to communicate with this person, even if it\u2019s just as a friend, it hurts me so that i cannot know if this person is okay every minute like i used to... to not know what\u2019s going on in their life... that i no longer have the right to know how they are, considering we are no longer together... we did not end on bad terms though, they were good. \n\ni have never had this feeling before, it\u2019s not a possessive feeling as in \u201ci NEED this person to be mine again.\u201d - it\u2019s a feeling as in i need this person near me, to know they\u2019re safe, to know they\u2019re okay, i need to stay connected with their soul. it is the strangest feeling. i am so glad i got to experience this, whatever it may be... maybe someone can shed some light on if this was truly my twin flame or not. this person knew everything about me before i even spoke a word. &amp; me the same for him. \n\nEdit: i didn\u2019t know where to add this in &amp; this could be just a coincidence but my twin flames dad has the same birthday as mine does (march 11) dont know if there could be any meaning behind that or not? his sister also had the same name as one of my best friends &amp; his home looked very identical on the inside as my childhood home did, it felt very familiar to me. it was really weird.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 70642, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "is your TF supposed to share personal characteristics as you?

I am not the doer. What comes to me is only an appearance of karma. But I am not that, whether it's good or bad makes no difference. \n\nWho experiences karma? Who experiences human happiness and unhappiness? Who goes through these things? \n\nI do? \n\nThe I is the answer of course. You have a personal identification with I. \n\nAs long as you believe I exist as the body, I exist as  the mind, you'll suffer accordingly. Through all the experiences you go through, some will be good, some will be bad and you will have the yo-yo syndrome.\n\nOne day you'll have something good happen to you, next day something bad, something good will take place all week and something bad will take place for two weeks. Something good will take place for three weeks. It'll go up and down like a yo-yo. Wanting to extend your good experiences and eliminate the bad experiences.\n\nPsychology will not help you. Psychiatry will not help you. Getting stoned out of  your head will no help you. Liquor will not help you. Due to the fact that you've got to awaken from these experiences. All these psychological experiences end, then you're back with yourself.\n\nThe only thing that will help is to find out from where the I comes from. Where does that first pronoun come from, I? It must come from myself when you start to think about it. For it doesn't come from outside of me, due to the fact that every time I say I, I'm referring to myself.\n\nBut what self am I referring to?\n\nWhen I say, \"I am happy, I am sad, I am hungry, I am full.\" Where does that I come from? Who gave it birth? What is its source? \n\nThis procedure is called abiding in the I. You are tracing the I to its source by inquiring of yourself, \"Where did it come from?\" if you like, \"Who am I?\" This is abiding in the I.\n\nYou will soon discover that the I comes to life every morning as you awaken. The I comes to life and it becomes stronger as you go through the day. But if you abide in it, trace it and follow it you will realize that it really has no source. The I is like the water in a mirage. It appears to exist but it's a non-entity. You must discover this for yourself. It will be the greatest discovery you ever make. By discovering this you will have unbounded peace, unalloyed happiness, joy. Just by discovering the I has no source. It never existed.\n\nYou were never born and you can never go anywhere when you die. For there is no where to go. You are that which has always been and which will always be. Sat-chit-ananda.\n\nYou are the ultimate Brahman, pure awareness. That is your true nature. That is you. Not the I. I'm speaking of the personal I. There is no I, but you have to find this out for yourself. This is why in the practice it is said to follow the I to the source which is the spiritual heart on the right side of your chest. When the I goes back into the spiritual heart, it's the same as discovering that the water in the desert is a mirage. This awakens you. When you awaken everything is dissolved.\n\n~ Robert Adams.

I had a really tight knit group of friends, and we were together all the time, I was really content and happy with that part of my life but on the other hand I was abusing alcohol and REALLY wanted a cute and romantic relationship. That pure need for love led me to a very toxic relationship that changed me. The relationship was very intense and I wasn\u2019t allowed to have any friends. If I hung out with anyone (even some family members) my boyfriend at the time would basically disown me or verbally abuse me over it for days. I entered that relationship with trust. I remember during the first month of dating, he told me he was going to hang out with his female friend and I was totally okay with it and trusting. \n\nAfter he got home, he told me that she was all over him (in order to make me jealous) and this was just the start to the manipulation. I don\u2019t really know where it got to this point, but eventually I cut everyone out of my life, I also started hating when he hung out with friends, when I previously wasn\u2019t like that. I left that relationship with one friend that I still trusted. Here I am years later with a new boyfriend who allows me to have friends and live life. The problem though, is that I\u2019m scared to hang out with my friends and have fun because I\u2019m too worried about what he\u2019s doing the whole time. I\u2019m scared to stay out late because I\u2019m scared he\u2019ll start going out with his friends and doing the same and I\u2019ll have to worry if he\u2019ll cheat on me.

And playing videogames could be a good example too.\n\nOn the other hand, Joy comes from within yourself: improving at something you like through frustration and not giving up, working out, eating all clean and healthy, drinking water, practicing abstinence, meditating, facing your fears.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn spite of all the previous, I always feel the urge to buy a video game console everytime it's Black Friday, Steam Summer Bargains or simmilar. Why do I feel this way? I don't know. Maybe I still have attachment towards things that bring me \"pleasure\", and videogames were an important part of my life when I was a kid that wouldn't go outside much and wouldn't do what he wanted to do, wether it was painting, practicing martial arts, learning how to play guitar...\n\nI'd like to spend my money on things that will get me closer to my goals, things that are a part of my \"craft\", my \"life purpose\". But am I restricting myself from something that could not be that problematic?\n\nI want to keep reading books on spirituality, keep training, keep improving my musician skills, keep recordind and writing, keep meditating and studying my body and soul... But I'm not being productive like all the time. I still spend a lot of time just staring at the ceiling with my mind not being in the present moment, it's like I restrict myself from doing something like playing games so I will take advantage of my time, but I don't always take advantage of my time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

However, I am not against gaming at all because many games train you in attributes in which will come in handy in real life. My problem with gaming is it taking over people's lives entirely. When you cease to be of value to the society because all of your time is spent on games, then there is a real problem. However, if one utilises games to improve their abilities while still contributing to the real world, then they are effectively utilising games to improve their character, not take it over.\n\nI love games. The Nintendo Switch Lite just recently came out. It is the console that I have been waiting for my entire life and it even has amazing games such as Skyrim and Witcher 3, all extremely portable. Nintendo now beats all other consoles because they can play the same games now as any other console but all portable. In addition, the Switch has amazing unique titles such as Mario and Zelda that no other console can release. I will be spending the next year collecting amazing titles for this very capable and inexpensive piece of equipment. My life will literally revolve around games, but I will not stop writing and I will not stop studying. In fact, next year I will be starting a Master's degree of Education (Knowledge Networks and Digital Innovation). Games are amazing and have the potential to greatly improve someone's life by giving them experiences that they would not normally be able to experience in real life. When you buy a game, you are buying experiences. And those experiences improve our lives in some way by gaining skills and knowledge in particular fields as a result of the gaming experience. The thing is, life is a game. But most don't realise it and never take the opportunity to play it. As a result, it plays them. Or maybe I should say those who realise that life is a game play the NPCs (fools).\n\nGames with rich stories and voice acting are amazing. They give us the opportunity to live experiences that under normal circumstances we would not be able to experience. The main difference between TV and games are your involvement: your interaction to get the cut scenes to play out. Games are interactive and train your brain whereas television is passive and merely watches other people perform actions. My heart is with those who make their own worlds, not those who live everybody else's worlds. Television and movies have their place, but its true place is mostly turned off. Television is best used to introduce topics and to learn information. Games should be used for your entertainment. The only exception that I would say for this is when the media conveys deep truths about who we are as a society such as South Park. And who doesn't love comedy? Laughing is extremely healthy so we must learn the best pieces of media available to help get our laugh on, and maybe improve society a little in that process.\n\nThe future potential for games and education to merge is limitless. One can easily acquire all the education they require but augmented into a game, so much so that the borders between entertainment and education become indistinguishable. This has not currently happened as most games that are created are merely time wasters. However, the future of games and educating people to obtain meaningful employment is near! Once people realise the educational possibilities with this amazing form of entertainment, the new university's courses will be rolled out, but as meaningful games that train you in the application of many real life skills. The future of education is within games. The future of education is within tricking the students into learning without even realising it. And games give us so many possibilities as we simulate real life, only ever acting as a simulation, meaning that there would be no real world consequences so one is given the opportunity to really test out their new virtual lives.\n\nHowever, any good game takes many developers and voice actors. This is the power of the collective. The collective is amazing and can produce content that would be impossible for one individual to do themselves. But utilising this method empowers the individual from the collective. We have had it backwards all this time. We got the individual to work for the collective when the true health of a society is when the collective works for the individual. And society will work for the individual by providing them games where they make vital decisions that affect the rest of the game world. This will teach us cause and effect and will enable us to develop our moral operandus. We don't want movies and TV. We want interactive movies and television in which our decisions form the stories in which we play.\n\nEven though currently I am placing such a high value on games being active and low value on the passive television zombieing, I want to clear up this confusion before we progress further into the technical details of what I am presenting. There are two sides to every coin. In fact, a coin with only one side is incomprehensible to our human psychologies. Try and fathom one. It is incomprehensible. It is one dimensional and we don't exist in one dimension. Once we add the second and third dimension, left and right; up and down - then we are able to create a scale, hot or cold. Ironically, we feel the same bodily sensations from extreme cold as we would extreme heat: the pain feels the same to be burnt as it would to be to be frozen. A prime example is our far right and far left political systems being practically identical. So our poles we are working with is theory and practice. And for the purposes of this chapter, theory will be passive television watching and practice will be the digital games in which we play. A good example of this would be watching walkthroughs for games in which you are stuck. But one must not limit themselves to one mode of operation. Variety is the spice of life. I watch comedy shows with the humour I enjoy so that type of humour can rub off on my day to day actions as well as within my work. Can you see how this works? We must balance our theory and practice in order to obtain the most enjoyable playthrough in this game we call life.\n\nTo obtain the maximum quality experience in a game, don't try to be somewhere else. Games that force you to play like this are poorly designed. This is a secret that very few people know. If it was commonly understood then most people in our world would be life gamers. The characters we create to pull you into a game will place rather urgency on the main quest line because they are dicks and want you to follow what they want you to follow and quickly. However, there will only be few times within the game in which time is truly of the essence. Thus enjoy where you are and what you are doing: do not strive for some unknown future. Explore the map; solve its puzzles and unlock its secrets. Enjoy grinding when you have to and use it as a chance to explore. Find and play all the minigames. Good minigames have very high replay value, especially if they have multiplayer opportunities.\n\nI envision games that are created to exercise and develop one's moral compass, as an ethics trainer if you will. Good games will be educational at their core. They will trick the player into learning real life skills. Both liniar and non-linear games have great potential, however, I am very attracted to non-linear games. This means many different potential endings based on the actions you make during the game. This gives the character the sense of creating their own destiny as well as greatly enhancing the replay value of the game. Unfortunately though, this is never implemented effectively and the stories feel empty and less fleshed out than a refined liniar game that put great consideration into their one storyline, meaning that liniar games have a better potential to develop more interesting storylines.\n\nIn a game you should learn as you play. The game should introduce you to and teach you new mechanics as you use them. You literally have to learn as you go. Sometimes this can be instructions followed by the player following those instructions. Sometimes this can be immersion, throwing you in the situation and expecting you to learn on your own. However the game teaches you, it is essential that it teaches you comfortably. You should enjoy your experience learning the new mechanics the game is introducing you to. In bad games, you will be unsure of what to do. In good games, you have clear direction about the types of things you could do next. A game should not force you to play in a certain way but allow the player to play utilising their own style in which they created and adapted from the game mechanics. This means that game mechanics should not be too limiting. I don't want to feel like I am playing the same game as every other person in the world. I want my experiences to be unique to me.\n\nGames have the potential to be incredibly unique. Each game does not have to be a copy of another game. Innovation tells us to spend a lot of time on research and development to introduce new game mechanics which other game creators will want to copy. An innovative game is a game that takes parts from other successful games that works and creating unique new game mechanics that make sense. If those mechanics are good enough, then they will be included in many games of the future. The key is to making something that is extremely obvious and works for everybody. The only thing is that oftentimes things like this are not very obvious until after we implement them. It is like the ergonomic designs of controllers, keyboards, or chairs. We make a ton of uncomfortable stuff for years until we realise that it causes long term damage. Now many ergonomic designs feel obvious to us. The standard controller we use across all of our gaming systems feel obvious. But we had to first create and learn the design for these factors to become \"obvious\". The key to making effective game mechanics is making something new that, when used, is obvious. This will not only improve player experience but will also pave the way for new methods of control to be implemented in the future development of educational gaming.\n\nAll games are educational. What they educate upon and whether those learned abilities are transferable is the key. Most modern day games educate on skills that have little to no real world value. Yes, most games develop reflexes. But there is much more to an educational game than mere reflexes. Making games that have transferable skillsets is the future of education. You could even make a game about a computer shop where electronics come in and you have to fix them. This could even go so far as replacing computer chips on a mainboard level. Such a game could be addicting and teach a potential new employee how to do the work of their computer repair shop. Such a game has real-life skills that are directly transferable into our shared reality. And if it is realistic enough, it would give one the skills to be able to do repairs at a computer shop. And skills such as replacing chips on motherboards are skills that are highly needed in this world. There are not enough technicians that work on a mainboard level. And if there were, we would waste a lot less resources, fixing motherboard problems as they arise instead of throwing the entire thing out merely because of a bad chip or bad capacitor.\n\nOne of the worst feelings in a game is not knowing what to do next. This is fun at first as we try to learn what the game wants us to do. But if the game mechanics are not intuitive enough to lead you to a potential next step, then the game was poorly designed. I like games that I can do whatever I want but being stuck in an area is not fun. If you cannot figure out a puzzle or are too weak for your enemies, then you should have the potential to leave that area and go do other things, giving you time to contemplate potential solutions for a future date. Gamers hate being stuck in games. Thus, games should be created to avoid users feeling unsure about what to do next. Oftentimes the best solution to tricky situations is to make a puzzle solvable in multiple ways. Do not force your players to play how you want them to. Allow them to develop their own unique style to playing your game.\n\nGames are not merely restricted to electronic interfaces. The best game we have in front of us is this game called, \"life\". Electronic games are best used as trainers for the game of life. What you do in life, your fate or your destiny, is the main quest line for your game creation. You are the developer for your own game. Unfortunately, copyright can oftentimes make this game difficult when broadcasting to other player and non-player characters. This open world is mostly inhabited by NPCs. However, occasionally on your travels, you will run into other players. This is your opportunity to gain allies for your mission. Other players also have their own personal mission so a mutually beneficial opportunity is what you should be trying to set up with other players. In addition, your romantic partner is also a player. Real people don't want romantic relationships with NPCs. Thus your playing field are players. In this case and currently, there are not plenty of fish in the sea. It will be very difficult not settling with artificial intelligence given the small number of players there are playing this hidden game. You will have to let a lot of beautiful NPCs go, clenching onto the possibility of one day finding your twin flame player. Because if I could find her, then I will have lived the best life possible. Don't settle for trash. You are a treasure hunter.\n\nGood games provide players a unique experience. No run through will be the same as another. However, in saying this, shared experiences are crucial to a successful game. I wouldn't want a game that provided me such a unique experience that I was unable to relate to another gamer's experience in the same game. Thus, I should be able to speak with my friends about a game in which we both had similar shared experiences. Maybe it was a loveable character in the game or an extremely interesting puzzle in which we wish to discuss. I should be able to converse with my friends about the details and they should be able to understand what I am talking about. People are the purpose of this world. And even single player games should be created to be social. The key is implementing the right combination of unique and shared experiences.\n\nI like games where you have to partake in combat. However, our world focuses too heavily on combat games. Sure, you can create whatever world you like and as a result can create a crazy world where everybody is killing each other. However, this is not realistic. Most modern games rely too heavily on combat to obtain and maintain the player's attention. We need to carefully examine our world and what people do for fun in it, and create simulations of it that offer a huge variety of possibilities performing actions to accomplish a goal: real life. A good game might start out with you in your apartment in a city. Combat is a rare thing but you have the option of becoming a martial artist and this then opens you up to the possibility for combat and starts the quest line for the marital artist. The more realistic we make our games, the more realistic application their skillsets provides. I dream of a world where anyone can do anything because the games offered train you in whatever you desire. I see school being replaced by gaming. And this is very possible given our capabilities with teaching within a game. We don't even need to always trick the player into learning. Maybe we should just program a school and in that school you have subjects and you can then learn those subjects wherever you want and your grades for those subjects are stored on your Nintendo University online account...\n\nIt is difficult to say what is bad and what is good with games. Because the same bad technique could be applied to another game in a different way and thus becomes a good technique. But the brainstorming process is integral. Some ideas sound great in theory but do not work practically. Some ideas sound confusing and convoluted, but work brilliantly in practice. The only way to find out is to try it. However, the best of ideas sound great in theory and work great in practice. There is so much future opportunity here because the sky is the limit, meaning there is no limit. Just throw whatever out there idea you have and try it. If it doesn't work, move on to the next idea. Research and development is a long and arduous process. But think innovatively enough and you can create game mechanics that will be so good that they will be adopted by the future standard of our gaming community.\n\nThe potential for role playing games is infinite. Everybody likes playing to unlock new content! How about unlocking new areas? Unlocking new rooms filled with puzzles or even different cities or worlds. Imagine the potential if one unlocked a fully functioning laboratory. What things could I do?\u00a0And maybe I could unlock new things to do in that lab as I explore and collect materials from the the game world. I want a city to call my own. I want a world to call my own. I want worlds to\u00a0call my own. I want lush and beautiful landscapes as well as cities with beautiful and interesting buildings. I want an apartment to call my own where I can hang out and setup and store the items I acquire during my in-game adventures. I want to start off on my feet and as the game progresses, obtain a variety of ways to travel faster and with more excitement, like a horse, car, jet, or dragon. And I want both worlds: fantasy and reality. Thus my asserted theoretical game must include the real and the imagination. Two worlds minimum for me to visit and explore. Huge maps with many regions. I see a game which one would want to play for the rest of their days. I see a timeless game that educates its players on a large and ever expanding variety of topics.\n\nI dedicate this book to all of the children of the world who have lost their lives in a school shooting. What is the point of having a central facility to educate children when you can just hand them a Nintendo Switch and their courses (game cards). The ways in which we educate are about to change drastically. Those in charge know this very well but choose to keep schools around because their parents are working. Grade school has now become a glorified day care centre. The children need to be looked after as their parents work so \"school\" just makes sense. Just remember that by keeping schools around also keeps school violence and massacres around. School needs to change. We need to burn down the buildings. And we need to learn how to educate at home. This does not have to be a difficult task. For one adult could watch a handful of children as they carry out their Nintendo studies. But what we really need to do is trust our children more at home by themselves. They are safer there than they are at school. The question we really need to ask is at what age can we train a child to be responsible enough to be capable of staying at home by themselves or with other children. The problem with our children of today's lack of responsibility is entirely parental, meaning that our children are being coddled so that they stay young and immature for much longer than is biologically required. And if no other solution can be found, you can always have the older children supervise the younger ones. The only reason for modern day schools to exist is out of greed and selfishness. The dinosaur days of our elders is behind us. We are the future. Let's not make the same stupid mistakes as the wicked generations before us did. Let's become something better. Let us evolve. It is called the rapture. Time to ascend!\n\nhttp://nesmith.net/atheden", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 70506, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Game Theory", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e1yzln/game_theory/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "CtrlAltDeleteLife", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1gd14ez0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574775146, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e1xzi2/christmas_gift_ideas_for_my_mum/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e1xzi2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e1xzi2/christmas_gift_ideas_for_my_mum/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574775151, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m not too clued up on the subject of spirituality and such so please excuse my ignorance.

Last night I had what I felt was sort of a breakthrough meditation session where I met my spirit guides and released a lot of fear and doubt. I woke up feeling lighter, more confident, less anxious and my GI symptoms have gone from a 8/10 to a 1/10. I\u2019ve had a small increase in my appetite and I felt very tired around midnight and ready for bed today. I barely got through my manifestations (I\u2019m doing 55x5). \n\nThis was a stark difference from the previous night during which I had so much energy I couldn\u2019t sleep till 5am. \n\nSo tonight I fell asleep listening to a guided meditation on how to attract love/soul mate into my life. I dozed off during the meditation and woke up about 2 hours later to compete silence. I don\u2019t know why but silence always freaks me out. I always have to have some background noise no matter what- even when I\u2019m sleeping. I felt the power of the silence when I woke and decided it happened for a reason. So I continued to try to speak to my guides during the silence. I then tried to speak to my twin flame/soul mate in this dead silence and suddenly I felt so much energy in my upper arms. Almost like restless leg syndrome but in my arms. I had to physically shake it off a few times and I couldn\u2019t even finish meditation because of the intensity of the energy in my arms. Now they feel a bit itchy. Since I stopped meditating the restlessness has almost gone away completely. \n\nCan someone explain why this is happening or what is happening?? I\u2019ve never experienced this before. I feel like it\u2019s too intense with that silence first off. So I tried to put the guided meditation back on and continue and the feeling in my arms persisted so I stopped.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 70477, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New physical symptoms since yesterday- what\u2019s happening to me??

We will be Starting Bhagavat-gita Verse by Verse exercise again from 13th Feb 2020.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**Unintelligent men, who know Me not, think that I have assumed this form and personality. Due to their small knowledge, they do not know My higher nature, which is changeless and supreme.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThose who are worshipers of demigods have been described as less intelligent persons, and here the impersonalists are similarly described. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His personal form is here speaking before Arjuna, and still, due to ignorance, impersonalists argue that the Supreme Lord ultimately has no form. Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya, a great devotee of the Lord in the disciplic succession from R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya, has written two very appropriate verses in this connection. He says, \"My dear Lord, devotees like Vy\u0101sadeva and N\u0101rada know You to be the Personality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures, one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Your activities, and one can thus understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They are unable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be in discussing Ved\u0101nta and the Upani\u1e63ads and other Vedic literatures, it is not possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead.\"\n\nIn the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot be understood simply by study of the Ved\u0101nta literature. Only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only the worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in Ved\u0101nta and speculation on Vedic literature without any tinge of true K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are also less intelligent, and for them it is not possible to understand God's personal nature. Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth is impersonal are described as asuras, which means one who does not know the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from the impersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul-but the ultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead. Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not even follow their great predecessor, \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, who has specifically stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be only the son of Devak\u012b and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerful living entity. This is also condemned in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: \"Only the fools regard Me as an ordinary person.\" The fact is that no one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without rendering devotional service and without developing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The G\u012bt\u0101 confirms this.\n\nOne cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or His form, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing Vedic literature. One must understand Him by devotional service. When one is fully engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, beginning by chanting the mah\u0101mantra-Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare-then only can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has a body made of this material nature and that all His activities, His form and everything, are m\u0101y\u0101. These impersonalists are known as M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b. They do not know the ultimate truth.\n\nThe twentieth verse clearly states: \"Those who are blinded by lusty desires surrender unto the different demigods.\" It is accepted that besides the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have their different planets (Bg. 7.23), and the Lord also has a planet. It is also stated that the worshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods, and those who are devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a go to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka planet. Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists still maintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms are impositions. From the study of the G\u012bt\u0101 does it appear that the demigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods nor K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They are all persons; Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His own planet, and the demigods have theirs.\n\nTherefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that form is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here that it is not imposed. From the G\u012bt\u0101 we can clearly understand that the forms of the demigods and the form of the Supreme Lord are simultaneously existing and that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is sac-cid-\u0101nanda, eternal blissful knowledge. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme Absolute Truth is \u0101nandamaya, or full of blissful pleasure, and that He is abhy\u0101s\u0101t, by nature the reservoir of unlimited auspicious qualities. And in the G\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that although He is aja (unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we should understand from the G\u012bt\u0101. We cannot understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of the impersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the G\u012bt\u0101 are concerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has both form and personality.\n\n**Question 1 : Who are M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b's/impersonalists ? What is their philosophy ? How their philosophy has been rebutted in this verse ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/e1vapx/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_724/)", "send_replies": true,

I was in some of kind of a resting chamber, not frozen, but in like a coma. Present day a memory od this future me : family and friends were all around me, resembling vibrant aliens with wings, tails and scales. I felt it was how we'd engineered ourselves in whatever fashion one saw fit to inhabi;. The line between reality and fantasy blurred. Again, I was in a coma and there was some sense of alarm that I had to wake up in this future self or I woould die. \n\nSomewhat still grounded in the present, I saw plants in a new enhanced way I had never before. Could see our exchange of energy, a wafting airy mist that radiated from their cells. The winter snow felt magical for once.\n\nWhen people would walk past by me, they were both in slow-motion but quick too, like a blur and they left trails of their energy signature behind that I could still sense... like I myself was buffering from many realities at once. \n\nI was under the impression that the thoughts of others were like magnets and by tapping into a calm meditative state, these thoughts become tangible, able o be accessed. \n\nIt was a whirlpool, a cacophony of senses that swept me away into a state of euphoria and ecstash.

Anyway, I'm constantly reading and researching about spirituality, but I just can't incorporate it into my life, just to lazy I guess.\n\nI have been seeing angel numbers for months now. Whenever I check the time or look at my phone battery I see 11:11, 66% etc. I see all  the numbers through 1-9 except 8, maybe it's because 8 is my numerology number according to my birth date.\n\nAnyhow, lately I've been feeling unbalanced, both in life and my body. I don't feel well, I'm constantly anxious, tired, I've been spacing out, I'm inpatient, quiet, I've been feeling kind of \"foggy\", not eating well.

She imposed helping me with tasks in a way that was domineering and with intention for me to submit to her. I found that at first I became defensive towards her until I realized that is what she wanted so instead I thanked her profusely for her 'help', engaged with her very little when she barged in a conversation or simply walked away when she interrupted me speaking to another coworker. \n\nSunday- A former partner and I have had inconsistent contact for 4 months. I spoke to him last a week ago. He has contacted me 4x since and I have not responded to any of his inquiries frankly because I have been focused on my spiritual journey very strongly this week. I have received so many nods from the universe this week. Yesterday, he sent me a message reading \"are you ignoring me? if so, I don't know why.\" And I feel that it is a very manipulative tactic to force me to answer him right away because HE wants it. Yet I dont want to answer him just yet. I still havent yet either.\n\nMy question is , do I continue ignoring him or do I tell him that Im going through something and am not able to respond?

Such a great soul is very rare.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe living entity, while executing devotional service or transcendental rituals after many, many births, may actually become situated in transcendental pure knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of spiritual realization. In the beginning of spiritual realization, while one is trying to give up one's attachment to materialism, there is some leaning towards impersonalism, but when one is further advanced he can understand that there are activities in the spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotional service. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can understand that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's mercy is everything, that He is the cause of all causes and that this material manifestation is not independant from Him. He realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is a relationship with the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus he thinks of everything in relation to V\u0101sudeva, or \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such a universal vision of V\u0101sudeva precipitates one's full surrender to the Supreme Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare.\n\nThis verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter of \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad: \"In this body there are powers of speaking, of seeing, of hearing, of mental activities, etc. But these are not important if not related to the Supreme Lord. And because V\u0101sudeva is all-pervading and everything is V\u0101sudeva, the devotee surrenders in full knowledge.\" (Cf. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 7.17 and 11.40)\n\n**Question 1 : What are the realizations of a transcendentalist who has the reached the ultimate goal of life

powerful. Through the ages of 15 to 25, I'd managed to cultivate a healthy way of life that is both healing and enjoyable . Our thoughts truly create us, and after the fog had been lifted, I'd begun to walk the days away, eat healthier; foods full of nutrition and smoke a little #weed, experiment with #magicmushrooms; restoring life to the intricate web that is the psyche. I'd quickly forgetting my old life as a depressed teenager with social anxiety, nihilism and atheism. Now I had a spirit, a joy and fervor to enjoy all that life has to offer. #Miracles began to happen left and right. Overtime this quickly escalated, to #euphoric and #ecstastic levels of #mania and I was shortly after hospitalized after my first big #spiritualawakening . What doctors saw as psychosis, I saw as renewed meaning and purpose. I was injected with #abilify and it made me physically sick. It stifled my growth, but the silverlining was understand #psychology from the inside out. I learned from my fellow patients, the hardworking #nurses and seemingly arrogant (and ignorant) #psychiatrists . Conciousness, dreams, and the #soul are still a #mystery . I WILL NEVER STOP HEALING,, and will forever advance my artistic abilities, physique and freshen my view on life time and time again, even when it seems pointless. I love every version of myself, and the #past is but a #memory a #guide amd #roadmap to new heights and #sensations  using whatever life throws at me to learn.

We\u2019re pretty serious, we live together and plan on getting married eventually. I was raised in a very traditional, strict catholic home-and I think I began to resent my parents and our religion because of how limited I felt by it. I had no choice in how I wanted to live, everything religious was forced upon me and my siblings. Mass at least once a week, sometimes in Latin, catholic schools, we couldn\u2019t watch the same tv shows our friends were, my mom even made me dress up a saint for Halloween. Once I left for college and became independent, I strayed away from the church. If I ever went, it was mainly because of the guilt of not going. My lifestyle now would be so frowned upon by the church because I live with my boyfriend and don\u2019t really bring Jesus into my life at all. \nMy boyfriend has never shown any interest in religion or anything spiritual at all, it doesn\u2019t even cross his mind. He was raised Christian but never went to church even on Christmas or Easter\u2014his family prays before dinner but that\u2019s about it. And I\u2019ve even made fun of my family with him for being so religious. Unlike him, I\u2019m a very introspective person and have many unsettling questions about the world and I think I just feel completely lost and empty without any kind of meaning in my life. I don\u2019t know if I miss how Catholicism gave life meaning and purpose, or if there is some other spirituality I\u2019m longing for. \nI\u2019m worried that if i realize that I want to go back to the church, it would push him away and make him uncomfortable. I know he would support whatever I want to do, but I also am pretty sure he would have zero interest in doing anything religious with me. \nI want my life to have purpose and I feel so lost acting like I don\u2019t care about why were here or why we do anything. I don\u2019t know if I could go on like this or if I want to, which also scares me because I won\u2019t want to marry him and spend the rest of my life with someone who doesn\u2019t have any spiritual longing.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 70289, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Worried about losing my relationship if I want to become religious again", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e1de38/worried_about_losing_my_relationship_if_i_want_to/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "emmastar4", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_52x4pnd5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574668633, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e1cu9j/how_spiritual_are_you_and_what_are_spiritual/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e1cu9j", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e1cu9j/how_spiritual_are_you_and_what_are_spiritual/", "pinned": false, "removed_by": "moderator", "retrieved_on": 1574668633, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 70279, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How spiritual are you and what are spiritual practices in your country ?

Firstly I'd like to say that I started having my spiritual awakening a couple of weeks ago. And I'm beginning to see the truth.\n\nSo there were a lot of things I've realised but this one thing is still kinda bothering me. What is being yourself. Let me start by saying humans have evolved to a point where they all are patterns. Programs who can live about their life without being aware basically even if you remove the consciousness of them they can still follow the and live as per the patterns. I've beginning to notice my patterns lately even though the pillar of awareness is still being cemented I see I'm heading towards the right direction. \n  So if being a certain pattern is being yourself then yourself is unconscious. It's what causes pain and suffering I feel. I honestly think two people fitting in together is basically a very unconscious thing in the modern world. A very pattern based connection where the consciousness plays a very little role. It's hard to find a connection between two or more people who take a concious step accepting each other no matter how different they are.

I\u2019ve ready many personal development and self help books and grown my tool set to get through hard times and really enjoy the good.\n\nI wanted to share one of my biggest break throughs in hopes that it helps someone on this subreddit :)\n\nMany gurus talk about gratitude being the key to happiness/positive frequency. They talk about listing things you\u2019re grateful for and keeping them in mind throughout your day. But that never really helped me. I would always say \u201cok, I\u2019m grateful for air. I\u2019m grateful for my apartment. Im grateful I have friends/family. I\u2019m grateful I have money, etc.\u201d and it felt like a chore to list all of these things off. Ya I felt a little more at peace but I didn\u2019t get how this helped people so much.\n\nUntil it clicked one day. Instead of just listing off a number of things to be grateful for, pick one thing AND DIVE INTO GRATEFULNESS. Embody it. Fully feel the depth of your love. Let\u2019s say, for example, a parent: \n\nI\u2019m so so so thankful for my mother. She is truly an amazing and intelligent woman and I\u2019m so grateful that she raised me the way she did. She worked over full time to support me and my brothers. She cooked for us every night. She always gave us advice when we needed it and tried to always make us happy. She saved up for months to buy us a go cart when I was 10 and spent the whole day watching us and showing us how to operate it. She always let us open one present on Christmas Eve because she knew how excited we were for Christmas and our joy brought her joy. She helped my brothers and I purchase our first car(s). She taught us how to love other people despite our differences. \u2014 i got emotional writing this! Haha\n\nDig up memories you have that make your heart feel radiant and full. Really feel the love that you feel or have felt in those memories. Paint the scene in your head.\n\nMaybe this is a no brainer for some of you, but for me it was like a huge slap in the face. I take time every morning now thinking of a deep friendship I have or a family member I love. I feel my whole body fill with warmth and love and appreciation. I have noticed a MONUMENTAL difference in the quality of my days. My attitude is 99% positive. I smile more. I notice the good WAY more than the bad. And it takes about 30 seconds. \n\nAnyway, I hope this helps at least one person and I\u2019d love to hear some of your favorite ways to start the day off right!\n\nI truly love all of you and I hope you\u2019re kicking ass on your own spiritual journey!\n\nXoxo", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 70244, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Gratitude: in depth", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e1ba5l/gratitude_in_depth/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Imagonit", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2aqxgov5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574657710, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e1b163/does_a_meaning_in_life_exist/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e1b163", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e1b163/does_a_meaning_in_life_exist/", "pinned": false, "removed_by": "moderator", "retrieved_on": 1574657714, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 70236, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Does a meaning in life exist?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e1b163/does_a_meaning_in_life_exist/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "xxeta", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4cni3wvq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574657623, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e1b0o9/dealing_with_the_impermanence_of_life/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e1b0o9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e1b0o9/dealing_with_the_impermanence_of_life/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574657626, "score": 1, "selftext": "For the last few months I\u2019ve been really struggling to accept the transient nature of life.

Later adoption of the Abrahamic faith by erstwhile pagan societies (like Christianity, Islam) recognize that the struggle is not against the flesh but end up embracing the notion of \"heck\". Modern Islam now removed from early Jewish texts (they used to read the Tanakh) may espouse \"Jahanam\". \n\n**It would be interesting to find out if there are any other schools of thought which embrace the aforementioned or any punitive measures as a tool for reform.**\n\nWhat is the solution if it is not punitive ?

I recently made a video to help heal your inner-child. If anyone has done any inner-child healing in the past they know how important this form of healing is to remove the faulty programming that was conditioned in to us as children. As well, this form of healing will help you love yourself more so you can recover from absent or non-existent emotional supports in your childhood. This meditation will begin with a general clearing of your energy body. It will then locate the source of all your faulty programming and pains and then remove them. Next I will guide you to a place where your inner-child can stay protected from the individuals who hurt them in the first place. Finally, this mediation will end with the growing of a beautiful golden tree in order to help you grow and overcome any weakness that you may have. \n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j46rNE2KUK4&amp;amp;t=4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j46rNE2KUK4&amp;amp;t=4s)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 70220, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Inner child healing", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e19w2z/inner_child_healing/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "effluententropy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4vv6897s", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574650684, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e19n02/consciousness_as_a_developmental_integral_system/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e19n02", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 16, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e19n02/consciousness_as_a_developmental_integral_system/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574650686, "score": 1, "selftext": "this is just a llil thought i have. i believe all things in the universe are conscious, animism. in that you can see your consciousness as sort of a cluster of energy which relays quantum feedback and that\u2019s precisely what i believe consciousness to be. to further add on, you can\u2019t get a rise of consciousness from something;

They have a specific energy attached to them in terms of their own personal wisdom. For example, the Pig - she loves to eat her fill, sleep with company, and roll around in that which pleasures her most: mud. The pig knows much about taking care of the self and loving her body.\n\nTherefore, if she was presented to me, I would take a good hard look at how I was taking care of myself. More often than not these animals show up to offer us wisdom when we cannot see ourselves that we\u2019ve ventured off the path. \n\nIt also depends on how they decide to present themselves. This will offer you more insight into what aspect of your life you should apply this wisdom. Another example:\n\nOne day I was walking downtown in the city, surrounded by people - rush hour. I stopped by a tree to check the time and noticed a crow, chilling on the sidewalk beside me. \n\nHe was walking in what seemed to be an aimless manner, just circling and stopping to check a few people out. I noticed that he walked strangely, and then that his foot must have been broken at some point, because it was essentially sideways. But he walked on it just fine so it must have healed. \n\nLater on, I thought of the crow. He is a marker of intelligence through his skilled use of tools. he also has an incredibly sharp perception, a key for clarity. I thought of the nature of his presence, of how he was swimming in a crowd aimlessly, and of his healed - but broken - foot. And it was during a time where I was feeling lost within my own sense of balance, as well as troubled by other people\u2019s actions. \n\nEnlightenment! I realized that the crow had told me that we are all alike. We are all aimlessly wandering in a crowd, in and out of other\u2019s lives. Each of us search for purpose without knowing exactly what it might be. And, we have all been broken, so  - healed or not - our personal sense of clarity and wisdom will always be slightly out of balance. \n\nThis helped me greatly at the time. I began to stop taking other people\u2019s judgements upon me personally, for everyone has been broken, and is only trying to understand the world and others through their inherently broken sense of perception. I also started to focus on my personal sense of justice and tried to push it back into balance and further towards clarity. \n\nI hope this helps outline how to interpret animal energies in your daily life. Sometimes, it might take days to understand a message.

I was at a point where I would have no dreams for about a year. Recently my dreams have come back. \n\nToday around noon I was lying down and watching a documentary on quantum theory. By the end of the documentary I begin to doze off and had a sense I was falling into sleep paralysis. \n\nThe Dream \n\n\nI was in a house that I did not know, I was up in an attic looking inside a treasure chest. The contents in the chest were collectors items of some sort propped up on styrofoam. The items were a house, boat, and something I didn\u2019t recognize. I took the items and left the house and ended up on a grassy hill that wads in the middle of the apartment complex I actually live in. On the hill were a bunch of people walking there dogs. A lady with a golden retriever came up to me and I attempted to pet it because I said to myself \u201cdogs are my spirit animals.\u201d As soon o reached out to pet it, a black dog with growling green eyes jumped out in front of it. I fell down on the ground and the dog and I stared at each other for a long moment. I waited for it to attack me but it just looked at me with a smirk/menacing but also amused expression. After a moment I told myself not to show fear or it will attack me. I stood up and forced myself to slowly walk away. It did not follow me and as I was walking I ran into two women that resembled one of the women that lives in my real life apartment complex. She told me she was trying to see the name on the plaque I carried and I looked down and noticed it was the name of my ex husband and,  I also had the styrofoam and a few pieces from the collections from trunk in the house. We chatted for a few moments about my separation from them and then they disappeared. I turned to my right with empty hands and a tall older white man was staring at me with a sinister smile, he had the leash of the black dog from before whose eyes were glowing a even bright green and he was smiling with full teeth. I looked at them both for what felt like forever until I walked forward. I came up to the leasing office of my apartment complex where my neighbor and two handymen were digging up dirt. My neighbor who knows me in real life had on pink garden gloves and she appeared to be clearing a path of some sort. She asked me if she knew about someone that I know in real life but she wouldn\u2019t say their name. All she said is \u201cI\u2019m worried about Kansas.\u201d \n\nThe dream ended and I woke up.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 70166, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can someone please help me interpret this dream.

But it was so vivid in my mind sometimes I could recall and predict what is about to happen next. But because of the family religious beliefs I was never taken seriously and was ridiculed. Over time I did everything to hide my experiences. Now as an adult I'm still experiencing things but this time I'm seeing shadows or blobs everywhere and sometimes hearing distance chatter.. it's always loud enough I can hear the noise of the voices but can never hear what's being said. I do know what ever this is doesn't intend to harm me. I think this because whatever I'm going threw I've been going threw it my entire life.

I also have to heed the feelings, and am vigilant about allowing and acknowledging and accessing my body and my heart\u2019s sense to inform and guide perceptions and perspectives \u2014 otherwise, I\u2019m just trying to do what Google does, but without a soul. There\u2019s no point. Data and information are essential, but critical thinking, systems and contextual examination, and emotional discernment color in the rest of the structure and reality construct. Meaningful existence requires elements of the whole recipe.\n\nIn that light, as I go through the process of reading, researching, learning, listening, writing, editing, and simply living my life, I can feel something of a grander cohesive energy of understanding that slowly emerges outside and beyond the traditional and adopted narratives that are common and popular. The headlines, trending topics, latest and greatest and scariest stories are generally of elementary and base-level energy. Most people everywhere are worried about and talking about the same things. These concerns are certainly valid, but it\u2019s evident that the vast majority don\u2019t readily consider much of anything beyond the minor bubble reality they live in day-to-day. Invariably, their worldview is dramatically distorted by mainstream narratives and an adopted (force-fed) sensemaking.\n\nWhat\u2019s also evident is that there is a vast groundswell of activity happening in relatively quiet, persistent, evolving ways that is fundamentally shifting the global narrative. Consciously aware and very intelligent, creative, passionate, community-minded individuals and organizations are working diligently within and outside of the rigid, outmoded, and outgoing world systems. New systems and designs for governance, finance, education, and regenerative practices in agriculture, industry, technology, and commerce are being developed by next-level consciousness all over the world. Many are aware of the need and are intent on bringing about a kind of civilization upgrade \u2014 while others are quite sure that much of what we are experiencing around the world in this era is proof of the inevitable and complete collapse of everything.\n\nI can appreciate both sides of the argument, and they\u2019re both valid. But we need to elevate ourselves beyond these mindsets. In a time when it\u2019s all too easy to become polarized and defensive, that, to me, is all the more reason to remain open, flexible, adaptable, growing, learning, and developing personally \u2014 be it spiritually, emotionally, philosophically, or psychologically. The way in which we perceive the world is directly translated through our varied filters and conditions and programs. The more we adhere to strict and fixed and rigid guideposts, the more we risk breaking ourselves by them. Undoubtedly, we will develop and live by some sort of reliable (or at least well-practiced) belief system. However, I believe it\u2019s critical to examine our core values and beliefs so that we abort the mission that is determined to propel us all into oblivion.\n\nI am a huge fan of science fiction (Trekkie for life!). What\u2019s always inspired and uplifted me are the progressive, positive, evolved, and enlightened futures envisioned, rather than the dystopian, apocalyptic, humanity-is-doomed narratives. Sure, we\u2019ll always have things to figure out and we\u2019ll fail, stumble, and fall. But, it\u2019s very easy, and very lazy, to predict and assume that it\u2019s all going to hell, should we be left to our own devices. I can\u2019t really comprehend why there\u2019s such a persistently heavy, negative bent that weighs on much of our modern society, when anything and everything beautiful and amazing and life-affirming is possible. If there is indeed an agenda to keep humanity dumb, daft, and ignorant, it has certainly been effective\u2026 for millennia. But, it is merely one narrow-minded, disgusting, perverted agenda, and but one possibility in a universe of infinite potentiality.\n\nThat\u2019s the truth. That\u2019s what I hold on to. That\u2019s what inspires me to write, explore, re-think, examine, and discover \u2014 and to grow as a person and as a man. We have barely begun this leg of our human journey, and it\u2019d be a damn shame if we left our fates in the hands of the emotionally inept, psychologically dysfunctional, ideologically backward; the egomaniacal fundamentalists, politicians, bankers, and the so-called elite. These entities represent the smallest fraction of the greater species. Let\u2019s remember that.\n\nThe old world is dying and the old systems are falling apart. This upheaval and cross-cultural, trans-societal reorientation is a critical step in our collective evolution. It\u2019s time now to step up and see with new eyes, and an open heart. Listen, learn, grow, adapt, expand, build communities, build resilience, and build better systems from the ground up.\n\nIt\u2019s what you\u2019re here to do and to be a part of. Let it terrify you. Let it inspire you. You don\u2019t have to go far because right in your own back yard, in your office, in your classroom, or on your stage or platform, there are endless opportunities for engagement with people of similar or like minds that would be open (perhaps reluctantly at first) to discuss, debate, define, design, and implement systemic improvements that will benefit us, our children, and the generations beyond them.\n\nGrand designs are incepted with one idea and are propelled, developed, and refined by the authentic, bold, caring and courageous. The more we invite both contrasting and complementary perspectives \u2014 with the underpinning of love, unity, and collective betterment \u2014 the more swiftly we can move into alignment with that which bubbles underneath.\n\n*Solvitur ambulando*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5",

Hope this is the correct reddit group, but I need to learn more about something that I've experienced over the last year. \n\nFirst thing - Time.\n\nStarting around August last year, I started noticing an interesting pattern when it comes to TIME. I constantly see the time as something: **20**. Eg, 10:**20** / 19:**20** / 20:**20** / 1:**20** etc etc. Always 20. \n\nAt first I thought it's just coincidences, but then it started occurring with different things, eg: I'd get new business enquiries from a potential client - email gets sent at exactly 12:**20** (I'm a freelance software developer). Or I got my first customer for my little software that I built - the payment of $36 came through at exactly 11:**20**. \n\nWhen I booked flights to visit my girlfriend a few months ago, never looked at the time in detail of the flight cause it's long haul flights and the specific airline always departs around midnight from my hometown - on the day when I printed ticket, it shows departure time is 12:**20**am. \n\nI'd leave my phone for hours and then suddenly look at it, only for the time to be something:**20**. \n\nI still see it everywhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond thing:\n\nThere's been a lot of coincidences the last year, but this week alone, I experienced the following.\n\nAfter spending 6 months with my girlfriend travelling around South East Asia, I decided I'll come back to South Africa to visit my parents - also, my grandfather got diagnosed with lung cancer, so my dad thought it would be good if we're around for Xmas. She went back to Japan to visit her family.\n\nMy parent's house / childhood house is in a neighbourhood in a subtropical part of South Africa. Lots of wildlife here, huge birds (especially falcons, eagles, ibis's, etc) and a lot of monkeys, snakes etc.\n\nI was sitting on our balcony talking to my girlfriend on Facetime and she could hear a hadeda ibis calling in the background. We started talking about different birds and she asked if I've ever seen an owl here. In my 15 years living here, I've never seen an owl in the area, so presumed we don't have owls here. \n\nThe following night as I was driving home after having dinner with the family, we all saw and witnessed a giant owl just down the street from our house. Honestly! What's the odds??? Another huge coincidence. Literally a day after I said I've never seen an owl here before. \n\nThe other coincidence, a on Thursday morning I installed a few developer things on my laptop. One of the packages that automatically installed was called \"Crypto.Cipher\" (used to encrypt passwords). While I've seen the Cipher package many, many times in the past, that morning it grabbed my attention and I decided to google the package as well as the word Cipher for its meaning - a secret or disguised way of writing.\n\nA few hours later, a client messaged me and invited me for a cup of coffee. Sure thing, so I met up and we discussed some work like usual. Afterwards, we chatted about other things completely off topic and unrelated to work. It was about some tv show about pirates and treasure hunting and he mentioned pirates wrote down the location of the treasure in \"Cipher\" that professionals have to decode.\n\nAnother coincidence - I could've learnt the word \"Cipher\" any other day in the past, yet it only came up today - and then it came up, twice.\n\nAm I over thinking the coincidences?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 70127, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Too many coincidences over the past year", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e11wtw/too_many_coincidences_over_the_past_year/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Philosopher-Newport", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3lys2c0h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574617981, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e11tlm/what_is_sleep_what_is_it_really_philosopher/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e11tlm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Video"}], "link_flair_template_id": "a73e23e6-841b-11e7-95a2-0ec544fa7318", "link_flair_text": "Video", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e11tlm/what_is_sleep_what_is_it_really_philosopher/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574617982, "score": 1, "selftext": "If you met someone who had never slept a moment in their life, how would you explain it?

That the truth is relative to the individual, not the whole. To satisfy your analytical mind, we\u2019d like to remind you of the \u201cObserver Effect.\u201d\n\n( Dave interjecting here just incase you weren\u2019t familiar\u2026 Scientists are discovering that they affect the outcome of experiments just by observing them: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/02/980227055013.htm )\n\nSkepticism often comes from the idea of defending yourself from deception.

The path of power (your purpose), the path of love, and the path of truth. Choosing to pursue the path of love or the path of truth will turn into a nightmare if you don't pursue the path of power first.\n\nImagine owning an advanced toy robot, but not having the batteries it requires to function. Although you don't have batteries for the toy, you can still fall in love with its beauty and uniqueness. You can also speculate on all the functions you think it can perform. However, it's not until you put batteries in the robot that you will know exactly what it can do and enjoy interacting with it. If you can\u2019t obtain batteries for this robot, then the love you have for it will wither away and your speculations will turn into frustrations, as you will never know what the robot can do. Afterward, you will most likely find yourself going towards the next thrill because the robot only stands on the shelf. The truth of the matter goes from your owning an awesome toy, to owning a dust-collecting shelf-decoration. If I were to replace \u201ctoy robot\u201d with \u201cyour life,\u201d the parameters would be similar. Without power, you would coexist with limited potential, and your truth will remain unknown. Your co-creators would appreciate you as they see fit and label you as they deem appropriate because you don't express anything. Only until you have personal power will you be able to express in your unique way, and behold evidence of your truth. Until you realize and reveal your own power, you will merely exist in this world.\n\nIf you pursue the path of love above power, then all your relationships with your co-creators will never satisfy you as you move through life feeling empty. You will never appreciate others until you can appreciate your contributions and purpose in life. You will never feel you deserve the love and appreciation of others because you won\u2019t understand why you are loved and appreciated. You won't understand why you are loved until you love who you are and how you express who you are. You won\u2019t love who you are until you are genuinely proud of the inner power within you and proud of how you contribute your power to the world. You will appreciate your contributions when they derive from the foundation of your core personal power. This is the core power within you that will be found when you follow your passions. Until you can find your core power and contribute as the person you were meant to be, you will never feel good enough. You will sabotage all of your relationships and situations because no one and nothing will ever be good enough. This is because, instead of finding and expressing the power within yourself, you seek to fill a void from outside yourself. This is a void that cannot be filled by someone else. Only your personal power can fill it. The expression of your true inner power is the part of the puzzle that determines the quality of the overall experiences you take part in.\n\nIf you pursue the path of truth over power then you will also end up frustrated if you look outside yourself for the answers. This is because, as you seek the answers to your questions, you will find endless new questions for every speculation and theory you concoct. Each one of these questions has many answers leading to more questions with many answers towards infinity. Each of life\u2019s questions and problems contain a plethora of solutions. One of those solutions within the infinite sea of answers involves the contribution of your personal power, which is your unique thumb-print solution. There is one solution from the many, for each problem, that belongs to you because it is meant for you. That said, unless you find your personal power, every answer you find that doesn\u2019t involve your unique expression will leave you feeling empty. All truths are half-truths, so it is best to find and only focus on the side of every truth that is yours. Everyone else's truth is already occupied by everyone else.\n\nThat said, you must realize your power which can only be claimed at this very moment you are currently in. If time is the curse of humankind, then being in the moment will shield you from this curse because that's where your power is. Wherever your attention may be is where your energy and power will go. Your intentions can only exist right now because time doesn't exist. Every time you have an intention, a plan, or a purpose, you are here, right now, at the moment. Stay in your intentions, and you will always stay in the moment.\n\nMotion without intention happens when you lose the moment and are mentally somewhere else, while moving now. The problem with this is you always manifest unless you are asleep. This means that considerable harm can happen to you if you aren't deliberate. Motion gives power, and you are losing power if you are in motion without any present intention to guide you. Therefore, it is always the wiser choice not to give your power and energy until you have intentions for a direction. For you to decide on a path requires your intentions. It takes intentions to deliberately manifest with satisfaction. Intention and motion need always be kept together like a salt and pepper shaker.\n\nWhen I look around, I see that power is being carelessly dispersed and being readily received with no effort whatsoever from somewhere or someone. This is being done without your knowledge and little compensation because you are distracted. If I were an evil entity and wanted to farm the human race, I would keep things as they are. I would continuously distract you to persuade your minds to live somewhere else as your bodies move in the present so that I can steal the fruits of your hard labor. I would do this to stop you from figuring out that your purpose is to fill your basket with the fruit you cultivated. If you move through life distracted, then by the time you understand your purpose, it's way too late to act on it. The fruits are gone, and you are too tired to keep going, as you are disposed of. The \u201cfarmers\u201d would then convince the younger generation to follow in your footsteps. That said, you need to stop being a zombie. Use your power, or it will be taken from you! \n\nThe more you know your own truth, the more you will be able to recognize the truth because you will have a very stable reference point within yourself. It is only until you have obtained a robust personal power, and have empowered others with it, that you will be surrounded by love and a truth that is sweet. If your personal power and/or the expression of your power is lacking, then your truth will be unfulfilling, and love will be a dream. Whatever path you choose to take that is absent of your personal power will be a decision to short-sell yourself and live a mediocre life. \n\nGodspeed", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 70072, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Your First Choice MUST Always Be To Choose Your POWER!", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e0xjvo/your_first_choice_must_always_be_to_choose_your/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DamienDUBOIS", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_52rxrxii", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574589796, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e0womf/one_hour_of_free_reiki_music/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e0womf", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e0womf/one_hour_of_free_reiki_music/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "HMjkakCNmJg2d_jV75_ph8tIyOT_qwtZNzbptX896Co", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/UBCKDThFd45BJ4--aekwl8f1kYnvPZd5hW5k2nsutgA.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23a8498a9c7fa24e30b4db818447e7a701ff7117", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/UBCKDThFd45BJ4--aekwl8f1kYnvPZd5hW5k2nsutgA.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d08d9e15df2826f7f4445cc2600b7b2ecb0b6595", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/UBCKDThFd45BJ4--aekwl8f1kYnvPZd5hW5k2nsutgA.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c072c2af677a72ffcbae7008b208bf59cba562d4", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/UBCKDThFd45BJ4--aekwl8f1kYnvPZd5hW5k2nsutgA.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=62985996bcc76035e27370f797dc1401885e81bb", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "removed_by": "moderator", "retrieved_on": 1574589802, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 70057, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "One hour of free reiki music", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e0womf/one_hour_of_free_reiki_music/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "skatelife97", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1g6xvyhc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574583818, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e0vwm4/yearning_to_feel_her_presence/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e0vwm4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 18, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e0vwm4/yearning_to_feel_her_presence/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574583821, "score": 1, "selftext": "I don\u2019t really know...

Everything rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThere is a common controversy over whether the Supreme Absolute Truth is personal or impersonal. As far as Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is concerned, the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and this is confirmed in every step. In this verse, in particular, it is stressed that the Absolute Truth is a person. That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also the affirmation of the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25; that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure, Govinda, and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These authorities leave no doubt that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. The impersonalist, however, argues on the strength of the Vedic version given in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad: tato yad uttaratara\u1e41 tad ar\u016bpam an\u0101maya\u1e41 ya etad vidur am\u1e5bt\u0101s te bhavanti athetare du\u1e25kham ev\u0101pi yanti. \"In the material world Brahm\u0101, the primeval living entity within the universe, is understood to be the supreme amongst the demigods, human beings and lower animals. But beyond Brahm\u0101 there is the Transcendence who has no material form and is free from all material contaminations. Anyone who can know Him also becomes transcendental, but those who do not know Him suffer the miseries of the material world.\"\n\nThe impersonalist puts more stress on the word ar\u016bpam. But this ar\u016bpam is not impersonal. It indicates the transcendental form of eternity, bliss and knowledge as described in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 quoted above. Other verses in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad substantiate this as follows:\n\nved\u0101ham eta\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e41 mah\u0101ntam \u0101ditya-var\u1e47a\u1e41 tamasa\u1e25 parast\u0101ttam eva vidv\u0101n am\u1e5bta iha bhavati n\u0101nya\u1e25 panth\u0101 vidyate ayan\u0101yayasm\u0101t para\u1e41 n\u0101param asti ki\u00f1cid yasm\u0101nn\u0101\u1e47\u012byo na jy\u0101yo 'sti ki\u00f1cit\n\n\"I know that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all material conceptions of darkness. Only he who knows Him can transcend the bonds of birth and death. There is no way for liberation other than this knowledge of that Supreme Person.\n\n\"There is no truth superior to that Supreme Person because He is the supermost. He is smaller than the smallest, and He is greater than the greatest.

It is a part of the condition that restores the never lost, and re-establishes what is forever and forever true. It is the invitation to God\u2019s Word to take illusion\u2019s place; the willingness to let forgiveness rest upon all things without exception and without reserve. \n\nIt is the all-inclusive nature of Christ\u2019s Second Coming that permits it to embrace the world and hold you safe within its gentle advent, which encompasses all living things with you. There is no end to the release the Second Coming brings, as God\u2019s creation must be limitless. Forgiveness lights the Second Coming\u2019s way, because it shines on everything as one. And thus is oneness recognized at last. \n\nThe Second Coming ends the lessons that the Holy Spirit teaches, making way for the Last Judgment, in which learning ends in one last summary that will extend beyond itself, and reaches up to God. The Second Coming is the time in which all minds are given to the hands of Christ, to be returned to spirit in the name of true creation and the Will of God. \n\nThe Second Coming is the one event in time which time itself can not affect. For every one who ever came to die, or yet will come or who is present now, is equally released from what he made. In this equality is Christ restored as one Identity, in which the Sons of God acknowledge that they all are one. And God the Father smiles upon His Son, His one creation and His only joy.\n\nPray that the Second Coming will be soon, but do not rest with that. It needs your eyes and ears and hands and feet. It needs your voice. And most of all it needs your willingness. Let us rejoice that we can do God\u2019s Will, and join together in its holy light. Behold, the Son of God is one in us, and we can reach our Father\u2019s Love through Him.\n\nSource: Course In Miracles channeled book.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 69990, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "2nd Coming Of Christ (Course In Miracles Quote)", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e0sb41/2nd_coming_of_christ_course_in_miracles_quote/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "yxzyxx", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_420m6azn", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574553423, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e0qgfj/my_christian_family_sometimes_puts_a_damper_on_my/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e0qgfj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 45, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e0qgfj/my_christian_family_sometimes_puts_a_damper_on_my/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574553491, "score": 1, "selftext": "Recently I saw a floating orb of light and felt a lot of peace in the room after it left.

Therefore I've come to accept all these teacings as ways of describing our reality - like fantasy with good teachings for humans to excel in life. I know nothing and I've come to accept that. I'm a very skeptical individual and these teachings have stimulated me during the years. \n\nI've had the fortune to be able to travel and experience a lot of this world. These travels and experiences made me come in contacts with people who are able to acquire the information of higher vibrating atoms/matter. People who have the ability to pick up \"higher-vibrating-energy\" explain and show me with practical guidance HOW this reality is made up and how it works. \n\nHow to travel far beyond what we think is humanly possible. How to extend our \"light-body\", connect it to the other \"layers\". To connect to other \"atmospheres\". I didn't believe this. I've been hearing about it. NEVER EVER believed it. Thought it was a hoax. \n\nNO matter HOW much I've read on this topic, it was all shenanigans for me. Until those days.  \nI still don't somehow believe it is possible. To go back to other incarnations that I've had and to learn how to fix my karmatic bands which are holding me and the people around me connected - All relationships are not good for a reason. We have work to do.   \nI've been deep into psychedelics, ayahuaschas ceremonies and San Pedros ceremonies where I fucking lost it - multiple times. Getting all my previous \"society-built-up-mentalbarries-and-how-everything-works\" shot to fucking oblivion by these plants - A new way of perspective indeed. \n\nBut. This. These experience with these people... I still don't understand.. but, somehow I experienced what its like to travel. I now know how to travel. To something bigger in broad fucking daylight. In a classroom, midday - BAM - straight out into the universe. \n\nThese teachings are very old and something we all knew before. By security reasons the teaching will be spent on people who can bring the teaching forward - generation from generation. When I heard this I thought to myself:   \n\"Fucking bullshit, secret teachings?? What is this fuckign indiana jones??\"   \nThis is what all those \"secret societies\" say...\n\nBut I cant explain this. This is bigger. \n\nI now stand with a dilemma. I'm entering a new zodiac for me. Where my powerful \"soul\" is breaking through my personalities. Rapidly changing. Rapidly learning. \n\nBy doing this (seems to be happening faster and faster) I now understand that I cannot turn back. My choices have been made and this time I'm really scared. Being that seeker that I'm,I know.. I know that I cannot stop. I know my nature. Exploring every goddamn rabbit-hole... This time I have to go deep. Deep out of the abyss we call earth.  Opening up to the teachings of the old. \n\nI'm now entering grounds that I haven't even been able to fathom before....  \nThis group and our brothers and sisters who walked this path before are guiding us all on our path to higher understandings.\n\nMy question, my need for advice is - Should I continue with this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Been introduced to a society.

Hope you're all well!\n\nWondering if anyone has thoughts on some mysterious animal encounters I've been having. It feels like omens but I don't know what it means! (the last one is the most important)I live in the city, I've lived at the same place for three years, never see animals except for stray cats and a rare dog.  \n3 weeks ago I was walking from my apartment to the store, when a stray cat I've never seen appeared in front of me. I sat for a bit to try to get it to come over, I kept trying but it wouldn't come, but every time I started to walk away it would follow. Eventually I said \"well okay buddy I gotta get there before it's too late, seeya\" and it followed me like a cartoon (I stopped and looked back and it would hide under a car or freeze, I'd take a few steps and it would follow) this continued till the front of the complex and when I turned around I saw the cat staring at me from the gate. Never seen that stray again.  \nLast week walking home in the dark I suddenly come face to face with a deer. It doesn't run away, it stares at me, walks towards me, nibbles the grass. I wait patiently and just let it vibe, it's literally two feet away from me. Eventually someone leaves their apartment and the deer kind of lightly jogs away, not a scared run, just like \"ok guess I'll go\" and it stopped to look at me, a few deer buddies appeared and they all just stood and stared at me, before casually turning away and leaving. I've never seen a pack of deer just chilling so calmly right in ATL.   \nTHEN. THURSDAY NIGHT. I get this massive urge to go to the store, i don't have much to buy, it's 8pm, dark, but i just feel like I NEED to be outside. I feel a weird vibe the whole time I'm walking.  Then as I return home around 9pm, I hear a giant rustle and see something leap out of the corner of my eye. I was worried it was a hobo since they start to hang around my complex when it's cold and some of them have proven dangerous. Then I see a figure move. Then it climbs up a tree, it's a cat? giant rat-thing? I walk closer... closer...it's a giant Opossum. (The first time in my entire 22 years of life I've seen an Opossum! The only Possum reference I have is that Over The Hedge pixar movie!!) I'm dumb so I just walked straight over next to it, it casually just climbs up the tree so that he's just a bit above eye level. The white parts of face almost glowing and his eyes.. indescribable. I was frozen there just looking into it's eyes, other people passed me, two cars passed by me slowly like\"Wtf is this girl just looking into the forest for\" but I was just.. transfixed. He stared down at me so regally, so intensely, he was huge btw I always thought they were small, but I couldn't move,I felt like he was trying to communicate something to me. I stood for so long you guys, he stayed there looking into me. It got to the point where I started getting emotional, and every time I think about how I felt in that moment I get emotional (like right now) I felt like I was going to burst into tears and I'd been standing there forever in the dark so I just kind of slowly walked away and said \"okay... I'll see you later...\"  \n I just... an Opossum stared into my soul and was trying to communicate something to me, but I don't know what!! It's driving me nuts!! I've met cool animals before but it was so.... freaky this time. The air the energy the WAY he looked at me, I feel like I was given something, shown something, but I'm incapable of understanding WHAT.   \nI've also had a few weird dreams about a MASSIVE creepy screech owl coming down and attacking me, preventing me from entering my apartment. idk if that's related.   \nWish I could have taken a picture to make you understand, I mean he didn't even look like a real life creature, it was like some sort of spirit or otherworldly being taking the shape of a possum.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 69903, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Strange Animals keep coming to me, what does it mean?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e0m2yd/strange_animals_keep_coming_to_me_what_does_it/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "world_citizen7", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2o0msjd0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574531946, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e0lf17/loving_yourself_is_not_overrated_however_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e0lf17", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 31, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e0lf17/loving_yourself_is_not_overrated_however_the/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574531947, "score": 1, "selftext": "I mean I come across so many variations of the question, 'How do I love myself?' on some of these boards.

If I don't dream it means I don't have a purpose and a reason to dream, it means I am hopeless and lost. I've felt like this before, I guess this is what depression feels like, and when this happened to me it was usually because a \"technical difficulty\" prevented me from making reasonable plans. I know letting go would be easier in theory, but that is not doable for me, I was never the type of person to go with the flow without caring. I hate the emptiness of not having a goal so I can't do it.\n\nHowever, dreaming by definition is making a plan about something that doesn't exist in the present, it involves some degree of uncertainty and wishful thinking. I don't dream about things that I know for certain will happen because where's the fun in that? Most of the time I dream about something that requires some growing and expanding because those dreams are the most satisfying. However this also requires the persistence to keep the dream and desire alive while I grow in preparation for that manifestation. The problem is that in the beginning I don't manifest it because I don't feel ready, and after a while I start to hate the expectation and disappointment and so a negative energy surrounds that goal (resistance I guess) and I don't manifest it anymore until I let go of the resistance by moving on. This sounds good except most of the time it involves goals that are simply not feasible anymore once I've moved on. Examples: people stalking me after I've dumped them for not treating me right, work opportunities that are too costly to change at a moments notice, apartments that manifest after I already moved someplace else, etc.\n\nI know the typical things that are advised in these types of situations: deal with the disappointment, the expectation, being more flexible, feeling that I don't deserve it and why I don't feel ready, etc. I tried all these things, however, I feel in my particular case the huge problem that I have is the negative energy that surrounds that particular goal once the desire reaches a certain threshold. It is an energy so thick that I can touch it with my hands, I can see it and feel it, and once this happens it poisons everything about this goal. And the even bigger problem is that when I was younger this didn't happen so much because I felt I had time to grow, but nowadays I have less time and patience and it starts to poison big areas of my life such as career, relationships etc, it's not about specific goals anymore but it transcends that topic and poisons everything in that area. It is starting to feel scary, I feel myself being close to that dark pit of despair and depression and it's terrifying.\n\nSo my specific question is: how can I stop this negative energy attaching itself to a goal (other than having less expectations), and once that happened, how can I remove that negative energy around a goal other than moving on?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 69885, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Asking some advice about a pattern I've noticed in my manifestations regarding expectations and disappointment", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e0l1d6/asking_some_advice_about_a_pattern_ive_noticed_in/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "BB-3", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_52tknox1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574530305, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e0l0wv/meditation_survey_grad_thesis_study/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e0l0wv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e0l0wv/meditation_survey_grad_thesis_study/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "Sorct-p_6GU7fDLF7spXPDJwkErqSyPzkSXHXQhJR0c", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99e342e53c1da6ad64e5191890a68011aa208652", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b01d1c9285c306afb96be09b8add7ce737ab64a", "width": 216}, {"height": 167, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93fc923dc20d601ecfe9365d8b4c99b488ee2a11", "width": 320}, {"height": 334, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1eb5233ee7c70f54b32940bae05103111db84520", "width": 640}, {"height": 502, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2af7a9b1b78500e8b5e63df4727c565eaa3cf4c8", "width": 960}, {"height": 565, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fd9999061823901076cf5a93d8eda1adc6fc2bf", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 628, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f6f55b828d7b119a03162c74b4f7e141744b9abf", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1574530308, "score": 1, "selftext": "Meditators!

I feel like this could help whoever stumbles upon it and could relate to it. I copied and pasted it, so some things I describe might be hard to follow, so just let me know if you have any questions:\n\nThis might end up being a long post, but I do think I can help with insight. Also I sometimes speak poetically, so please ask if you don't understand a concept I'm explaining.\n\nI don't know if it's a spiritual awakening. I honestly don't know much in that field to say in confidence and use the term. However it might be and we're just using different words to describe the same thing. So if so just follow with that understanding.\nBut anyways, what I am confident in is energy/chakras. And also non ejaculatory orgasm. Including the kind that you're experienced with currently(I've read your previous threads on other subreddits)\n\nAnyways what you're describing is what I would call simply an overflow of energy from one chakra center, that's causing an almost flare up (or what we can metaphorically call an allergic reaction) in another chakra center.\n\nI'm using chakras to give us a baseline of understanding but you can use whatever name works for you\nWe're all energetic beings. Energy comes in and out of us through chakras. So for example let's say all of your chakra points closed up inside of you. And I mean shut tight. You would die. You are animated through energy. Life Energy is only able to come in via chakras. They are the gatekeepers. Me personally I believe it's actually really hard to COMPLETELY shut even one of your chakras (even with experiencing traumatic experience. I'll explain further) but you can pinch it pretty tight. \n\nAnyways what I think is most likely your situation is that you, before your orgasm cultivation practice, had maybe one or two chakra points that was particularly pinched pretty tight. The rest were more or less normal(probably more less than more). Anyways after beginning this practice and getting good at it, a couple of your chakra points opened up A LOT. imagine this. Let's  say you have a hose with running water. Now let's say this hose gets pinched really hard (but not to the point of letting water out) in 2 points in the hose. Now let's say that in 5 other points, the hose is being pinched but not nearly as hard. What do you think the results would be?\n\nYou'd get water coming out of the hose, but it wouldn't be nearly as much as it was naturally designed for. That was you before NEO cultivation. \n\nUsing that same example, let's say you let go of all the pinches on the hose except for one point that was pinched the tightest? What would happen. All that water pressure that was divied up throughout the hose will be localized and focused on that one pinch point. The water would be almost too much to contain and you can feel it wanting to the escape. Have you ever placed your finger on the top of a running hose hole, causing pressured water to squirt out? It'd be like that. That's you right now.\n\n I don't know you or your situation fully, so I can't explain which chakra point is being affected by what specifically, but what i believe is happening is that you have opened up a lot of your chakra points through this practice and that has allowed a lot of energy to come flowing in. However there is probably one or 2 chakras that is still really pinched off, so you're bumping hard against it causing what I believe a lot of people refer to a \"Kundalini awakening\"\n\nLet me also make a note that you can never have \"too much energy\". I had a teacher explain this really well. You can't open your chakras/energy centers \"too much\" or \"over stimulate\" them. We as humans are naturally supposed to have an abundant amount of energy flowing our way. However, when you work towards opening yourself to more energy you will bump into chakra points that might need a little more work opening up. \n\nBefore I give my solution, let me finally explain what causes our chakra points to get more and more pinched off: trauma and conditioning. When we go through life, we pass through a lot of things that we have to do to fit it. Things that may not be who we really are, but is socially acceptable(whether from your family, friend group, society, etc). This happens mostly in childhood, and we don't know any better. All we know at that age is that being reprimanded feels bad and being rewarded feels good. So we quickly learn match the status quo. For simplicity sake, lets say these conditioning causes the small pinches in your chakra points. Now what would cause the big pinches in your chakra points? Trauma. A traumatic event. A death in the family, child hood sexual abuse, a psychological bad trip from psychedelics (bad trip), you name it. These intense experience causes severe trauma that has the ability to pinch your chakra points pretty good.\n\nSolution: I wouldn't write all this up just to not give some advice, for either you or whoever happens to wander to this post. We're all in this together.\n\nAnyways my advice is to simply observe. Meditation helps. Just watch where your thoughts and emotions go to when you feel that pressure. What is the energy trying to tell you? I know for me personally, I had a really traumatic experience on lsd. Before my healing process I was avoiding going to sleep because it felt like I was losing myself. Similar to you, I would see strange shapes and colors, and just like you, it felt like I was high throughout the day. Me personally, it felt bad and overwhelming. Life felt surreal. Whenever I would listen to music, it felt like the music were sending me messages of thoughts that was already in my head. It was so trippy experiencing that when I knew I was physiologically sober. Imagine listening to Justin beiber \"what do you mean\" and being sure that it was coded messages that was made just for you explaining the constructs of the universe. Ai yai yai.\n\nAt the time I just tried distracting myself. It  felt like I was going crazy and if I indulged in it I would lose my mind. I distracted myself by just watching mindless TV shows and podcasts until I knocked myself out. Not fall asleep. Knocked out. Anyways one day I told myself i can't keep living like this. My quality of life was deeply affected. So one day, instead of distracting myself I just sat with myself before sleep. What came was a lot of intense emotions and feelings. Ones that I can't even describe now.\n\n They felt alien (btw, another tip, when I say observe, it doesn't necessarily mean analyse yourself. It just means be present and aware of what's happening right now without intentionally ignoring it. Sometimes the trauma isn't something you can physically pin point or mentally explain. It can sometimes be a spiritual blockage beyond human understanding. That's what it felt like with this episode of lsd trauma. It felt like it had alien orgins. What it was exactly does t really matter for the sake of this post). When I decided to do just sit with it, it got more intense but I didn't flinch. At that point, I knew anything was better than the life I was living because of this trauma and I just couldn't keep distracting myself to fall asleep forever. It was affecting my lucid dreaming practice(more on this later.) So I just sat with it. And what happened next was magical.\n\nHave you ever wondered what it's like to be pinned to an unmovable chair and have a tornado run past you? Me neither, but guys I swear that's what it felt like. It felt really chaotic, and then at a certain point..... Quiet. Energetic. My whole body was buzzing. Relief is a good word. I was in the eye of the storm. Past all those confusing and dramatic feelings is peace. It was crazy. The saying \"the only way out is through/in\" is a good phrase to describe what happened. I had to feel it without judgment to heal it. Afterwards, that particular trauma didn't affect my sleep or my life to an overwhelming extent. Still a lot of healing though that came afterwards though. But I digress. This is life. Growth and healing. And fun. And hamburgers bruh. Hamburgers are amazing. Like I'm actually pretty hungry right now. Should probably get some. Food.\n\n\nWho are you really? You're what we were talking about this whole time. You're water. You're energy. The more you let the water flow, the more you can let who you really are shine through. The less you let the water flow, the more lost you tend to feel.\n\nAs a final note. There are other type of non ejaculatory orgasms. Mantak chia popularized the kinds of NEO without using a toy. Just simply using your mind and arousal. He has a book that I believe would help even your energies out. It has a lot of eastern philosophy though. While I do jive with a lot of it, I believe spirituality is simply the study of YOURSELF, so no one philosophy or religion can comtain the infinite being that you are. That being said, what he has to say is solid.\n\nSome book recommendations:\n\nLearning to love yourself by \"Gay Hendricks\"\n\nThe multi orgasmic male by \"Mantak Chia\"\n\nThe untethered soul by \" Michal A Singer\"\n\nI'm not going to be modest. Each one of these 3 books even separately are life changing. I'm sure you can find all of these book for free online if you're so inclined. I bought them out of appreciations for these guys.\n\nP.s, I think you are properly primed to have amazing lucid dreams. Especially since it's relatively easy for you to morph shapes into things as you're falling asleep. Check out my other posts on my profile.\nAny questions let me know.

Instead I went to college and ended up working as a social worker the  past 4 years or so, and while I appreciated that I was doing some good for others, I still didn't feel like I was meant to be doing it more than anything else. For me, that's music. Nothing else has ever come to me so naturally. Honestly, often when I write a song, it's like they just happen to me, like I'm hardly even responsible for them other than as the vessel with the privilege of delivering the sounds of the spirit flowing through me. I don't know any music theory or bother planning out the structure of them in advance. I just wait for inspiration to strike and when it does, an entire song will just come to me and the basic instrumental and melodic framework will be done in a single writing session. I'm only saying this because nothing else is really like that for me, like I'm in a complete state of flow and synchronicity. And when I hear my own music, it's like I'm experiencing something that was made just for me and given to me to experience the catharsis within the sounds of my own emotional spectrum, and I feel so compelled to just share that with other people with humility and gratitude.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo eventually I realized that a life in music wasn't really a choice but a necessary eventuality- the thing I was born to do. And ever since then, I see 333 almost every day in some way or other, sometimes in the most *insane* ways. Just today was wild. I was on the phone with my sister who also has opened herself up to the influence of the spirit all around us, and I was telling her about how I've been seeing 333. She believed me, but almost as a little gift and confirmation, our mom called her while we were talking which led her to go to her text thread and tell her that she'd call her back, and when she did that, she realized that about a half hour earlier, the last text she sent to our mom mentioned me in a small way and was sent at 3:33pm. It was the icing on the cake to make her see how real it was, and we got to share a moment of just pure euphoria, like we were both in tears and laughing because it just felt so indescribably amazing to know we're not alone in this life. In the same day, my partner (who also sees 333 a lot as well as 239, the time she was born) texted me a screenshot of a client's address she came across at work (with the name blurred of course), and it was 333 Porterfield (my last name is Porter). And without realizing it, she sent me that text at 3:33 pm. I'd been seeing it a ton this week, and today was another level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite knowing that I've started on the right path toward realizing my life's true purpose, I experience daily battles with anxiety related to terrified thoughts of not being able to make it to where I want to be with making music for a living and having an audience big enough to allow me to share this catharsis and emotional release with those who could benefit from it. I have tons of doubt and tons of worry that I got started too late and that my window has closed. I feel that 333 is there to remind me that I *am* on the right path and I am being helped and guided. It's a reminder that I'm loved and supported and that I have what it takes to make these dreams a reality because if that weren't true, I wouldn't have been these gifts and this ability to know and feel that it's what I was born to do. I see 333 as the spirit world and my guardians telling me to keep going and reassuring me that I'm on my way in the right direction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, for anyone who also sees 333 a lot and feels in their heart that it's a message of good things but none of them have seemed to happen for you yet, ask yourself this. Do you feel like you're taking the actions necessary? Believe me I'm in  the same boat but just trying to remember that seeing this stuff means  I'm supported and on the right path, but I still have to move my feet  and my hands and my mouth to make the things I want to happen start  showing up in my life. We still have to do our parts with what we're  given. It's just reassurance that we have what it takes to make our  lives what we want them to be if we act in synchronicity with the things  that feel right to us, like literally the stuff that physically feels  GOOD when you daydream about it being in your life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've just felt this so powerfully today and wanted to share this message as encouragement to any one else who might have a similar experience. Search inside yourself and find what it is that makes you feel at one with the truth and at peace with your feelings tied to what you want most for your life. Once you find it, take the actions that feel most natural and guided toward your heart's desires and start chipping away at the marble to slowly reveal the work of art that is your destined life. I really feel this. And when you are able to start experiencing the life you've been asking for and striving for, do so with great humility and always with a sense of gratitude for everyone who helped you get there, both humanly and spiritually. Acceptance of this truth in your life and gratitude for even the tiniest glimpse of the miracle that we're given will multiply the rewards that you receive from it. This has been my experience thus far, and I feel an honest desire for others to know the warmth and the love I feel when I know I'm protected and supported and encouraged by something much greater than all of us, that also flows throughout all of us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd really like for anyone else with any similar experience to share it if you feel like it, or anyone with questions or uncertainties to share them as well so we can all try to support each other the way the universe does for us.

I've been on a bit of a spiritual journey since my psychotic episodes 7 years ago. I was put on meds for them both and come out of them med free. Then about 2 years ago I got diagnosed with Bipolar type 2. Still to this day I can't really make sense of my psychosis' but I know on a spiritual stance they really did something to me. \n\nThey let me let go of all the heart ache from such a young age. All the anger all the blame. \n\nAfter they'd happened i was depressed for a good year, in envy of my old self, not being able to forgive myself for what had happened and how much a screwed my life up during them. Frustrated trying to forgive everyone and change their views on me without getting my life back to how it was before I had them. \n\nI had to stop taking all drugs. (I was a heavy pot smoker before and dabbled in a few harder drugs which set of psychosis) after a while I began to forgive myself and realise to just let everyone be and accept I can't change the way people think and feel. That I can't take back what I did.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed with Bipolar I had two young kids.. not long after I broke up from their dad as just realised we didn't make a great couple.\n\nAbout 6 months after I broke up with their dad I met Mike. Mike was into all kinds of drugs but he really loved psychedelics.. He was teaching me about third eye activation.. and the physical penal gland. But this was from a drug stance. He was really trying hard to convince me to take DMT.. I almost did but after a bit of research I thought this was basically the worst thing for me because I could basically end up in a mental ward and lose both my kids just because of this trip. Too much to risk. \n\nMike and I broke up.. I find myself down the rabbit hole of YouTube and come across a guided meditation channel.. I gave it a quick try and I was amazed! I was hooked. I also found it really interesting that you could basically bring yourself to do all these things minus the drugs!\n\nI researched alot about awareness and higher self. \n\nNot long ago I met with one of my friends who does card readings and she taught me how to cleanse my house with sage. She also taught me about crystal healing. I've now gone all out and spent way too much with AfterPay (literally put a freeze on my account haha) on crystals and books but I'm so excited about discovering this!\n\nSo I was listening to TOOLs song Opiate the other day and the lyrics \"Jesus Christ won't you come save my life now, open my eye blind me with your light now\" this really hit something in me and made so much sense. \n\nSo many religions take advantage of the third eye awakening experience that they plaster it with their beliefs and brand it as their own. I don't know what I believe in but I sure as hell don't believe anyone who tells you to do things their way just so they can be followed and make a profit.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 69781, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "On a spiritual journey", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e0c1hn/on_a_spiritual_journey/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Graceter", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_28yehdo7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574477921, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e0c0fm/as_soon_as_you_create_something_other_than_god_or/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e0c0fm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 16, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e0c0fm/as_soon_as_you_create_something_other_than_god_or/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574477922, "score": 1, "selftext": "There is only one God.

Its not something i consciously think about really but it feels and exhibits itself as reality. I dont even believe in luck really but if i did id have a lot of bad. I got hurt when i was 27 almost died have seven metal plates in my face now. I had a run in with testicular cancer managed to survive that also. Ive been divorced, failed going into the army TWICE due to mental health issues. Never been able to keep friends and ive been sitting in a room for 20+ years staring at a screen isolated.  Im not looking for pity etc as im actually thankful for these experiences i learn from them and grow stronger.  But ive just always felt like theres something fundamentally wrong with me on a basic level i cant shake. \n\nI took a DNA test a while back from ancestry and was learning about my family. Anyway long story short i came across this story  [http://broun.us/broun.us/The\\_Colstoun\\_Pear\\_and\\_the\\_Brouns\\_of\\_America.html](http://broun.us/broun.us/The_Colstoun_Pear_and_the_Brouns_of_America.html)  the name is spelled slightly different than mine but im like 90% sure this is my family. It may just be an interesting story or there may be a basis in fact. At this point i dont know. I just feel like theres something wrong. Holding me back besides just negative thinking etc. It feels heavy like a constant burden and i dont know how to get rid of it.  I want to shed this and be more open and kind and loving and just be more of who i truly am. \n\nIve had nothing but like 95% bad experiences on reddit (i dont blame anybody, just how it is i guess) so this is a shot in the dark. But if anybody would be willing to discuss this with me and maybe offer suggestions id appreciate it. You know besides seek counselling lol. Ive done that and am working on it. What im truly talking about hear though is not a mental health issue and is beyond that. Its something i know and feel all around me.  \n\nJust sometimes i feel like this causes me an overarching sense of loneliness and at times despair. I have a relationship with God and I try to be a kind good person but it never feels like enough. Feels like im paying a penance for something i know nothing about or even had anything to do with. \n\nIm listening to this currently and its helping somewhat and ive been praying about it.

Wtih this and in general. Too much isolation i guess. \n\nIm not truly expecting a real answer but if you stop by and say hello that works too. Hope yall have a good day and thanks for reading.

However at every opportunity he became more creepy, highlighting my initial intuition. \n\nI was eating breakfast one morning messaging a friend and he comes up to me and strokes my arm saying \u201cit will be okay\u201d ? I  said \u201cI\u2019m just looking at my phone?\u201d Coldly hoping he would get the message. Nope. I went on a trek thinking I wouldn\u2019t see him again and I get back and am doing art in a hostels garden and I see something in the corner of my eye and I look up (and get a fright) to see this guy 2 meters in front of me just staring. I then went out to a restaurant down the road so I didn\u2019t have to see him and I\u2019m eating dinner and he walks past and stops at the door with food saying \u201cyou want this\u201d and I said no Ofcourse.\n\n\nFast forward 7 days and I\u2019ve taken a bus  20+ hours out of Cusco to another town. I\u2019m eating breakfast in my hostel this morning and he walks up to me (??????) and kisses me on the cheek as if we\u2019re friends despite not even knowing my name. I was cold again because he gives me major creeps. The bar tender and another man came and sat next to me because they Witnessed it and how uncomfortable it made me and the way this guy was just watching me. That morning I had also asked to check in early and they said yes but the original room I booked was full so they moved Me.  I ended up moving to his room. Before knowing this I was trying to nap and I hear a \u201chello\u201d and he\u2019s sitting on the bed across from me just staring. He leaves the room and I hang up a blanket around my bunk to prevent him watching me while I sleep. He comes back and starts playing guitar at the base of my bed... occasionally peeking around to me. \n\nNow I won\u2019t take any shit, I\u2019ve been trying to be nice and I\u2019ve been extremely cold to him to get him to stop. If he does anything else I\u2019m going to tell him to fuck off. \n\nThere\u2019s something about his energy.

We treated each other very well for the most part, but both of us had baggage that we needed to let go of.\n\nLong story short, being with him helped me to not only address my worst fears, but I recently had a \"spiritual awakening\" and woke up to the truth, that truth being that love and the universe is infinite and abundant. We don't need to fear losing love because there's an infinite amount of love out there in the universe. I haven't told him or anyone the details of my journey, although part of me wonders if he's worse because of me.\n\nBut here's the issue: He still isn't awake, and I think he's doing a looooot worse than me emotionally. He's been the worst he's ever been recently, struggling, and I can tell by my intuition/talking to him that he's lost hope on not only love to others, but love to himself. He's even recently become withdrawn to me and my messages, which he's never done, which shows me he's really not doing well. I'm not concerned about him being with me or loving me (that's the last of my worries), but him helping me to spiritually wake up does hold a special place in my heart. I want to help teach him that love is infinite and that he's so worthy of love, but I don't know how. He's been withdrawn recently and barely talking to me, but I do see him next week to hang out and he told me he needed to open up about his stresses (which I wanna support him through).\n\nI guess that leads to my question: Is there a way that I can help him (and others) wake up or to feel love??? I'm very well aware of the possibility of failure and that he continues spiraling downward, but I wanna show him love as long as he's willing to maintain contact.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, thank you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 69713, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is there a way to support the guy who helped in my spiritual awakening????", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e06q2g/is_there_a_way_to_support_the_guy_who_helped_in/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Rose_Cobain27", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1ls376xb", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574453441, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e06jnb/spiritual_darkness/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e06jnb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Religious"}], "link_flair_template_id": "d45d5110-8418-11e7-ae2f-0e364122ef84", "link_flair_text": "Religious", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 22, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e06jnb/spiritual_darkness/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574453443, "score": 1, "selftext": "You are feeling dark now I know.

These two people were in my life for 10+ and 3+ years consecutively. And it the end , those friendships became very one sided and felt forced. Those friendships were my main ones in my adult life.

I even had a former friend tell me that I don't reach out to her enough when she also didnt do the same, we were both at fault but I got all of the blame and I decided not to reach out to her any longer.\n\nFortunately, I have one friend that remains in my life and we have gone through very different journeys with some similiar aspects but at the root of it, she loves and care about and knows me.

The Gospel of Jesus Christ is known worldwide at this point. But the truth of it and how it is implemented has been sorely misinterpreted by the vast majority of Christian denominations. I ask that before you read this that you pray for revelation in scripture, the oneness of God, and that the true plan of salvation is revealed to you. Pray in faith and a willingness to receive revelations of the truth today. Praise the Lord.\n   \n  I'll start off by breaking down \"One Lord\u201d. \"Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord:\"-Deuteronomy 6:4. \"Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.\"-Isaiah 44:6. \"I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.\"-Isaiah 43:11. \"Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.\"-James 2:19. \"For unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given: and the government shall be upon His shoulder: and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.\"-Isaiah 9:6. \"Thus saith the Lord, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from thy womb, I am the Lord that maketh all things, that stretch forth the heavens alone, that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself\"-Isaiah 44:8. Still with me? This one might knock your socks off. (\"In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God\"-John 1:1. \u201cAnd\u00a0the word was made flesh and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth\"-John 1:14. \u201cAnd I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.\u201d-John 1:33. Now let\u2019s have a quick look at who it was that the Spirit was descending upon- \u201cAnd Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon Him:\u201d-Matthew 3:16. \u201cAnd I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever;\u201d-John 14:16. Have a look at what Jesus says two scriptures later-\u201cI will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.\u201d-John 14:18. \u201cThen saith he (Jesus) to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD AND my God.\"-John 20:27-28. \"For there are three that bare record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.\"-John 5:7. \"Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father, and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?\"-John 14:9. \"I and my Father are one\"-John 10:30. \u201cI indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. But he that cometh (after) me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:\u201d-Matthew 3:11. Now let\u2019s have a look at the scripture that comes two verses AFTER that one, speaking of whom it was that came AFTER he spoke those words- \u201cThen cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.\u201d-Matthew 3:13. So, as we can plainly see from these scriptures alone, Jesus is God and the Holy Ghost. Manifest in the flesh. Became flesh and dwelt among us. \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.\u201d-John 14:6-7. \"For in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily\"-Colossians 2:9. :)\n\n     Now we can move on to the topic of \"one faith\". So, I will start off by saying that what I am doing here today is sharing the knowledge and revelation of scripture that I\u2019ve been given to fellow brothers and sisters in Christ and unbelievers alike. It is my duty as a good steward of the scriptural knowledge I have been bestowed with. What I am about to show you will be scripture. And if we can all agree that the Holy scriptures are truth and all God-breathed, we can agree that it is the truth whether I believe it or not, and it is the truth whether you believe it or not. I\u2019ll just jump right out there and say it. \"And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.\"-Acts 2:42. What is the Apostles' Doctrine you ask? We know that during the 3 year ministry of Jesus the apostles were the only ones that Jesus EVER gave the authority to create doctrine. Jesus also said- \"But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\"-Matthew 15:9. That is because anyone that deviates from the teachings of the apostles has made a serious mistake. And hence has led themselves and possibly others, away from the truth in the process. \"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.\"-Galatians 1:8-9 - Written by an apostle, the apostle Paul. More words from Jesus- \"Teaching them (us) to observe all things whatsoever I (Jesus) have commanded you (the apostles): and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen\"-Matthew 28:20. So, the Apostolic Doctrine or denomination is clearly the true church, the only church. It doesn't say that they continued stedfastly in the Methodist doctrine, or the Lutheran, or the Baptist, or the Catholic, or the Presbyterian, or Jehovah witnesses, or any other man-made denomination. Scripture clearly states which doctrine to continue stedfastly in. The Apostolic Pentecostal Church. I will again remind you that this is not my opinion, it\u2019s all backed up by scripture. Feel free to read up on the beliefs of the Apostolic Pentecostal Church because it is completely biblical. Man has made a mess out of the faith with the ridiculous amount of different denominations. Still with me? I know that one went pretty deep and cut right to the heart of things. And flat out discredited all other denominations outside of the Apostolic teachings. Let it be for His glory, and for truth.\n     \n     Now moving on to \"One baptism\". I think I\u2019ll start this out by showing scripturally to all that don't believe that we must be baptized in order to be saved, that we truly must be. Pay close attention to Jesus' words at HIS BAPTISM. Yes, even our Lord was baptized and here is why- \"But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptised of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill ALL righteousness. Then he suffered him.\"-Matthew 3:14-15. \u201cCan any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?\u201d-Acts 10:47. ALL must be baptised. For those of you that ask, \u201cwhat about the thief on the cross?\u201d he was not able to be baptised. Neither was Noah, Enoch, Elijah, Elisha, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, King David, Jeremiah, Isaiah, or any of the other man of faith from the old testament baptised either for that matter. So, do you think that they weren\u2019t saved because of that? They were saved, for those were the days before baptism. We can see in this verse that Jesus, after his resurrection, stood before the Apostles just before his ascension to the right hand of the majesty on high and told them \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name (singular) of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:\"-Matthew 28:19. Not Only was Jesus baptized, but he commanded that we are to be baptized also. Now back to that (singular) thing. Who is the father? Who is the Son? Who is the Holy Ghost? That's correct. Jesus Christ is the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. So, what am I saying? He commanded us to baptize in one name. Only one name can save. Only one name has power. There is power in the name of Jesus. He told us to baptise in the (name) of Jesus, not in his titles. In other words, he was not telling us to repeat his words as a baptismal formula, but that it should be done in his name. \"For whatsoever ye do in word or deed (baptism is a deed) do all in the name of the Lord Jesus.\"-Colossians 3:17. Now here is where we see Jesus giving the Apostle Peter the Keys to the Kingdom. \"And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and Upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\"-Matthew 16:18-19. And what was it that Peter commanded us to do to be saved? In the book of the Acts of the Apostles it is written \"Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?\"-Acts 2:37. And this was Peters direct response to their question of how to be saved. \"Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptised every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.\"-Acts 2:38. \"He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved; he that believeth not shall be damned.\"-Mark 16:16. \"And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptised, and WASH AWAY THY SINS, calling on the name of the Lord.\"-Acts 22:16. Seeing there plainly that without the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ we are still yet dead in our trespasses and sins. \u201cAnd such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.\u201d-1 Corinthians 6:11. \u201c(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)\u201d-Acts 8:16. When they heard this they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus.\u201d-Acts 19:5.\n     \"Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as many as the Lord our God shall call. And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.\"-Acts 2:38-42. One Lord, One faith, One baptism. To God be the Glory. I will also add this scripture. \"Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.\"-1 Corinthians 14:39. Hence, born of the spirit. I have a personal testimony of my infilling of the Holy Ghost and yes, the spirit does give the utterance. I pray that this reaches the eyes and hearts of anyone that has been led astray by false doctrine. There is so much more that God wants to do with you. Praise the Lord God Almighty. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, Amen.", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;11/18/2019\nOne Lord, One faith, One baptism\nEphesians 4:5\nAll scriptures from the King James Version&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; I&amp;#39;m going to spread some very important and fundamental biblical truths of scripture.

I\u2019ll just jump right out there and say it. &amp;quot;And they continued stedfastly in the apostles&amp;#39; doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.&amp;quot;-Acts 2:42. What is the Apostles&amp;#39; Doctrine you ask? We know that during the 3 year ministry of Jesus the apostles were the only ones that Jesus EVER gave the authority to create doctrine. Jesus also said- &amp;quot;But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.&amp;quot;-Matthew 15:9. That is because anyone that deviates from the teachings of the apostles has made a serious mistake. And hence has led themselves and possibly others, away from the truth in the process. &amp;quot;But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.&amp;quot;-Galatians 1:8-9 - Written by an apostle, the apostle Paul. More words from Jesus- &amp;quot;Teaching them (us) to observe all things whatsoever I (Jesus) have commanded you (the apostles): and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen&amp;quot;-Matthew 28:20. So, the Apostolic Doctrine or denomination is clearly the true church, the only church. It doesn&amp;#39;t say that they continued stedfastly in the Methodist doctrine, or the Lutheran, or the Baptist, or the Catholic, or the Presbyterian, or Jehovah witnesses, or any other man-made denomination. Scripture clearly states which doctrine to continue stedfastly in. The Apostolic Pentecostal Church. I will again remind you that this is not my opinion, it\u2019s all backed up by scripture. Feel free to read up on the beliefs of the Apostolic Pentecostal Church because it is completely biblical. Man has made a mess out of the faith with the ridiculous amount of different denominations. Still with me? I know that one went pretty deep and cut right to the heart of things. And flat out discredited all other denominations outside of the Apostolic teachings. Let it be for His glory, and for truth.\n\n Now moving on to &amp;quot;One baptism&amp;quot;. I think I\u2019ll start this out by showing scripturally to all that don&amp;#39;t believe that we must be baptized in order to be saved, that we truly must be. Pay close attention to Jesus&amp;#39; words at HIS BAPTISM. Yes, even our Lord was baptized and here is why- &amp;quot;But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptised of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill ALL righteousness. Then he suffered him.&amp;quot;-Matthew 3:14-15. \u201cCan any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?\u201d-Acts 10:47. ALL must be baptised. For those of you that ask, \u201cwhat about the thief on the cross?\u201d he was not able to be baptised. Neither was Noah, Enoch, Elijah, Elisha, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, King David, Jeremiah, Isaiah, or any of the other man of faith from the old testament baptised either for that matter. So, do you think that they weren\u2019t saved because of that? They were saved, for those were the days before baptism. We can see in this verse that Jesus, after his resurrection, stood before the Apostles just before his ascension to the right hand of the majesty on high and told them &amp;quot;Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name (singular) of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:&amp;quot;-Matthew 28:19. Not Only was Jesus baptized, but he commanded that we are to be baptized also. Now back to that (singular) thing. Who is the father? Who is the Son? Who is the Holy Ghost? That&amp;#39;s correct. Jesus Christ is the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. So, what am I saying? He commanded us to baptize in one name. Only one name can save. Only one name has power. There is power in the name of Jesus. He told us to baptise in the (name) of Jesus, not in his titles. In other words, he was not telling us to repeat his words as a baptismal formula, but that it should be done in his name. &amp;quot;For whatsoever ye do in word or deed (baptism is a deed) do all in the name of the Lord Jesus.&amp;quot;-Colossians 3:17. Now here is where we see Jesus giving the Apostle Peter the Keys to the Kingdom. &amp;quot;And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and Upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&amp;quot;-Matthew 16:18-19. And what was it that Peter commanded us to do to be saved? In the book of the Acts of the Apostles it is written &amp;quot;Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?&amp;quot;-Acts 2:37. And this was Peters direct response to their question of how to be saved. &amp;quot;Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptised every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.&amp;quot;-Acts 2:38. &amp;quot;He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved; he that believeth not shall be damned.&amp;quot;-Mark 16:16. &amp;quot;And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptised, and WASH AWAY THY SINS, calling on the name of the Lord.&amp;quot;-Acts 22:16. Seeing there plainly that without the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ we are still yet dead in our trespasses and sins. \u201cAnd such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.\u201d-1 Corinthians 6:11. \u201c(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)\u201d-Acts 8:16. When they heard this they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus.\u201d-Acts 19:5.\n &amp;quot;Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as many as the Lord our God shall call. And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. And they continued stedfastly in the apostles&amp;#39; doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.&amp;quot;-Acts 2:38-42. One Lord, One faith, One baptism. To God be the Glory. I will also add this scripture. &amp;quot;Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.&amp;quot;-1 Corinthians 14:39. Hence, born of the spirit. I have a personal testimony of my infilling of the Holy Ghost and yes, the spirit does give the utterance. I pray that this reaches the eyes and hearts of anyone that has been led astray by false doctrine. There is so much more that God wants to do with you. Praise the Lord God Almighty. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, Amen.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied":

everyone,\n\nthis is the first time I have ever tried to put into words how I see the world and English isn't my first language, but I hope some of this will make sense in a way.\n\nI currently have no one in my life who I can discuss this with and I really need some feedback around all of this..\n\n\\-What I have gathered is that normally when you perceive something like a face most people don't consciously perceive every detail all at once, but for some reason I think my filters are completely blown. When I look at someone's face I perceive all these details all at once and at the same time also the relationship between these details. It's like my mind focuses on every pore, but at the same time registers the distance between pores individual to eachother and in groups of pores relative to each other. Or the relationship between nose and ear, like the size, distance etc relative to the face as a whole.  And this way of perceiving things goes for literally everything I see. \n\n\\-Also in interaction with other people their words have a particulair color, texture, smell, color and sound to it which tells me information about all different kind of things. This doesn't have to be in person, it also can be through text message or when I am on the phone with someone or when I think about someone. \n\nEach person has an unique \"sensation\" or feeling signature for me. This can differ from textures, tastes, smells, sounds, colors etcetera.\n\nEspecially when people's thoughts, feelings and words don't match up I can feel it almost like a contraction type of movement/energy. I can see it when the colors of the thoughts, emotions,  and words are not in \"harmony\" or if the textures feel a certain way for example. \n\n\\-There is this \"place\" I call the library and if I want I can immediately \"go\" there, but it feels more like I am always there and it's more a question if I suppress that or not. \n\nThis library is infinite in all directions and the laws of this reality don't really apply there. It almost looks like a mandelbox kind of? And from here I have access to every timeline, every reality, every thought that has ever existed in any universe it seems and if I want I can experience any perspective I want to. \n\nIt is a like a \"place\" outside of time and space where I can observe the whole \"pattern of all of existence\" and experience any point/perspective in this pattern.\n\nIt is almost like a multidimensional tapestry when If I pose a question certain threads in this tapestry will \"light up\" and then I am instantly sucked into the pattern that these threads make up.  All of these threads are interconnected and sometimes when I follow a thread I end up in multiple places, beings, or perspectives all at once.  There is also no beginning or end to these threads/patterns.\n\nFor example when I talk to someone and they have a certain thought I can follow the thread of that thought relative to this life of that person and find the root, but I can go even further and follow it into either past lives in this universe or into parallel realities of this life. \n\nAnd if I go further I end up at the point where our universe \"began\" and the furthest I can go is back to the moment Source began to fracture and then the thought loops back until I am back in the present moment. \n\nBut there is literally no end or beginning.. it's almost like our universe is an atom of a bigger mechanism and that mechanism is an atom of an even bigger mechanism. And this goes on and on.  \n\nAs a kid I often used to get stuck in these loops where I would be sucked into these patterns I could not get out of it and it felt like I was imploding and exploding in uncountable ways, all at once. Sort of like a sensory/information overload on steroids I guess lol. \n\nBut now when I am following a thread/thought pattern I can stop when I want to and experience that moment in any perspective. So if I end up in a moment/scene in a past life I can \"freeze\" that scene and walk around in the scene or go into the perspective of anything that is included in the scene and experience it from that point of perspective. \n\n\\-Relative to my own life I think I never lost the connection with my own thread/pattern. I constantly as a kid had talks with \"people\" in other worlds/dimensions.  Everytime I was confused about what was happening to me in my life they sat me down and explained stuff to me. Like how the \"building\" blocks of my life were all placed by \"me\" and how everything is connected in this huge web, what my purpose was here, sometimes I spoke with people who later came into my life in future, and that for this life it was very important that I would not \"forget\".  So I retained the information of who I was before this life and all of that.\n\n\\-I think I may be very sensitive to life path potentials. I can \"feel\" or sense when a shift has occurred for either the whole collective of mankind or just for one person. \n\nIt's like the threads \"light up\" or something and they become more dense or crystallized and this comes with very vivid visions in my mind's eye.\n\n\\-I also write a lot and whenever I am writing I am in a place where everything already exists and depending on what I want to convey, or what what my intention is for my writing, or what kind of meaning or message I want to put into my writing, certain words will \"light up\" and they kind of shuffle around in my mind's eye until the \"right order\" is found and then I will have an \"aha moment\" and everything just flows as stream of consciousness without me thinking about it. \n\nThis feels like an inner sensation of a resounding yes, or a expansion type of movement throughtout my whole being.  If certain words don't taste, smell, or feel right or if the colors are not in \"harmony\" in relationship to other words I won't pick them.  And this works on multiple layers, because in one sentence certain words contain multiple layers, intentions, or meanings. \n\nEvery color, smell, taste etcetera has a different frequency/vibration and it depends on the observer which layer, or meaning will be activated. And when I am writing I am constantly checking if everything fits into the \"infinite pattern\" which is present in every thread I see, connecting everything in existence.\n\nThese Fractal patterns can be found in everything.  Not only in nature or the way the body works, like with your veins and stuff but also in people's thoughts, emotions, and even in how the flow of conversations go. How people interact with each other follows this certain pattern too. \n\nSo yeah I am really curious if anyone can relate to this or has any questions...and thank you for reading my rambles lol",

On the other hand a nondevotee may fully engage in his occupational duties and yet not gain anything.\" For material prospects, there are many activities both scriptural and customary. A transcendentalist is supposed to give up all material activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One may argue that by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one may attain the highest perfection if it is completed, but if one does not attain such a perfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually. It is enjoined in the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction of not executing prescribed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental activities properly becomes subjected to these reactions. The Bh\u0101gavatam assures the unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries. Even though he may be subjected to the reaction of not perfectly executing prescribed duties, he is still not a loser, because auspicious K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is never forgotten, and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is lowborn in the next life. On the other hand, one who simply follows strictly the prescribed duties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is lacking in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nThe purport may be understood as follows: humanity may be divided into two sections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated. Those who are engaged simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next life or spiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section. And those who follow the principles of prescribed duties in the scriptures are classified amongst the regulated section. The nonregulated section, both civilized and noncivilized, educated and noneducated, strong and weak, are full of animal propensities. Their activities are never auspicious because, enjoying the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually remain in material existence, which is always miserable. On the other hand, those who are regulated by scriptural injunctions and thus gradually rise to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness certainly progress in life.\n\nThose who are then following the path of auspiciousness can be divided into three sections, namely, 1) the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who are enjoying material prosperity, 2) those who are trying to find out the ultimate liberation from material existence, and 3) those who are devotees in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who are following the rules and regulations of the scriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes: those who are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification. Those who are after fruitive results for sense gratification may be elevated to a higher standard of life-even to the higher planets; but still, because they are not free from material existence, they are not following the truly auspicious path. The only auspicious activities are those which lead one to liberation. Any activity which is not aimed at ultimate self-realization or liberation from the material bodily concept of life is not at all auspicious. Activity in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the only auspicious activity, and anyone who voluntarily accepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under severe austerity. And because the eightfold yoga system is directed toward the ultimate realization of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, such practice is also auspicious, and no one who is trying his best in this matter need fear degradation.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the position of an unsuccessful transcendentalist engaged in auspicious activities ? What is the view of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam on the same ?**\n\n**Question 2 : What are the different sections of humanity engaged in regulated activities according to scriptures ? Which one of them is the best ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/dzxykn/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is640/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 69624, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is-6.40", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dzxyy8/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is640/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "MeMyselfandIeee", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4duscfyv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574408884, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dzxuha/i_am_concerned_about_quantum_jumping/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dzxuha", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Astral Projection"}], "link_flair_template_id": "61d6f73a-ceef-11e9-bfb2-0e1bc738eaf6", "link_flair_text": "Astral Projection", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dzxuha/i_am_concerned_about_quantum_jumping/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574408885, "score": 1, "selftext": "Just now, I was lying in my bed watching manifestation videos, until I stumbled upon a meditation video by a popular channel called youarethecreators.

It was about getting a bad haircut and my cousin making fun of me while I was looking down at some candy.

The person I am with seems to slowly but surely realizing his faults. I'm not sure what will happen in this relationship but Im changing and the universe knows it. My self love took the back burner for a little while in this relationship but now I have learned to let my cup pour over and share what has spilled over and not what is in my cup!\n\nI have recently had a friend of mine give me a tough love rant about my self doubt and self sabotage in terms of my worth and talent and it really shifted something in me. I am manifesting so much for myself and taking things slow and making deliberate moves.\n\nWith all of this, 5 years ago I had a very negative experience with an individual I did business with over a one week span. This person and I casually interacted on social media when they decided to reach out to do business with me. Tgis person wasted my time and made me feel uncomfortable and small. I completed the business obligation to this person and then sent them a lengthy message about how I felt about the encounter and that I no longer wish to communicate with them. \n\nFast forward to last week, this person sent me a few private messages out of the blue! Its been five years!

By needing to have a logical string of ideas to put down on paper, I overcome that and truly see what is going on in my own head.\n\nObviously, there is more to the self than what goes on in the mind. The heart is equally important, and I find myself writing from there when I broach topics I am passionate about. Typically I will let my fingers dance furiously on the keyboard while thoughts fly out faster than I can really comprehend what\u2019s going on at a cognitive level.

Such a person may appear to see all separate manifestations of the material nature, but in each and every instance he is conscious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, knowing that everything is the manifestation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's energy. Nothing can exist without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Lord of everything-this is the basic principle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the development of love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-a position transcendental even to material liberation. It is the stage beyond self-realization at which the devotee becomes one with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the sense that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes everything for the devotee, and the devotee becomes full in loving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. An intimate relationship between the Lord and the devotee then exists. In that stage, the living entity attains his immortality. Nor is the Personality of Godhead ever out of the sight of the devotee. To merge in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is spiritual annihilation. A devotee takes no such risk. It is stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101:\n\nprem\u0101\u00f1jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena                                                                                                                                           \nsanta\u1e25 sadaiva h\u1e5bdaye\u1e63u vilokayanti                                                                                                                                                      \nya\u1e41 \u015by\u0101masundaram acintya-gu\u1e47a-svar\u016bpa\u1e41                                                                                                                          \ngovindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi\n\n\"I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of \u015ay\u0101masundara situated within the heart of the devotee.\" (Bs. 5.38)\n\nAt this stage, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never disappears from the sight of the devotee, nor does the devotee ever lose sight of the Lord.

And I\u2019m not stargazing mind you- instead I\u2019m driving home from work at night (around 7-8pm). Which to me, is an unusual time to see that sort of phenomenon. \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s happened in the last week is I keep seeing owls flying in front/ over the top of my car. The first time this happened was the other night around 1am. The second time was tonight when I was driving home from work. Shortly after that I saw ANOTHER shooting star.

Also, just good feelings that don't need words and \"why not go through lives together\", despite my fear/anxiety of being \"an adult\", and having children)  \n\n\nNow where I'm at is pretty strange : these past months I've been trying to make everything right (doing sport, art regularly, eating well, etc), and help my girlfriend with this. We were both motivated and I had a really good streak of motvation and happiness for basically a whole week. No more panic attacks, everything feels good, motivation to create things I can sell, etc.  \nBut...as I was at peak happiness, I basically started drowning in depression again for no reason. And not a small one, the kind that numbs me so much I don't even want to do anything.   \nThis might pass tomorrow, or in one week, hardcore depression comes and goes, but...instead of ignoring it and waiting for it to pass, I'm wondering if I'm not missing anything and if I should not go deeper and try to dig out and find the wound(s) and do something with it instead of turning my head the other way until it passes (and comes back later)  \n\n\nThing is, I don't think I have any scars, even small ones. My parents were always great, I always found friends despite being a loner...People usually have so kind of trauma to fix, even small, but I don't know about mine. And if it's something that's in my very early childhood, I don't think I call recall anything from there.  \nSo basically...I don't know which way to go. I know there's no magic pill for this kind of stuff, but if there is some kind of practice (or any advice, really), grounded or more \"occult\" that would be eye opening for me (besides drugs, cause my anxiety would destroy me, I tolerate less and less things of the sort in my body as I'm very sensitive).  \n\n\nDon't know what to do and I have pretty dark thoughts (I don't think I'm on to commit suicide at all, but I feel so drawn underwater despite my efforts, it's very frustrating).  \nForgot to add, I have a heart condition that's not dangerous so far (and this may not help live in the present and think about our fragility and the fear of death).  \n\n\nSorry for the vent.

Below is my latest [blog/rant](https://tranceblackman.com/minority-rules/). First time posting here, but I've been reading through a number of the posts and getting a feel for the community. There are many great threads and topics, and a lot of caring souls out there. It's great to see. \n\nI hope this isn't overstepping or too self-promoting. I am looking for general feedback and insights as to whether or not this format serves anyone, save myself! I love writing about these things, and have published 500+ similar articles that I'm in the process of editing now. I feel the need to either grow the audience, expand the conversation, or even consider shutting it down. My aim is to publish some books in this vein, as compilations of my photography and these short articles. I am keen to author fiction as well.\n\nI'm still finding my voice, and hope to keep improving in depth and style. If you've read this far, thank you for your patience. :)\n\n\\- - -\n\n# Minority Rules\n\nIsn\u2019t it strange that our laws and statutes are enacted to allegedly protect the majority from the vastly less significant minority \u2014 those of a criminal or distorted character and propensity \u2014 who would engage in or profit from exploiting an otherwise open system of commerce, education and governance?\n\nI guess the question really is, if the system is so open and beneficent, why is any person or entity *ever* interested in taking more, stealing from others, or otherwise throwing wrenches in the machinations of the modern world? Why have they ALWAYS wanted to do this (ever since anyone had anything or anyone worth selling, trading, or stealing)? Is it just about power, control, and amassing more stuff? If that\u2019s the case, then it really doesn\u2019t compute, because nobody can take a damn earthly thing with them when they die \u2014 and pursuing illicit and dangerous means of stuff acquisition is dangerous to one\u2019s life. What\u2019s the point? How can they be so truly naive?\n\nToday, we live in a world where corporations profit from putting people and keeping people in prison. What the unholy fuck is that about? OF COURSE this will corrupt and distort any system of justice. OF COURSE there will be somewhat legal and wholly illegal incentives to get more bodies into those beds. It follows that there is likely a significant percentage of people wrongly or unnecessarily charged and sentenced, improperly defended, or racially and ethnically stereotyped. The other side of the coin is that with things always improving for inmates \u2014 regarding access to education, counselling, food, a decent bed and a roof \u2014 that aspects of our society would feel they\u2019d be better off in prison. It speaks very clearly to the state of things in the perverted culture of this era.\n\nBut these punitive system errors happen everywhere, especially in schools and corporate structures. Conformity is the safest way to keep minds in line, but it\u2019s the most destructive thing to the human spirit. Any level of creative and emotional suppression leads inevitably to dysfunction and will spill out into areas of life less resilient or capable of withstanding the pressures. It is evolving, albeit slowly. We have a much more conscious generation moving into and uprooting all aspects of stagnant paradigms and systemic failures. I believe we\u2019ll get there, but we have to be incredibly mindful, aware, and diligent to not slide back into the drudgery of the old stories.\n\nAs ever, we can and should employ this philosophy to ourselves as individuals. Our societies and cultures reflect as much of what is happening within us as it expresses in the world without. The spiritual essence of which we derive consciousness and our existential process has limitless capacity for all shades and colors of light. There is an inherent indestructibility that, once tapped, should embolden our presence, our audacity, and our greater sensemaking. Primarily, this concerns wounding and trauma. Seemingly insignificant events (or those that our guardians would have suggested were as much) can find a sticking place in our conscious \u2014 though primarily our subconscious \u2014 minds, and implant an energetic anchor that dramatically alters our entire lives.\n\nWhen it comes to emotional discernment, we may not be immediately aware of how we\u2019re blinding ourselves to a greater meaning and truth. If we have devised or enacted a law, or rule, within our psychology \u2014 most often at a very young age; mom or dad said (or yelled) something that we took to heart \u2014 that law doesn\u2019t get repealed or vetoed until we\u2019re aware of its existence and its persistent inefficacy. We may have inadvertently imprisoned aspects of our personality or identity without due cause or examination. So, much later in life, these things invariably come to the surface \u2014 or have led us down some dark alleys into self-destruction and violence.\n\nIt\u2019s simple, but it\u2019s not easy. There is an enormous amount of wounding and emotional and karmic trauma in our world today. As an example, observe the utter madness that climate change is eliciting across the planet. We\u2019ve found a collective scapegoat and it\u2019s getting all of our mounting passion and unresolved trauma. Our planet will far outlive anything we ever do to it, or ourselves, yet we\u2019re talking and acting like (once again) it\u2019s the end times. Ridiculous, but not at all surprising.\n\nIt is essential that we shift away from ecologically damaging practices. Obviously, the human industrial machine is in desperate need of taming, retraining, and restructuring \u2014 and the sooner the better. We can\u2019t appreciate how capable our Earth is in its own adaptivity and recovery, but in the short term \u2014 in our brief human capacity of a lifetime, or in a generational perspective \u2014 WE are the ones in danger, not the planet. Please stop or let go of the notion that the planet is in any way truly in danger. She\u2019s magnificent, and ancient, and patient, and loving beyond what our minds can conceive. I fear that in our efforts to rectify and repair the anthropogenic impact our sciences are saying we\u2019re responsible for we may do ourselves a lot more harm than good. It\u2019s a vast topic that is blatantly oversimplified in the mainstream and on social media. Please dig deeper.\n\nUltimately, the one pointing the finger has the greatest and most important work to do. Our perceptions color our reality and define our world. The more we can shift and elevate and evolve away from victimhood, scarcity, fear, and lack, the more we can step into an empowered, inspired, innovative, unifying progress and collective evolution that benefits the all.\n\nI think we\u2019re ready, and more than capable, but right now, it\u2019s difficult to say which way things will go.\n\n*Solvitur ambulando*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 69288, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Minority Rules", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dz7fql/minority_rules/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Shrugbeternowthaneva", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4vj8puem", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574276663, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dz6lh9/perfection_is_attained_maintenance/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dz6lh9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dz6lh9/perfection_is_attained_maintenance/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574276664, "score": 1, "selftext": "I am not a perfect woman. By all means my feelings of being a failure may be true. I have hurt many people. I\u2019ve lied. I\u2019ve cheated. I\u2019ve stolen, but most of all I have stolen time from myself by allowing myself to descend to depravity for years. I have no idea who I could have been in the present if I had stayed to the correct course and resisted the temptation of giving in to my banal desires in the depths of my self-pity.\n\nI have to look on the bright side of things though. I would not be me if I didn\u2019t walk down those dark, twisted paths in my early 20\u2019s. There is a very good possibility I would not be spiritual at all if I kept working on myself like the tides of life demanded. But, I believe it was inevitable that I broke down during the time I did. A stone thrown eventually falls. We live in a cause and effect universe, so in reality we have already made all the choices we are living. Now we\u2019re just trying to understand why.\n\nAnd I know why I walked down the paths I shouldn\u2019t have. Without the knowledge of the wrong paths, I wouldn\u2019t be able to properly empathize with those who are also lost and wandering. I would not be able to help those who need help the most. Because I have seen the things I have, I have the ability to tell a past me in the present the right things to help them on their path. I can help the seekers find the real thing they are seeking deep down in their soul. For that, I am grateful.\n\nI am not off the hook though. I still need to work on myself. Sometimes I may be too hard on myself, but it is for a good reason. By being so adamant about being productive and steering myself towards brighter futures, I am awakening my full potential. I have so much to give, and that makes me happy. There is so much I can do for the world with my talents, and I await the chances unfolding before me to do so. I cannot imagine what it will be like to find another me and be able to impart what wisdom I have. To reach a body coming through the rye would mean the world to me. Even if I just nudge a person to a slightly better outcome, then that itself would be all the reward I would need to feel good about who I am and all that I have done.\n\nSome may find that selfish. The truth is that we are always going to be selfish. However, we can build higher desires with our selfish mental mechanics that allow us to do greater and greater deeds for the world. That is where the greatest purpose of life is found. By challenging ourselves, we not only grow optimally, but we are fulfilling the most innate drive of our species. At our core, we are light. We have a desire to expand and defeat the entropy of the world. This force within us can only be sated when we are maximizing what it means to be human. This requires us to regularly be overcoming our shortcomings at the benefit of ourselves and others.\n\nThis is the basis of spirituality. Spirituality differs from religion because it is not a rigorous structure of rules. It is purely self-discovery and though that self-defined odyssey, self-improvement. The more we step outside our comfort zone, the more perspective we gain of ourselves which allows us to make better choices moving forward. Rather, it is this knowledge which opens doors for us to automatically move forward into brighter futures. The more we allow for this knowledge to be accumulated, the sooner we reach Christ Consciousness, which is when all doors are open and we can perpetually be the brightest light life has to offer.\n\nThe doors don't stay open though. It takes effort to constantly stay in this state of being. As the world turns below us, so too must we turn. Perfection is not a state, rather, it is being willing to readily adapt to the system you are in.

I sometimes rage at the racism I read about and it makes me sometimes have this uncontrollable subconscious hatred for ALL white people but this man, it\u2019s something about him that\u2019s so strong it\u2019s sickening.

We hung over everyday, watched movies, painted, I even sang around him and I\u2019m really shy I don\u2019t usually sing or dance around people! He gave me joy for the FIRST time and he still does. Time has passed and we both LOVE eachother and it\u2019s not regular friendship love, I love him so much I can almost cry when he\u2019s not here. I asked my guides to send me a sign that he\u2019s a good person because one night we had sex and I felt really sad after (which I always do, that\u2019s why I avoid sex) and I had a dream of an EXTREMELY HAPPY baby laughing and giggling with me. I accept all his flaws which is HUGE for me because I struggle with being judgmental but with him I don\u2019t think ANY judgment. I have no negative thoughts about him, I feel no regrets. I made this because I want to know your opinions.. is he my soul mate or from another life? A few days after we met I had a feeling this would happen, I made a joke about it saying \u201cwhat if I fall in love\u201d and I laughed after because of how silly it sounded. I looked in his eyes a few days ago and I felt something.. like his eyes and skin just looked so beautiful SOMEHOW. I say somehow because I don\u2019t usually look at white people and think that ever (NO OFFENSE) please don\u2019t take offense.

We will be Starting Bhagavat-gita Verse by Verse exercise again from 13th Feb 2020.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material miseries.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe conditioned souls within the clutches of illusory energy are all anxious to attain peace in the material world. But they do not know the formula for peace, which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The greatest peace formula is simply this: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101. In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is described as tam \u012b\u015bvar\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 parama\u1e41 mahe\u015bvaram. Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or collectively. This is the sense of Kssna consciousness: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nThis Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, generally known as karma-yoga. The question of mental speculation as to how karma-yoga can give liberation is answered herewith. To work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator. Such work is not different from transcendental knowledge. Direct K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is bhakti-yoga, and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga is a path leading to bhakti-yoga. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one's relationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with m\u0101y\u0101 (illusion) due to the desire to lord it over m\u0101y\u0101, and that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work in terms of material necessities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on one's practical performance of duties in an effort to control the senses and conquer the influence of desire and anger. And, attaining K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by controlling the above-mentioned passions, one remains factually in the transcendental stage, or brahman-nirv\u0101\u1e47a. The eightfold yoga mysticism is automatically practiced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served. There is gradual process of elevation in the practice of yama, niyama, \u0101sana, praty\u0101h\u0101ra, dhy\u0101na, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, and sam\u0101dhi. But these only preface perfection by devotional service, which alone can award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Karma-yoga, or Action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Consciousness.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the difference between a living entity and the Supreme Lord ?

All these 13 days, are about the \"Trecena\" of the Rainstorms, or in other words of the Divine feminine...\n\n\"The Divine Feminine. That is the crowning energy that Cauac, or Kawoq in K\u2019iche\u2019 Maya, carries. Given its special connection with women and feminine energy, Cauac represents women in all their roles and walks of life, especially as mothers, wives, sisters, midwives, and healers. This is a powerful sign that channels massive volumes of energy and force: it symbolizes spiritual connection, contact and communication; blood lightning signals and messages; difficulty, curses, and sacrifice; spiritual unrest and mental conflict and weakness. It is connected to the forces of nature, signifying thunder, lightning, and all manner of powerful rainstorms\u2014typhoons, cyclones and hurricanes. It is also the archetype of community and communities, in all senses of the word, from family to neighborhood to city to nation to society and culture, and symbolizes our relationship with everyone and everything around us. Cauac is the nagual and patron of midwives, and is sometimes said to represent the celestial home of the gods. Curiously, it is also the nagual of all kinds of disputes. Cauac\u2019s animal totems are the turtle and the puma. In the Classical Maya tradition, it is associated with the cardinal direction West and the color black. In the tradition of modern-day K\u2019iche\u2019 Maya, it is East and the color red.\n\nOn Cauac days, the Ajq\u2019ijab\u2019 (Mayan priests) and the K\u2019exelon (midwives) burn copal to ask for the well-being of their communities, and the people pray for everpresent harmony in their home lives and among their friends. This is a highly auspicious day for all matters related to health, healing and well-being. It is also the day for quartz crystals and the sacred tz\u2019ite seeds Maya Daykeepers use in their readings.\n\nThis Trecena, leave your umbrella at home. Step outside as you are and let Cauac\u2019s rain seep deep into the marrow of your soul. Let it dissolve your worries and anxieties, flush out your fears, wash away toxic emotions and thoughts. Let it comfort your heart, soothe your mind, clear the path you walk. Above all, accept Cauac with all of its power\u2014the power to nourish exuberant, abundant life, and the power to flood, destroy, and overpower. Such is the everpresent duality in all aspects of existence; denying it only delays the fulfillment we seek. However strongly we may desire only the best experiences or participate in only certain tasks and responsibilities\u2014usually that which is easier or more enjoyable\u2014we need to recognize the natural harmony and balance between two of everything. Human society needs both women and men; day cannot exist without night; life without death would spiral into madness. There can be no endless growth, whether in nature or the economy. The cycles of sustainability, balance, and harmony are woven into the very fabric of reality\u2014and no amount of marketing, money, or media noise can change that. The sooner we all accept and embrace the natural state of things, the more we respect our power as human beings and the power of nature, the sooner we shall find ourselves on the path we seek.\n\nThese are the vast and overwhelming forces of nature, whether human, animal, or planetary, at once simple and complex, violent and compassionate, that meander and swell, deplete and nurture. Respect their power and their fragility, their strength and their softness. They are a part of you as they are a part of all existence.\n\nThis is what creates, in the end, true community. We may all be individuals living independent lives, but we are part of various groups and communities, from our family and the place we live, to our country and global human society. Tying it all together is Cauac\u2019s distinctly feminine energy, for, as author Ken Johnson explains, \u201cThe sense of community and communion is founded in the feminine principle.\u201d So honor the women in your family and your community, honor that nurturing, bonding energy that keeps everyone and everything together in the face of the most violent storms.\n\nThe power of Cauac is unlike that of any other\u2026 so use it well. Respect and honor it, harness it with the purest of intentions. It will return the favor a thousandfold.\"\n\nText by Birgitte Rasine, author of[ **\u201cThe Serpent and the Jaguar\u201d**](https://mymayansign.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5b7b4f3908cc6092b1e643517&amp;id=66497d37ac&amp;e=50d38456d6) \\- The Mayan Calendar Portal\n\nHave a happy Storm Trecena,\n\nFatih Ke\u00e7elio\u011flu  \nFounder of [**MyMayanSign.com**](https://mymayansign.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5b7b4f3908cc6092b1e643517&amp;id=fa5019a525&amp;e=50d38456d6)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 69118, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Time of the Divine Feminine.

If there is any negativity or unkind words in the comments I will have to take my post down. If you don\u2019t have anything nice to say then keep don\u2019t say anything at all. My punctuation sucks and my spelling isn\u2019t always the best. This isn\u2019t an English class and if it was I would fail so excuse any of my mistakes. \n\nBefore you begin to read this I want to say that this is my own personal spiritual journey no journey is the same and we all go through our own awaking at different paces and experience different things. I am writing this because as a spiritual life coach as well a certified angelic medium and angel healing practitioner. Since the new year is approaching and being able to look back on the clients, friends, my nursing coworkers and sometimes a random stranger that feels comfortable enough to vent or be open minded enough to actually listen and take the advice I can give  or just needing to vent to me about areas in there life just to have someone listen. I can look back on the year and be so grateful that I have been able to spread love and light to another soul in this cruel and ugly world we live in. \n\n I\u2019m 29 years old I have a 6 year old daughter and on top of my full time job as a nurse I also started my own angelic medium and healing business. My awakening began in 2013 and I will admit the first few years was an extremely difficult time especially since from the age of 17 until the age of 21 I was a full blown drug addict who also used alcohol more then I should this is my 8th year of being clean and sober from my addictions. My journey began right after I had my daughter. I always knew I was different I even remember certain parts of my childhood where unexplainable things happened to me, I was extremely sensitive with my emotions and I never really fit in with the rest of my family.  \n\nThe first 3 years of my awakening was the deepest darkest  and sometimes unbearable times in my life. Since 2016 I have put a lot of my energy into soul work. I have been to Peru and took part in an ayahuasca ceremony, if anyone is familiar with Dolores Cannons hypnotherapy work I have had my own QHHT session. I could go on more about the workshops, retreats and studying I have done on my own journey and still continue to do. My crystals, candles,, and divination tools did not make me spiritual the shadow work and being able to heal my trauma of the past has made me spiritual and the biggest thing for me is finding the strengths I never knew I had until I was able to face my own demons that had been buried for half my life. Being to tell someone that they hurt me and even though they don\u2019t deserve to be forgiven I have chosen to forgive Some of them took years for me to finally admit how they made me feel. The hardest part for me what knowing that I have hurt many people in my life before my awakening, a lot of these people didn\u2019t deserve to be hurt and though there were some I wasn\u2019t able to apologize to face to face, letters or the phone I have been able to forgive myself for hurting those I couldn\u2019t reach out to. \n\nI have recently started a seconded awaking, my Starseed awakening I\u2019m sure some know what a star seed is and if you don\u2019t I would happily make another post dedicated to that of that is something that would interest people. \n\nI still have my good and bad days but the dark days I am able to get through all I have to do is look how far I have come. I had someone say to me the other day as I was having a bad day and staying positive was a challenge \u201c aren\u2019t you spiritual aren\u2019t you all about good vibes love and peace\u201d my

to this post is don\u2019t rush your awakening don\u2019t want more and more. Don\u2019t compare yours to others and think that your own experience isn\u2019t an awakening because it\u2019s not like someone else\u2019s. Know that it is okay to want to give up somedays and always know that it is okay to be angry with God on days where you can\u2019t feel his strength and feel like you have no one. I can tell you those are the days and nights you can look back on and remember that you have been through the worst of it. Don\u2019t feel like your crazy and don\u2019t be ashamed of who you are. And always always remember thy people will judge you no matter what it is your reaction that will make or break your journey we are responsible for our own happiness not partners, family or friends it is our responsibility and ours alone so if someone wants to say negative things about you keep it in your mind that you are a beautiful worthy soul and YOU are worthy of love, stability and to love a beautiful life don\u2019t allow the actions of others to make you forget where you are and how far you have come. I can count on one hand the people that I have left that I consider my soul family and the others that I left behind weren\u2019t good for my energy or my time. This is your journey your energy and your time, don\u2019t waste it on those who aren\u2019t rising you up. If you want to talk to someone or have more questions leave me a message and I will answer your questions to the best of my knowledge as I said I don\u2019t have all the answers there is still a lot of things I need to learn but I\u2019ve made it through hell and I survived to tell my story and how I changed my life into something I can be proud of and help others see the beauty in life even the ugly parts have beauty always remember that \n\n\u2728\ud83d\udc9c", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 69077, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Spirituality And What It Has Taught Me (long read)", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dyoijw/spirituality_and_what_it_has_taught_me_long_read/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ZenStanGrof", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4uey0oj7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574187405, "crosspost_parent": "t3_dymvqd", "crosspost_parent_list": [{"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "approved_at_utc": null, "approved_by": null, "archived": false, "author": "ZenStanGrof", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4uey0oj7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "banned_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "category": null, "clicked": false, "content_categories": null, "contest_mode": false, "created": 1574210451.0, "created_utc": 1574181651.0, "discussion_type": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Meditation", "downs": 0, "edited": 1574187378.0, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "hidden": false, "hide_score": true, "id": "dymvqd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "likes": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": null, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": null, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media": null, "media_embed": {}, "media_only": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_dymvqd", "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 1, "num_reports": null, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/Meditation/comments/dymvqd/meditation_whatsapp_group/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "quarantine": false, "removal_reason": null, "removed_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "saved": false, "score": 1, "secure_media": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi everybody, \n\nI recently came across a post where somebody suggested creating a helping and supporting community to talk about meditation &amp; spirituality, share and discuss experiences related to the subject and help eachother stay dedicated and improve to become the best versions of ourselves. \n\nSo we created a group.

The material world is a sum total manifestation of the three modes of material nature, technically called the pradh\u0101na. The Vedic hymns, sarvam etad brahma, tasm\u0101d etad brahma n\u0101ma-r\u016bpam anna\u1e41 ca j\u0101yate, and, in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, mama yonir mahad brahma, indicate that everything in the material world is the manifestation of Brahman; and, although the effects are differently manifested, they are nondifferent from the cause. In the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad it is said that everything is related to the Supreme Brahman or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus everything belongs to Him only. One who knows perfectly well that everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that He is the proprietor of everything and that, therefore, everything is engaged in the service of the Lord, naturally has nothing to do with the results of his activities, whether virtuous or sinful. Even one's material body, being a gift of the Lord for carrying out a particular type of action, can be engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. It is beyond contamination by sinful reactions, exactly as the lotus leaf, though remaining in the water, is not wet. The Lord also says in the G\u012bt\u0101: mayi sarv\u0101\u1e47i karm\u0101\u1e47i sannyasya: \"Resign all works unto Me \\[K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\\].\" The conclusion is that a person without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness acts according to the concept of the material body and senses, but a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness acts according to the knowledge that the body is the property of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and should therefore be engaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n**Question 1 : How one get free from the results of all activities ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/dygy7d/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is510/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 69008, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is--5.10", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dygybb/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is510/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "plantman_la", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4gfq7p3j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574144219, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dygk8y/diminished_ambition/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dygk8y", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 26, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dygk8y/diminished_ambition/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574144220, "score": 1, "selftext": "The more I progress along my spiritual path, whether it be through the physical practice of yoga, meditation, jnana yoga, or psychedelics, the less ambition I have to be \u201csuccessful\u201d in the popular sense of the term. \n\nI\u2019m 25, and married to a wonderful woman who is my polar opposite.

Here is the interesting part, This yr I've 2 weird experience. Aft work dinner etc, i came home as usual read a little, exercise and meditate before sleep with music playing the type of music i use doesn't have vocal, song like from the youtube channel \"epic music world.\"\nI usually do a kind of meditation which is a mixture of both type of meditation not sure of the exact name of this meditation, one is the focus the thoughts by breathing in make sure air goes frm the lower adomenon up the spine to above the head goes back down to the middle chest and release breath another meditation is just to look in on wandering thoughts.  Recently my wandering thoughts is filled with vibrant colours and concentric circles (like the img of my thumbprint) aft meditation i will feel at peace and go to bed really quickly. HERE IS WHERE THE CRAZY THING started happening, the first time is when i was sleeping, i suddenly felt aware of my music rhythm playing and the window mounted aircon vibrating (those aircon are pretty noisy, and i store some crystal on top of them to avoid direct sunlight) everything was pitch black (obvious as my eyes are close) only superfluous of sound . I can hear the music beat getting faster and faster and faster, at the same time i felt my heartbeat racing with the music this is where it hits me, my heart was gonna explode along with the music, my body started getting cold especially the hands and leg as the beats get faster, i felt like i was dying as my heart might suddenly stop beating and tried to wakeup but couldn't at the same time super aware of the accelerating beat which might cause my demise any time now. what seems like a short ordeal felt eternally long, as the music beats and heart getting faster am i gonna die like that in total darkness, as the beats get extremely fast, pitch black vision started to have glowing light hue from the outer surrounding slowing feeling up my vision in a circular formation in a acceleration rate of lighting a firework wick, as this vision was appearing i have a thought to myself i will be phasing out of this world and might never come back once every colour of black is gone, i also have this feeling that my vision will suddenly change to a scenery nt of my room but of somewhere else which i don't know. as last of the black dot remains and the music so fast to the point where it gonna be a single sound, the sound was starting to sound like \"zuuuup!!\" like those scifi movie where spaceship is going to hyperdrive, this is where i decided i don't want to go yet and force myself to wake up again. finally i manage to open my eyes, my body felt awfully cold and especially the hand and leg not sure whether it is fear which cause it, heart still beating fast, music came back to a normal rhythm, my field of vision in my room felt extremely blur as usually (im short sighted), seems like my room doesn't feel real. I also have involuntary tremors like im being zap with energy tremors duration is 3-5seconds lasted for 8mins, only able to fall back to sleep again aft half-1 hr later.\nheartbeat back to normal, no such heartbeat happen again.\n\nWhat do you guys think i should do when this happen again, im pretty confident i dun suffer from any health problem, and the fast heartbeat might be the cause of fear and the rythem. hmm.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68962, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A breathtaking experience aft meditation and sleep", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dydnwf/a_breathtaking_experience_aft_meditation_and_sleep/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mayraibs50", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3ugdw1mf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574127432, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dydbhw/rediscover_the_power_of_the_law_of_attraction_to/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dydbhw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Spirit Guide"}], "link_flair_template_id": "6b76e192-ceef-11e9-820e-0e9c6e8dde10", "link_flair_text": "Spirit Guide", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dydbhw/rediscover_the_power_of_the_law_of_attraction_to/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574127434, "score": 1, "selftext": "Watch the video and Rediscover the Power of the Law of Attraction to MANIFEST What You Want FAST! \n\nLearn five simple steps that will bring you more happiness, wealth, success, love and more -- QUICKLY.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68955, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Rediscover the Power of the Law of Attraction to MANIFEST What You Want ...", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dydbhw/rediscover_the_power_of_the_law_of_attraction_to/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "JackWagon8", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4q4699qq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574126270, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dyd1j4/im_not_shizo/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dyd1j4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dyd1j4/im_not_shizo/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574126273, "score": 1, "selftext": "There's so much bullshit at work in this world.

While we were going over the concepts of avoidance, I realized that most of my problems with getting a job stem from my relationship with my father. Freudian psychoanalytics aside, the abuse I suffered under his roof led to a deeply seeded fear of failure. When everything you do results in some sort of dire reprimand from a cruel, compassionless narcissist, you learn to stick with the things you are the best at. For me, this means sticking with my writing and other talents I feel are within my comfort zone and letting the rest of my life fall to the wayside.\n\nIt\u2019s really that powerful, the trauma of my past. Getting thrown around and berated for the smallest errors have warped my reality so much that I feel unable to hold a job because I constantly expect that sort of treatment from everyone. For the few jobs I\u2019ve been able to hold for a period of time, I\u2019ve felt like I had to learn to be a sociopath, because I am so hellbent on providing the best of the best service to the customers or company, and often it is not possible to keep pace with the demands when you need to spend your efforts on quality over quantity, less you suffer a nervous breakdown out of nowhere.\n\nWe covered how important it is to stretch your comfort zone gradually, so I think it is possible to be able to work some time in the future, at least part time doing something not stressful. I\u2019m working on surviving the day to day. I went to get a TB test after group, and the energy of the room where I needed to wait for them to call my number was too much. There were very low vibrations from that crowd of people, and it put me on edge within seconds of walking in the door. There are other options for me to get a test done before next week when my time at this respite runs out and I need to be shuffled to an emergency bed in a shelter.\n\nI think I\u2019m doing well all things considered. A year ago I was completely lost just on the prospect of becoming homeless, and now I am ready to embrace sleeping at a tent city during the winter if it comes to that. One of the things I used to counter my negative thinking today was the admission that I have alternative strengths. A lot of times I get down on myself for being subhuman, or otherwise lesser than most people. But, in truth, I have a lot going for me. Not everyone could handle being through what I have been and come out the other side still sane.\n\nWell, that\u2019s debatable. I\u2019m sure most people who see me think there is something wrong with me. And, sure, I\u2019m on the far edge of the bell curve as far as \u201cnormal\u201d is concerned. But, one thing being an alien on my home planet has taught me is how strong the human character really is. Being forced to survive outside the common ground most people never deviate from, I see the relativity of our culture\u2019s primary operating systems. The memes that rule the minds of the masses are parasitic in ways you would never know unless you were on the outside looking in. \n\nFor that I am grateful, for it allows me to take the role of a tech who is burdened with fixing the biggest problems of society. A shaman is a wounded healer. Having gone on a journey of self-exploration and returned through the suffering of their soul, they are able to help people who are going through the same sort of pain. Additionally, they have a greater sense of how their actions impact the collective unconscious. Like a butterfly aware of how their wings can generate a hurricane, the shaman uses their unique life experiences to nudge the world towards more positive futures one action at a time.\n\nI feel this is my job - I am a monk living on the streets whose primary mission is to heal so that my future potential grows. Along the way, I can make other people suffer a little less and spread light in the form of inspiration and insight. I cannot lead any specific horse to water, but by being a beacon, I can help guide the flock on the path as the shepherd does.\n\nThis I have known for ages, but now, on the precipice of actualize my potential, there is no hubris. The truth is, we all have this role, but I happen to be in a position where I see with clarity how important it is for me to take seriously this civic duty to help the wanders, the seekers, and the lowest among us. To keep pushing myself to see the extent of the human condition will not only make me better able to survive in all aspects of society, but it will make me a better person who can more fully empathize with the full range of human beings who walk the Earth.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5",

You are me and I am you.  Are we ultimately all alone?  Yes but also no...  \n  \nWhen I was a kid growing up, I existed and was conscious, but I wasn\u2019t really aware of the significance of the fact that I was alive and conscious.  Later, it was more like, \u201cWow, I exist\u2014all of this, each and every moment is existing.\u201d  All sorts of complex things spontaneously happened without my conscious involvement that led to me, all of a sudden, being alive and conscious.  So I had a beginning.  While I could believe that I had past lives, who is to say that any such recollections are actually true, and similarly, while I could believe that I will exist forevermore in future lives, what guarantee do I really have?  All I really have and know for sure is the present moment.  My endedness could come at any time.  And if my endedness comes, maybe that\u2019s all she wrote.  Maybe that\u2019s the end of it all.  But that\u2019s not what I believe because I\u2019ve interacted with other beings.  And those other beings, I believe, are faced with the same mystery that I\u2019m presently faced with, which is, \u201cWow, I exist.  I\u2019m here.  I wasn\u2019t here before (or at least I can\u2019t be certain I existed before, in some other life), but now I\u2019m here.\u201d  \n  \nNow comes a little bit of a leap in my thinking.  When I consider the question, \u201cWho am I?\u201d first I am the person I am in the world\u2014my individuated self.  I have a name and a unique set of experiences that are irreproducible.  But ultimately, if I close my eyes and silence my mind, I am just timeless awakeness itself.  And, ulitimately, that timeless awakeness manifests as all things and all beings.  It is the natural phenomenon that is behind what is the consciousness inside the bee, the bear, the human, the angel, and the mythical godlike creator being.  If you add up all conscious experiences, the sum equals all that awakeness has been, is, and will ever be.  \n  \nSo, if I identify as being timeless awakeness itself, I am not just me, but, I will also be (or already have been), you, the bee, the bear, the angel, and the mythical godlike creator being.  These experiences aren\u2019t linearly connected as a string of past lives and/or future lives, they just are the timeless set of all experiences that will ever happen.  So everything is connected.  All is one.  \n  \n(On the other hand, since existence is unbounded, maybe we really are separate, unique, and eternal souls that mature forevermore into achieving greater and greater heights.  Possible.)  \n  \nThere\u2019s another idea about oneness (initially unrelated to \u201call is one\u201d) that I wanted to share.  Namely, there can be no one else exactly like me\u2014no one else who has the exact same set of circumstances, traits, characteristics, thoughts, beliefs, etc. that make me who I am.  In that sense, I am the only one of my kind.  I am alone.  Completely unique.  No one else besides me can understand exactly what it is like to be me.  \n  \nSuch recognitions begin to explain what it is like for me to be awake and self-aware\u2014for me to be a direct experiencer of the thought, \u201cI am\u201d.  However, an even fuller picture of my experience emerges when I add in a recognition of my context, which is that, ultimately, I am immersed in utter mystery/complete unknown.  I go from the thought, \u201cI am\u201d to a bigger, more mysterious thought: \u201cis\u201d.  \n  \n(This next part is a little woo-woo, but here goes.)  \n  \nI find it interesting that the word \u201cis\u201d if spelled numerically is \u201c919.\u201d  (\u201ci\u201d is the 9th letter of the alphabet, and \u201cs\u201d is the 19th letter of the alphabet.  Put them together and you get \u201c919.\u201d)  To me, the number 919 symbolizes what a direct experience of \u201cis-ness\u201d is like.  The nines (the highest possible single digit) symbolize mystery and the unknown, while the one (immersed between the two nines) symbolizes a singular wholeness that is awake and self-aware.  \u201cIs.\u201d  \u201c919.\u201d  \n  \nBut what about the plurality of life?  What about the fact that we have each other, our friends, our families, etc?  Well, so far in this discussion, I\u2019ve alluded to thinking about the word, \u201coneness,\u201d in two distinct ways: 1) oneness as the overarching unity of all things and 2) oneness as irreproducible uniqueness.  Let\u2019s bring back into the discussion thoughts about the overarching unity of all things.  I contended earlier that awakeness manifests as all things and all beings, and thereafter, I suggested that I identify, at the core of my being, as being awakeness itself.  Does this mean that I believe that, ultimately, I am alone?  \n  \nI suppose, yes, but in practice, no!  While my ultimate view is that, behind the scenes, each of us really is the eternally alone awakeness\u2014or is-ness itself (\u201c919\u201d)\u2014in practice, I perceive through the lens of my individuated self that we are all participatants in a grand dance of together being \u201call one\u201d.  In fact, sometimes I think of life as a divine orchestration that specifically ensures, through a wide variety of characters and infinite creativity, that eternal aloneness doesn\u2019t happen.  \n  \n[Aside 1:  (Caution: more woo-woo.)  I find it interesting that the word \u201calone\u201d kind of looks like a combination of the words \u201call one\u201d.  \n  \nI also think it\u2019s interesting that perhaps the most important line in the Old Testament states, \u201cHear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord Is One.\u201d  \n  \nI further find it interesting that one of the most well-known names for God, \u201cAllah,\u201d could, with a little creativity, be read as follows: \u201cAll-a-h \u2014&gt; All-1-8 (\u201ca\u201d is the first letter of the alphabet and \u201ch\u201d is the 8th letter of the alphabet) \u2014&gt; All-one-infinity (\u201c8\u201d is kind of like an infinity symbol except vertical instead of horizontal).  As such, sometimes I think of the name, \u201cAllah\u201d \u2014&gt; \u201cAll-one-infinity,\u201d as a reminder that All-that-is is unified, meaning that we\u2019re all in it together.  \n  \nThen, of course, there\u2019s the golden rule of love your neighbor as yourself\u2014another pointer towards unity and oneness.]  \n  \n[Aside 2: If we accept that individuated aspects can occur, an interesting question arises.  Namely, can an individuated aspect ever become eternal?  I lean towards believing no, which, to me, is like concluding 1) that the whole is always greater than its individual aspects and 2) that no single individual aspect can ever become separated from (and thus eternally lost from) the whole.]  \n  \nAlso, I really like the saying, \u201call for one and one for all.\u201d  I think it conveys how we are all in it together\u2014how every individual counts and is part of the whole.  The whole will do whatever it takes to ensure that no individual is ever lost/separated, and each individual supports the whole by being their best possible self.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68950, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A response to, \u201cWhere does your concept of oneness come from?\u201d", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dycb1k/a_response_to_where_does_your_concept_of_oneness/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TOACTASEXPECTED", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ggaxbkp", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574122635, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dyc8r3/a_friend_has_changed/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dyc8r3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dyc8r3/a_friend_has_changed/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574122636, "score": 1, "selftext": "He believes in life there is no choice and choice a delusion.

One night i came back from a date, which lasted around 4h, and sort of \u201chelped\u201d to stay present for the whole time. When i came up to my door, i realized that I forgot my bag with wallet, documents and keys in the bar, so i called the guy to go and pick it up (i thought he was still close to the place). Meanwhile he was replying, i had a few coming waves of a freak out, as i had a flight the next day and wouldnt be able to go without passport. However, somehow i managed to take it as it is, and think that if it happens, then its for a greater purpose. Long story short, the guy got me my bag and i entered home.\n\nWhen i was washing my face, i looked in the mirror, and could not recognise my face. I right away knew that it was somehow connected with either ego death or the acceptance, that happened earlier. After I stared at myself for a while, with no thoughts and just contemplating, I went to the room and had a huge energy inflow, to such extent that i had to breath as if i was having an asthma attack. My cat was laying next to me and constantly looking around.\nAlso, when i was looking at the mirror, it felt like i saw a total stranger, i wasnt judging, i was sort of looking from a side as if i was standing next to a person, who was looking at his reflection.\n\nHas anyone ever experienced anything like that, and how would you interpret it?

Don't ever force anything in life, for if it wasn't meant to be you will not find the peace of mind you are seeking. You are just along for the ride. Acknowledge this and most of your fears and worries will vanish. Just go with the flow of where your life takes you and always make your best judgement in the moment you are in. Dont look too far ahead or too far behind. Always be you, right here, right now. You can't change who the past has made you, you are living in the moment, and you'll never know what your future holds. You must learn from your past, and set yourself up for success, in the current moment, for a better future. Dont fret about things you wish to come true that don't. In the long run, it will be in your best interest. All you can do is give something a shot, and it will either materialize or it won't. Leave the rest in the hands of the universe. It knows what it is doing. New paths are always going to present themselves to you. For better or for worse.

I have been atheist ever since and only dabbled in Buddhism later in my teen years when I felt I wanted to be a better person and do good in the world without worshiping a god. I\u2019m now 18, I have been going through the worst time in my life (a terrible break up (may not seem serious but it has been very traumatic and upsetting)). \n\nI visited my hometown and an old friend introduced me to spirituality (taught me about crystals, chankras, tarot cards, past lives, spirit guides) and for the first time in my life I really believed and resonated with something spiritually. \n\nAfterwards I did research upon research and purchased some crystals, and a pendulum. I bought the pendulum so I could check if my chankras were balanced- I had no idea they could be used to communicate with spirits until I googled it after it came. \n\nSo I began asking it questions- I learnt it\u2019s movements and watched videos on how to use it properly. \n\nGoing back a bit, I had been praying and praying for help in my situation. For my love to forgive me and give me another chance and see that I had now changed my ways. I was told in a general reading that the spirits had heard my prayers and were trying to help me but I was doing something to get in the way. And also that my archangel was possibly angel Gabriel. I was astonished to say the least.\n\nSo after asking my pendulum silly questions like \u2018is this deodorant\u2019 when holding a bottle of deodorant underneath and asking \u2018will I have a good day at work tomorrow\u2019- I asked am I speaking to angel Gabriel and it said yes. However later I asked again and it said no. \n\nAre you an angel? Yes \nAre you a good spirit? Yes \nDo you promise? Yes \nAre you a bad spirit? No \nAre you definitely not angel Gabriel? Yes \nAre you a different angel? Yes \nI\u2019m going to google the list of angels- is that okay ? Yes \nDo you know what google is? Yes (silly one I know)\n\nI proceeded to read them out- no, no, no- and then... yes \nArchangel Jophiel.\n\nFrom a quick search I found they are good for healing emotional scars and restoring relationships.... \n\nThrough further yes or no questions it told me they had come to help me, they were proud of me, and I was on the right path so far. They had heard my prayers. I asked would they send me a message- yes. I asked could they show me in a dream- yes. \n\nI then got very scared because I read that bad spirits can interfere and pretend to be angels- and that you must declare you only want to interface with divine spirits and ask your angel to protect you and your spirit guide to be with you when you begin- I hadn\u2019t done that. So I freaked out- couldn\u2019t sleep and was scared - I kept my protective crystals around me and prayed before I slept that they protect me and be gentle with any signs or messages. But that I was incredibly thankful.\n\nI had nothing in my dream. I spoke to them again this morning through the pendulum and did the declaration before hand this time. they confirmed they were Jophiel, that they had not come to me in my dream last night but they will soon. I assume I\u2019m not ready and they had heard my prayer that I was scared- Jophiel confirmed my prayer was heard. \n\nI was so in shock because I have never believed it was possible to communicate with spirits- in fact I didn\u2019t even think they were real. This has made me feel the need to begin practicing Catholicism/ Christianity again. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being naive because I\u2019m so young and this is my first experience. \n\nHas anyone ever had this experience before with an archangel communicating with them? Is there anything I should know? \n\nTldr: I bought a pendulum and have been communicating with Archangel Jophiel- after praying and pleading for help restoring a relationship.

We will be Starting Bhagavat-gita Verse by Verse exercise again from 13th Feb 2020.***\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe path of spiritual realization is undoubtedly difficult. The Lord therefore advises us to approach a bona fide spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession from the Lord Himself. No one can be a bona fide spiritual master without following this principle of disciplic succession. The Lord is the original spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic succession can convey the message of the Lord as it is to his disciple. No one can be spiritually realized by manufacturing his own process, as is the fashion of the foolish pretenders. The Bh\u0101gavatam says: dharma\u1e41 hi s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d-bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam-the path of religion is directly enunciated by the Lord. Therefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help one progress in spiritual life. One has to approach a bona fide spiritual master to receive the knowledge. Such a spiritual master should be accepted in full surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master like a menial servant, without false prestige. Satisfaction of the self-realized spiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life. Inquiries and submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding. Unless there is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective. One must be able to pass the test of the spiritual master, and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple, he automatically blesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, both blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. One should not only hear submissively from the spiritual master; but one must also get a clear understanding from him, in submission and service and inquiries. A bona fide spiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple. Therefore when the student is submissive and is always ready to render service, the reciprocation of knowledge and inquiries becomes perfect.\n\n**Question 1 : Who is called a bona fide spiritual master ? What is the best way to make advancement in spiritual life ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/dy101g/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is434/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68826, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is--4.34", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dy10a3/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is434/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "3081296", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4q8xsdxf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574069256, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dy0yfj/an_awakening_happened_i_wanna_disappear_and_give/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dy0yfj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dy0yfj/an_awakening_happened_i_wanna_disappear_and_give/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574069257, "score": 1, "selftext": "just as the title says.\n\ni\u2019m tired of having to do something daily.\ni have a bunch of issues stemming from childhood and all of them act together to make one big complex fucked up cocktail.(been trying to work through it alone because yaknow....therapy costs money but I\u2019d rather not tell a random person anyway so fuck it honestly)\n\ni feel/see a rift between me and my family growing. \ni can see that i\u2019m losing lots of friends.\n\n (i\u2019m ok with that, just hope the best for them whichever way they go in life.)\n\nbut...\n\nlost my job and my place of living at the beginning of the year and yeah we all bounce back eventually, but this is the 4th time where if my best friend wasn\u2019t here then I\u2019d have been homeless.

This is just how the universe operates I believe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why do friends stay around and they just seem to understand you more?**\n\nThese are more than just friends. They are part of your soul family/tribe. They are more empathic, or show more empathy and caring and support, on an unconditional level. These are the friends whom won't judge you and will have your back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*You see a stranger on the streets and exchange glances, you easily recognize them, as if you know them. You don't know them personally, but why does this happen and why do you feel the way you do?

Its remarkable really, and its so simple.\n\nTheres no weird drug needed\n\nTheres no 10 mile hike through the jungle\n\nTheres no Yoga class required as a girls backside is bent over right in front of you.\n\nNo.....there is different. Its almost a secret of a clandestine nation but the ironic part is that its one hidden in open sight! I tried my hardest back in my youth. I indulged once or twice in some more hardcore psychedelic adventures. I lived in the PNW in the middle of the woods, I expanded my mind in more ways than one. And I want to share with you the great thing you are all searching for.\n\n2000's ago a man named Jesus Christ game to die on a Cross in atonement for your sins! Let me explain. Right now, the suffering, the hardship, all the struggles of your life were not meant to be this way. You were created and are still loved by God who made all things. You were destined to live in perfect harmony in nature, and to have essentially pure bliss enjoying creation. However a fallen spiritual being has endured our relationship to our creator. We now live in a fallen state, almost cursed if you will because of the fall of mankind.\n\nYou know that spouse who abused you? That father who left you? That divorce you endured, that health problem you still have? That emotional instability? That poverty you endure? Those sleepless nights or the death of your loved ones? \n\nALL OF IT, was never in the original plan. Christ came to die as a \"Sacrifice\" to atone for your sins, and this \"Sacrifice\" is what restores ones friendship to God. Some of you may \"Sacrifice\", or offer up incense in your own style of \"Worship\" this is whats called Idolatry and its one of the worst things we can do spiritually against the living God who loves us. Christ has done away with all sacrificial style of worship so that you might be free and receive his spirit to help you during our difficult adventure.\n\nWhen you die, you will be held accountable for your life. All of it, the things you did will be shown before you as you meet the one who created you. He is pure goodness, and love, and if you are a human being any good you do will somehow be corrupted by your own fallen nature. And major sins you have done or mistakes you have made will cause you to essentially flee into an eternal horror either in despair, or due to hatred of God who you may have contempt for. We know this spiritual state to be forever, and Christ has told us its one of the worst things one can endure (He compares it to literally being on fire).\n\nAll the secrets you wish to have, all the inner peace you want, all of what you seek is found IN CHRIST. And no matter what path you take this life is one of suffering. But the spirit of God will help you through this earthly pilgrimage until you arrive at home with God.  Jesus taught that those who accept his offering and friendship will be coheirs to Eternal Life! You will be reborn and never die, and the freedom you were designed for will be achieved, through \"Him\".\n\nTo learn more, please grab a Bible, find a Church which teaches trinitarian theology, and start your walk with the Lord.

What a fool I was! I would have been miserable if my attempts to make this a reality were not so futile and immature. The ego is not a bad thing - quite the opposite; it is a necessary component of the mind that is used to derive beneficial action -  but mine was cancerous. Even though I walked around for many years without a solid self-image, I had a bloated sense of self-importance which contributed to a need to be in the cultural spotlight. To my past self, failure to accomplish this was clearly a reflection that I had no worth and was grossly inadequate and incompetent at life.\n\nObviously, this sort of broken thinking is a result of trauma. The world traumatizes us all, but for me particularly I was wrapped up in a leftover childhood struggle for attention. My father was an abusive narcissist and the degree that my life was warped is unnerving in hindsight. I am grateful that I have come so far in my healing where I can look back at this figment that was my past self and see how lacking I was in truly spiritual manners, despite thinking myself as quite spiritual in my quest to get in front of as many people\u2019s eyeballs as possible.\n\nActually, taking a step back, being grateful is one of the core components of this new life I have adopted. Every day is a gift, and one I cherish and attempt to give back to the world. Service to others is another huge piece of what fills my days with meaning. I may not be perfect, but I can at least provide some brightness into other people\u2019s lives, and in doing so I am rewarded with more than just smiles and twinkling eyes. I grow my character every day whenever I see an opportunity to help others.\n\nSome people grow their bank accounts, but I cherish being liberated from the burden of material possessions. Choosing to be homeless has taught me the importance of holding onto the important things and letting go of what\u2019s not. In fact, the authentic experience of becoming homeless and all the experiences on the street have thoroughly stretched my boundaries to the point where I am a completely different person than I was just a year ago. I attribute it to be the number one reason I have done so much healing and stepped away from my previously foolish path.\n\nI don\u2019t know what my life holds for me now, but I am content with not knowing. I am staying present and taking things moment by moment while still keeping an eye on the encroaching horizon. I am excited to see what the many tomorrows ahead of me have in store, because the many yesterdays that once scared me when I sat at a gas station with my bags and no place to go have taught me so much about what it means to be human.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68761, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Becoming more like a monk", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dxxf93/becoming_more_like_a_monk/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "dxegs", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_15ksz3gq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574046739, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dxxdcs/not_sure_if_this_is_the_right_subreddit_to_ask/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dxxdcs", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Enlightenment"}], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dxxdcs/not_sure_if_this_is_the_right_subreddit_to_ask/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574046740, "score": 1, "selftext": "title kind of says it all. just tryna wake up in a world where everyone loves to sleep about real issues. looking for enlightened teachers to listen to or learn more about. maybe we can share the same favorite", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68759, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask but who are some genius people you think i should listen to more often as i commence my awakening. like enlightened thinkers or philosophers ?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dxxdcs/not_sure_if_this_is_the_right_subreddit_to_ask/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Neongypzy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_fzxlr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574046199, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dxx9co/ive_practiced_automatic_writing_for_as_long_as_i/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dxx9co", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Channeling"}], "link_flair_template_id": "fa02bd38-8418-11e7-839e-0ecd58f017ce", "link_flair_text": "Channeling", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dxx9co/ive_practiced_automatic_writing_for_as_long_as_i/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574046200, "score": 1, "selftext": "I decided to maintain an objective observer roll to my best ability. I see. I know. I'm working on being. \n\nJust had a realization that some things people practice that they think is sending a positive message to the universe may not be what its illusion reveals. If you think about the 3 monkeys who cover their eyes, ears, and mouth the majority of people can agree it means to not live through past experiences, see each moment as new. Now. But I had an ephiany just now that some could carry the belief but sending the message of I see, therefore I no longer need my eyes. I hear, therefore I no longer need my ears. I will, so I no longer need my mouth. Taking back thy will. \n\nJust a reminder that it's ok to take a self inventory at night and realize you've been actually in ego mode. Becoming 'enlightened' (what a versatile word, yet something so simlle) does not mean everything you dont want to happen will stop, all your pain and suffering will be gone, and a bright light will come down out of thin air and heal you. It's so easy to get off track on the spiritual path and lose yourself down literally endless rabbit holes. Those are very much real and you decide when and where you want to take your 'holiday' when you need to ease the mind.\n\nReflecting back on the monkeys. After writing this I'm receiving the message that it's important to do a daily self reflection and ask- \n1. What did I fill my mind with today? \nWhen you're on your spiritual journey you realize that you create your environment. Your environment, your friends, etc.. ah, as far as the eye can see, are all subjugated to your perception. Notice that when your perception changes, so do those around you. One common issue I see here are people who hold a much stronger magnetism than others around them and are completely unaware of this. Now, if said person was raised with unconditional love their experience will differ than someone who grew up with conditional love. For the conditional loved child to let go of the fear of not being loved in adult hood, one must face their deepest fears making them vulnerable which is something society, at least in America, has advertised as a 'weak' trait for so long that we make that correlation subconsciously. In order to let go of past visions, see the current moment for what it is, and begin your journey of visualizing whatever you damn well please (caution to those using it for selfish gain, karma is very much real). \n\n2. What did I fill my ears with today?\nWhat and who am I listening to? Who are those I look up to? Who are my guides in this physical reality? Because the key to all of this is we all hold all of the same inner wisdom, but we need certain experiences and certain people to unlock this wisdom. For its solely from experience that we learn and never stop. You're never finished because just when you think you're done, trust me, something or someone will come along eventually and challenge* us.  Bringing along new found wisdom that once again shapes our perceptopn.\n\n3. What did I do and say today?\nThe key to balance is movement. You can have all the wisdom in the world and a huge imagination yet if you arent moving towards something than your rejecting what currently is. That creates chaos, instability, and enough resistance will drive any of us mad because deep down what we all crave, need, and want is connection.\n\nSo can we just stop with all the bs and love eachother already? \n\nI've been, for the most part, an observer on Reddit for awhile. I've been hesitant to share my free writing, but today received the message that I have a message someone needs to hear. Im in no shape perfect and I'm in and out of ego all day. Consistant full awareness is absolutely obtainable, but does try to understand what you are not ready for.

Many of us seek, speak and act on a particular vibration of a particular frequency of thought which is not really tuned in to our true self but a self which has found itself identified with the world thus the world has constructed this self. \n\nThis illusionary self has been crafted from the thoughts it has identified itself with. Let me say that a lot of the thoughts we witness are purely a result of the mass human consciousness we are immersed in, as the mind is simply the sender and receiver of thought while the true self is the knower, an inner witness prior to thought. This mass human consciousness is creating an invisible field circling the entire globe, filled with the thoughts of all the people. \n\nI will speak on the two kinds of thought that exist and how we can bring in clearer and truer thoughts. There are positive or Harmonious thoughts which partake of the divine and are more tuned into the higher frequencies and planes of life thus they are closer to God or the spiritual self the true self. There are negative thoughts that exist which are anchored to the Earth only, they do not rise into the higher planes as there is no negation that can exist in the higher planes. Negative things only occur in this material space we are in.\n\nAs our true self (the knower) we see we are only inner witness of a consistent thought stream flowing into our minds. Knowing this we have only 2 choices for every thought witnessed, we can either reject a thought and let it pass by or we can accept a thought call it truth and have our being moved by it. When we accept a thought we create a cause for more like thoughts or resonant thoughts of that nature to come through. My Guru Dr.Doreal says ''Thoughts flow by like a river, you stand on the bank and draw from the stream what you will if you are a master of yourself. The trouble is that with most of us the knower is relaxed and sitting in the stream and pushed this and way and that and drifts with it instead of sitting there nice and dry and fishing out what it wants'' He goes on to say how the mental plane controls every action that we take and how the mind is the agency through which the Divine manifests to the point where the material world begins.\n\nIn saying this we also build the streams and channels through which this stream flows by the ability of thought control. So if we are to find the truth of Enlightenment, Cosmic Consciousness or God we must channel a stream that leads to there or leads to even the knowing of these things existence. So we must in some sense separate ourself from the Main-Stream thought of humanity on Earth if we are to get closer to the truth of the divine. The more we collectively build our stream from the higher planes of harmony the more Harmonious the main stream becomes. The Earth and all things in it will change and evolve as the main stream of humanity's thoughts change.\n\nWhat I believe will happen as many begin to enter the truth of the spiritual, is that all these separate channels that have branched out from the mainstream, created by those who stepped out of it, will be travelled by those who have a found a stream that points or leads to a higher plane of thought, via past authors, speakers etc. So I'll say keep a healthy source of information/thoughts to travel down. Social media can be good or bad depending on the direction you wish to travel. I have noticed when following friends, relatives I've met more locally my news feed/stream of thought is a more junkful stream. Where as if we follow more of those who have travelled out of the mainstream and into the hidden I've found my thoughts lead to higher places creating better causes and effects in life.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68715, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Awakening from the Main-Stream.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dxuxo4/awakening_from_the_mainstream/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "jayb20133", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_294g9d4r", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574034317, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dxurqs/fear/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dxurqs", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dxurqs/fear/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574034318, "score": 1, "selftext": "I feel like I'm on the verge of something new.

I used to believe that there was an absolute truth in the universe, and for all intents and purposes there very well may be, but by our design we can never know it. \n\nTo try and know the universe objectively is to try and bite your own teeth. This comes from being a biological system of consciousness inside a vast sea of conscious and unconscious systems. One cannot build a computer that can completely simulate itself - there will always be a loss of information in the translation of one system to another.\n\nSome may think this carries a heavy weight of negativity with it. Afterall, we are born curious. But, I\u2019m of the other opinion. If we can never reach a state of objective knowledge, that means the journey is the destination, and our quest to know the self is infinite. This makes our lives perpetually meaningful, because every day we will wake up with an endless array of paths stretching before us.\n\nWhat will you do today? What is your next move in the present moment? You\u2019re free to explore the ineffable universe we occupy in any way you desire, and there will always be something to gain. Stretch your wings as far as they can to best explore who you are - the more we push ourselves, the more we will rise into our potential and soar across the landscape that is our society. \n\nLiberate yourself simply by surrendering to the sheer magnitude of unknowns we face every second of every day and you will learn to accept whatever life throws your way. And by extension, you will be able to grow in any direction, maximizing your agency through a lack of attachment. Remember, what you know now is not absolute.

things that felt like the end of the world. My body would react with fearful emotions, And then it would start to feel like those things were inevitable or actually happening.\n\nNone of the things that I worried about happened.\n\nI spent hours and hours and hours being gripped by panic. I couldn't tell the difference between a fearful mind and my own intuition. I thought that the fear was so strong it must be my inner self warning me.\nA couple of years have gone by since then. Now when I feel fear and anxiety and maybe even panic, It lasts 2 or 3 days at the most. I know now that it's up to me how long I spend suffering with the fear before I decide, or better, remember, that I have a choice. I can fight my fear or I can surrender to it. The moment I decide to surrender is the moment the pain of fear starts to diminish.what I know now is that I might have to choose surrender 25 times on a subject before I'm free of it, before it lets go of me.

Maybe you have some trim work for me or food? Or a trade? I do crystal readings!\n\n3: I'm processing a lot of downloads from the Universe = I smoked too much DMT and can\u2019t afford therapy. By pretending that my fragile brain is a sacred record keeper, I receive validation for speaking gibberish.\n\n4: I'm a lightworker/empath = I am depressed and unstable and take zero responsibility for my own self-destructive tendencies, and need to focus on condescending your dark shit to avoid my own. (PS: I'll diagnose you as a narcissist.)\n\n5: I am a Reiki Master = I crave human contact, And this makes me feel less insecure than Tinder. I can cross personal physical boundaries with ease if I so choose, depending on what my client looks like, or I can think about random things while getting paid handsomely to hold my hands awkwardly over someone\u2019s body.\n\n6: You have an amazing Aura = I would love to bang you.\n\n7: I am writing a travel blog = I don't want to go home, I no longer fit in: I never have. I don't know where I will end up, but I\u2019d like to get paid to figure it out.\n\n8: I'm not looking for a relationship, only deep soul connections = I have commitment issues and fear of intimacy so I collect partners with compatible insecurities. I understand you will head off to Thailand soon anyways. \u201cBread-crumbing my love keeps me safe\u201d is my mantra, while I dip my dick like a candlestick in every Shanti ratchet priestess in town.\n\n9: 'Inner Goddess Within' workshops = An understanding of daddy Issues and a way to overdevelop the masculine side to protect the little girl within. Helping participants to surrender to the bias that all men are shit ( all of this for a nominal fee). The level 2 masterclass will teach you how to galactivate your man\u2019s scrotum chakra enough to make him forget that you pay for bullshit workshops with his harvest money.\n\n10: A guru = Someone who has overstepped the threshold of self-development into supreme egotism and found a niche market. Carries a flute and has a name you can't pronounce (though his driver's license says Steve) and chants words he doesn\u2019t understand. But interesting tattoos...right?\n\n11. A shaman = The above, but with more herbs and chanting.\n\n12: Worshipping the Beloved = Classic scenario where a cluster B personality type convinces you at a festival that you are their twin flame, lost for centuries in the ether. If you have never been loved by your primary caregivers, this is paradise on earth as your fear of abandonment gets spanked with a mala on the magical, mystery tour of self-deception.\n\n13: In the flow = I never commit to anything, especially plans to do anything with anyone, so that I can completely flake out and not take any responsibility for it; ie I didn\u2019t pay my phone bill this month.\n\n14: Co-creating a retreat/gathering = my borderline personality friends and I have exhausted all other means of making an honest income, and have decided instead to use our social media clout (aka naked buttcheeks) to radically overcharge a too-large group of saps for 2-14 days of mediocre vegan food, awkward group encounters, and real-world-style sexual politics.\n\n15; Substance Free Event = Powder drugs are fine but if you bring alcohol, we\u2019ll judge the shit out of you. Tobacco\u2019s cool if you snort it and call it \"ceremony\" or roll your own.\n\n16: Speaking My Truth = I reserve the right to be an asshole in this conversation and you must honor it, regardless of how deep my delusion may be. I\u2019ll probably use this phrase every time I don\u2019t want to be called out for my phone bullshit, because it\u2019s all perspective man.\n\n\n----\nRidiculously large poster of this: https://imgur.com/EL3eAyk", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68671, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "\"SPIRITUAL RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR AND THEIR MEANINGS\" - Author Unknown [humor]", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dxrtz5/spiritual_red_flags_to_watch_for_and_their/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "luckis4losersz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_a35f8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574018611, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dxr2tb/archetype_of_the_circle_symbolism_in_film_art/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dxr2tb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dxr2tb/archetype_of_the_circle_symbolism_in_film_art/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "ZvIbBr3NVXjtzRkUggGQImLPKSznASGJ7bzb5QIgLi8", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/u2Xr_I4XqEnd17ly3G9KEnaXHGSNG_hsqLsDhPGN320.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dee5894d9d78ab763a5c43954865b49490f2bb4", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/u2Xr_I4XqEnd17ly3G9KEnaXHGSNG_hsqLsDhPGN320.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d74ef637173a5c771f465630e9e06daaf273405", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/u2Xr_I4XqEnd17ly3G9KEnaXHGSNG_hsqLsDhPGN320.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbf3c8ed31f9be622049e20b91850b902ffe5546", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/u2Xr_I4XqEnd17ly3G9KEnaXHGSNG_hsqLsDhPGN320.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=e27f9a1ab79857485a983c8b49f68016fc7e1b7a", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1574018612, "score": 1, "selftext": "We explore the symbolism of the circle through Joseph Campbell's illustration of its spiritual significance on our souls, world and society. \n\n[https://youtu.be/5aQZfTgGPiM](https://youtu.be/5aQZfTgGPiM)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68656, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Archetype of the Circle - Symbolism in Film, Art &amp; Religion (2019)", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dxr2tb/archetype_of_the_circle_symbolism_in_film_art/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "CJ_Menna1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4qy4ta5g", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574017072, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dxqpdi/why_is_my_mom_seeing_spirits/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dxqpdi", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dxqpdi/why_is_my_mom_seeing_spirits/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574017074, "score": 1, "selftext": "This has been going on for a while now to where every time I see her she's asking me to please do something about these people\" ( spirits ) &amp; get them out of her house like they're flesh &amp; blood or something.

One who understands this truth about Me also does not become entangled in the fruitive reactions of work.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nAs there are constitutional laws in the material world stating that the king can do no wrong, or that the king is not subject to the state laws, similarly the Lord, although He is the creator of this material world, is not affected by the activities of the material world. He creates and remains aloof from the creation, whereas the living entities are entangled in the fruitive results of material activities because of their propensity for lording it over material resources. The proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right and wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves responsible. The living entities are engaged in their respective activities of sense gratification, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord. For advancement of sense gratification, the living entities are engaged in the work of this world, and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death. The Lord, being full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness. The heavenly demigods are only His engaged servants. The proprietor never desires the low-grade happiness such as the workers may desire. He is aloof from the material actions and reactions. For example, the rains are not responsible for different types of vegetation that appear on the earth, although without such rains there is no possibility of vegetative growth. Vedic sm\u1e5bti confirms this fact as follows:\n\nnimitta-m\u0101tram ev\u0101sau s\u1e5bjy\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 sarga-karma\u1e47i\n\npradh\u0101na-k\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b-bh\u016bt\u0101 yato vai s\u1e5bjya-\u015baktaya\u1e25.\n\nIn the material creations, the Lord is only the supreme cause. The immediate cause is material nature by which the cosmic manifestation is visible. The created beings are of many varieties, such as the demigods, human beings and lower animals, and all of them are subject to the reactions of their past good or bad activities. The Lord only gives them the proper facilities for such activities and the regulations of the modes of nature, but He is never responsible for their past and present activities. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras it is confirmed that the Lord is never partial to any living entity. The living entity is responsible for his own acts. The Lord only gives him facilities, through the agency of material nature, the external energy. Anyone who is fully conversant with all the intricacies of this law of karma, or fruitive activities, does not become affected by the results of his activities. In other words, the person who understands this transcendental nature of the Lord is an experienced man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and thus he is never subjected to the laws of karma. One who does not know the transcendental nature of the Lord and who thinks that the activities of the Lord are aimed at fruitive results, as are the activities of the ordinary living entities, certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive reaction. But one who knows the Supreme Truth is a liberated soul fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n**Question 1 : Why the Lord is not bound by the fruit of action while the living entities get entangled by it ? How the living entity can get free from this entanglement ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/dxjol1/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is414/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68555, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is--4.14", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dxjos0/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is414/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "IZ_Dave", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4xt5de83", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573974082, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dxjfx1/how_to_ground_and_why_its_important/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dxjfx1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Channeling"}], "link_flair_template_id": "fa02bd38-8418-11e7-839e-0ecd58f017ce", "link_flair_text": "Channeling", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 29, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dxjfx1/how_to_ground_and_why_its_important/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573974083, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey my name is David and I\u2019m a channel. I started a blog called Interview Zero where I share channeled info and I\u2019d love to share with you all here. I\u2019m trying to be mindful of the rules regarding self promotion so I\u2019ll post this post in it\u2019s entirety so you don\u2019t have to leave to get the content. I hope I\u2019m understanding the rules accurately AND I hope you find this info as helpful as I did! Here we go:\n\n...\n\nI want to start talking more about how we can learn to use our intuition, connect more clearly with our guides, raise our vibrational frequencies, explore, and much more but all these activities or practices won\u2019t get you far without learning how to ground your energy.\n \nBeing grounded is an important element for not only doing any intuitive work, but for living a healthy life on Earth. So today I want to share a channeling I did with Zero to help get more clarity on the subject. If you\u2019re looking for the basics to get you started, plus a little extra, look no further.\n \n(questions are me and Zero\u2019s answers follow in quotations. Hope you find this helpful!)\n \nWhat is grounding?\n \n\u201cGrounding is the action of becoming more aware of your connection to and creating an energetic balance between you and planet Earth.\n \nWhen you incarnate, you form a connection with the physical body and the Earth with what you might call your chakra system. (Hey, Dave interjecting here. If this is the first time hearing about the chakra system, I\u2019ve put a quick reference link HERE.) The \u201cRoot Chakra\u201d being the main point for grounding. Your physical body is connected to the Earth by being made of it\u2019s components and then moving forward, by the food, water, air, etc that person takes in throughout their life.\nWe want to note you are inherently connected to the Earth . On a broader scale you and the earth are vibrations of source energy. You are one. The act of \u201cgrounding\u201d as you call it is focusing on that connection and bringing that connection back into balance.\u201d\n \nWhy should we ground?\n \n\u201cBalancing your connection to the Earth has many energetic and physical benefits. When an individual\u2019s energy system is working in harmony, your body and mind are getting what they they need to work at their peak levels and are then able to handle physical and mental challenges more easily, even to promote healing and help to prevent illness or disease.\u201d\n \nWhat causes us to become ungrounded?\n \n\u201cAn imbalance in your energy field in the area of the root chakra. Many things may cause this but it would depend on the individual.\n \nThere are two causes we\u2019d like to call out at this time that may not be immediately obvious and worth your consideration.\n \nSpiritual path. During this time of transformation humanity is beginning to remember who they are and understand more about their capabilities. This is a wonderful time but extreme focus on the spiritual aspects of your life, while neglecting the terrestrial aspects of it may cause an imbalance. Treating these equally will not only stabilize your energy but will help you grow and expand your spiritual awareness and ability. \n \nBeing new. Some of you have only recently incarnated on Earth having spent lives elsewhere, maybe even be your first time there. This is a very interesting time for your planet and many have incarnated or are visiting to watch, aid, or participate during this transition. These people often have a strong connection to, or even memory of their last incarnation that continues to draw their focus. For some this is a deep connection which causes a longing for where they were before or even a resistance to being on Earth. This can have a drastic effect on your energy field. As the planet tries to feed you energetically and physically, you\u2019re creating a resistance to it. This can impact your well being. We\u2019d like to share that in addition to where you were previously, you\u2019re now also from Earth. Made from the Earth herself. It\u2019s time to embrace that fact and enjoy her support.\n \nAccepting this doesn\u2019t mean forsaking where you were before. You can maintain that connection while embracing your new one on Earth. The planet has much to give and during this time Earth will be there to support you unconditionally.\n \nThe focus on these sorts of things and others tend to activate your higher chakras and often leave your Root Chakra unattended. If done for too long it can cause an imbalance in your system and leave you feeling ungrounded. This actually impairs your ability to learn and explore these higher spiritual aspects, such as improving your intuition, communication with guides and your overall ability to raise your vibration. A balanced system allows your vibration to rise and for you to grow and explore while having the Earth support you in solid, stable ground.\n \nA connection to the planet Earth is a part of every being that incarnates there. Earth is unique to the universe. Sacred. Much like your mother, without her, you would not have the incredible opportunity to be there. The Earth gives you everything. Your food, your water, your breath, your shelter, the medicines you use, and your clothing. Even things you would label synthetic, have been created using elements from the Earth. We cannot understate how interconnected you are to your planet both physically and energetically. Remembering and appreciating this connection will not only help you grow but also be of large importance as humanity evolves.\u201d\n \nHow do you ground?\n \n\u201cThere are many methods to ground but here a few ways you may find effective:\n \nFood. Coming from the Earth itself, many natural foods have a grounding effect. At this moment, the more natural the source, the better the effect. Some foods however give you stronger results. Root vegetables, having spent more time in the Earth\u2019s energy field absorbing it\u2019s nutrients and minerals, are an excellent place to begin when feeling ungrounded. Begin adding a little more of these into your diet. You may find nuts will aid in grounding and also some meats carry this affect. Namely red meat.\n \nVisualization. Visualization can be a very effective way to create a balance in your energetic field. We will suggest one here to use but please keep in mind that if ours does not resonate with you, feel free to adjust accordingly, letting your intuition guide the way.\n \nStep one: Find a comfortable place to sit or lie down. It can be anywhere at all but you\u2019ll           want to be able to remain focused for a moment.\n \nStep two: Begin breathing in and out slowly. Breathe in for 4-6 seconds and out for 4-6 seconds. Focus you attention on your breathe. Do this for a few moments.\n \nStep three: Imagine or visualize that from your root chaka, tree like roots extend deep into the Earth, wrapping around rocks, moving through the soil, and digging deeper, as they reach and settle at the centre of the planet. Next imagine a beam of pure light extending from your crown chakra up and out, intense and unwavering, reaching to the very centre of the universe.\n \nStep four: Continue breathing but while inhaling, visualize the breath pulling up through the roots grounding energy from the centre of the earth, up through the rocks and soil, through your root chakra, and up into your solar plexus chakra. Hold that energy there for just a moment allowing it to spread throughout your body. Now on exhale, send some of that energy out through your crown chakra through the light beam, to the centre of the universe. Now we change direction. Inhale and visualize the breath pulling in elevating, high frequency energy through the beam of light from the heart of the universe down through your crown chakra and again into your solar plexus chakra. Hold that energy there for just a moment allowing that energy to spread throughout your body. Now on exhale, send some of that energy through your root chakra and deep into the Earth.\n \nStep 5. Repeat this breathing and visualization for as long as you feel is necessary. This can be done in bed, at work, before or after meditation\u2026 whenever you feel it\u2019s appropriate.\n \nGrounding Stones. Many natural elements from Earth have a grounding effect. Especially gemstones and rocks. They can often have the double effect of grounding you energetically and physically all at once. There are many that can do this but the following have a particularly good effect: Black Tourmaline, Hematite, Red Jasper, Shungite, Obsidian, and Tiger Eye.\n \nTouch. Physically touching a grounded object, a natural body of water, or the ground itself has an immediate physical/energetic grounding effect. Walking barefoot in the grass, placing your hands in soil, touching the leaf of an outdoor plant or tree, putting your hand in a river, lake or ocean. This must be done through skin contact or through a natural, conductive material. This is highly affective and almost instantaneous. There is also technologies you can use to help you ground while remaining indoors that use your electrical outlets.\u201d\n \nWhat\u2019s the most effective way to ground?\n \n\u201cThe most effective way to ground is up to the individual and their chosen path. To discover yours, we suggest following your intuition and trying the suggestions provided here and stick with one that feels good to you. If interested, your science can even test the physical connection to the planet at the moment. It\u2019s not fully able to test the energetic connection but some have been able to measure the effects of an energetic connection.\u201d\n \nDo you have to ground?\n \n\u201cYou do not have to do anything you do not wish to, ever.\u201d\n \nThat\u2019s a wrap. It may have run a bit long but I think it\u2019s an important topic. Learning how to ground has been a huge help to me personally so I hope you find value in this.\n \n~Dave", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68550, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How to Ground (and why it\u2019s important)", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dxjfx1/how_to_ground_and_why_its_important/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "newmoneygang0016", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_13wpvo", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573971926, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dxj5da/weird_meditation_experience/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dxj5da", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dxj5da/weird_meditation_experience/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573971927, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello everyone, I\u2019ve been meditating daily for about three months now and this last meditation experience was a little different.

Also had an ego death experience about 6 years ago and had to consciously rebuild my ego in order to function normally in society. \n\nMy beliefs are changing from \"life is hard\" to \"life happens for me\". \nThis morning I set the intention \"I want to attract people I enjoy being around\" focused my energy and brought up intense emotion and sent it out to the universe. I was at the cashier and ran out of money to pay, but I wasn't that short. So I tried to manifest in the moment, I found another dime in my pocket I swear wasn't there before. Again I thought, maybe I can manifest money. Brought up the intention, and when I got home my father gave me $10 for gas. \nToday at work (I'm popular but I'm still generally a quiet guy, been working on this for a while) there were so many people looking at me, wanting to be around me, and looking at me with awe being quite puzzled (this is my experience, although it's possible I hypnotised myself into believing everyone loves me, I understand how the mind works and have been changing my subconscious to believe this as well) \n\n\n\nToday at work (I'd like to say this to preface what I'm saying. I was under immense stress because my car had ran out of gas right outside of my job in the parking lot and I had gotten out to push it, but then realized I'd locked my keys in the car, everything turned out okay, but this caused me to be extremely anxious at work, and I had difficulty winding down after that) I continuously practiced lovingkindness for everyone there. I'd look at them, feel their frustration and breathe, consciously sending the intention that they be healed. My energy kept building and building, my body was vibrating with energy and I could feel the energy from my heart radiating to everyone around me. I began being able to intuitively understand people around me better. \nIt was difficult to be comfortable because so many people kept talking to me, I got overwhelmed. I'm having all these realizations in the moment, my body is vibrating with energy im practically losing my shit and people are talking to me at the same time. The energy in my body started to purify itself. I felt the hate and anger and all the negative emotions inside me being cleared away by this powerful energy. It was overwhelming. My body was almost numb afterwards, I could barely feel my hands or feet on the ground even though I was in pain from standing so much. I remember grasping my toes into my shoes thinking \"stay grounded\" \nI remember thinking \"be careful what you wish for\" because I'd wanted status and respect for a while but this was too much for me all at once. \nI no longer wanted or needed them to like me, and at the same time wanted them to be well. And I understand it was of my own making and understand how it works when you need nothing and only want to give, people are drawn to that. \n\nIt was too much for me. Now hours later I'm at home, and I had to sit in my car and take a nap for an hour, practically melting into my seat, doing physical relaxation in my muscles just to keep my feet on the ground in the physical world. I'm intuitively aware something is different.\nI feel less grounded, and my inner voice is almost silent right now. \n\n\nI'd like to add for the sake of helping people to understand, I've also been taking lithium orotate lately to even out my moods. I have ADHD very strongly and possibly bipolar. Used to be depressed but that's a thing of the past. Social anxiety used to be so strong I couldn't talk to a cashier without my heart racing. \nAlso I did take 15mg of CBD this morning. \n\nThis post may sound validation seeking, but really im wondering what in the F#$# is going on, if im losing my mind. \nHow do I possibly live at such a high vibration? I want to be able to function, and I'm aware of what great power I possess. And at the same time I understand where virtue comes into play. \nA few days ago I was very narcissistic and built my ego up so much. Which was good for a bit because I used to be lacking in self love. But then my mind told me \",you can't egoically identify with these benefits. They are of great power and must be treated with great respect.\" Then I understood that. So I learned about metta meditation and with that realization and practice I not only have love for myself but others. I'm less aggressive too. \n\n I spoke to a yoga teacher and told her I had such energy running through me it was difficult to control. She said to look into Thai chi. \n\nGuys help me, I know I'm just 23. But I've been practicing spiritually since I was a child. I intuitively used to meditate on the universe, the laws of reality, manifesting, even the anime I used to watch, or the samurai movies id watch when I was a kid I'd practice the same things they would like meditation and it felt like it was the right path for me.. even for a time when I was a teenager knew that if I practiced SR that women would be drawn to me. I've always understood that we are but characters playing our parts in the universe. When I was a child I was very vocal about this. People were shocked and astounded at my knowledge at an early age. \nNow today I'm thinking \"maybe this isn't my first life.\" When I come across knowledge that is true I feel it in my being and I think \"I already knew this\" \n\nHow can I possibly live and function like this.\nAlso a great thanks to everyone on their posts, many were inspiring and uplifting to me, and spoke to me on a masculine level. Even if I don't agree with absolutely everyone here I respect that everyone has their viewpoint and I'm very happy that people choose to express theirs, giving me a window into their beliefs and world. \n\nPlease, somebody who knows what is going on. What this all means. I need to find my true purpose.\n\nThere is so much more to say but I've already said so much. I know I'm not special, I can't be.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68542, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Kundalini, spiritual awakening at work?? semen retention, magnetism, purpose.

We will die every death possible, but we will not remember it, and thus not experience it. We dont remember dying because our mind/conciousness wipes the evidence. We're all life. Our mind wiping our death is a fundamental aspect of \"life\", almost like a defense mechanism sthat keeps us aware. That keeps us \"alive\" and \"experiencing\". Fear of death is what drives us forward. We're constantly living on the brink of death. At any and every point in the \"time\" that we perceive as events passing, we are about to die. Imagine the people killed in mass shooting or car accidents or any freak accident. Even due to old age or disease. You can be as assured as you want that you're  not about to die right now, and you're half right. You're not about to die in the fact that you will not remember your death and your mind will erase that death from your consciousness and just pick back up on an almost identical, yet slightly altered path that you will again experience that keeps you alive. Youre unawakened self has no idea that anything has been changed at all. You will just keep dying over and over and over again, yet your life is seemingly always normal because you will never remember dying. Life is all about finding the right paths, and it will eventually find the path that leads it to glory. We are life. We as humans are closer to the next dimension than any other path that life took. The end game for all life/species in this realm is to find eternity, the path to forever living, and thus advance into a higher realm. That is our goal in this dimension. All of life as a whole is helping itself along the way. You, dolphins, tigers, fuckin the most microscopic cell of life you can find. It is all integrated so delicately and intricately, and yet it is flawed.

A person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualifications of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be a s\u0101dhu. And du\u1e63k\u1e5btam applies to one who doesn't care for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Such miscreants, or du\u1e63k\u1e5btam, are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane education; whereas another person, who is one hundred percent engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is accepted as s\u0101dhu, even though such a person may neither be learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons R\u0101va\u1e47a and Ka\u1e41sa. The Lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord especially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demonic. The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin. Although Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was the son of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devak\u012b, the mother of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was the sister of Ka\u1e41sa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was to be born of them. So Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared primarily to deliver Devak\u012b, rather than kill Ka\u1e41sa, but both were performed simultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.\n\nIn the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja, the following verses summarize these principles of incarnation:\n\ns\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di-hetu yei m\u016brti prapa\u00f1ce avatare\n\nsei \u012b\u015bvara-m\u016brti 'avat\u0101ra' n\u0101ma dhare\n\nm\u0101y\u0101tita paravyome sav\u0101ra avasth\u0101na\n\nvi\u015bve 'avat\u0101ri' dhare 'avat\u0101ra' n\u0101ma.\n\n\"The avat\u0101ra, or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of God for material manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of Godhead who so descends is called an incarnation, or avat\u0101ra. Such incarnations are situated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God. When they descend to the material creation, they assume the name avat\u0101ra.\"\n\nThere are various kinds of avat\u0101ras, such as puru\u1e63\u0101vat\u0101ras, gu\u1e47\u0101vat\u0101ras, l\u012bl\u0101vat\u0101ras, \u015bakty\u0101ve\u015ba avat\u0101ras, manvantara-avat\u0101ras and yug\u0101vat\u0101ras-all appearing on schedule all over the universe. But Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the primeval Lord, the fountainhead of all avat\u0101ras. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends for the specific purposes of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious to see Him in His original V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a avat\u0101ra is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees.\n\nThe Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This indicates that He incarnates also in the age of Kali. As stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the incarnation in the age of Kali is Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who spread the worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement (congregational chanting of the holy names), and spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness throughout India. He predicted that this culture of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana would be broadcast all over the world, from town to town and village to village. Lord Caitanya as the incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead, is described secretly but not directly in the confidential parts of the revealed scriptures, such as the Upani\u1e63ads, Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Bh\u0101gavatam, etc. The devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are much attracted by the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement of Lord Caitanya. This avat\u0101ra of the Lord does not kill the miscreants, but delivers them by the causeless mercy of the Lord.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the symptoms of a s\u0101dhu (holyman) ? What is the main reason of Lord's appearance ?**\n\n**Question 2 : Who is the incarnation (avat\u0101ra) of Godhead for this kali-yuga ? How he is different from other avat\u0101ras ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/dx3ye0/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is48/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68406, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is--4.8", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dx3yni/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is48/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "noone619", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1io6tkp7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573890089, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dx3xb9/is_there_free_will_if_so_why_are_astrological_or/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dx3xb9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dx3xb9/is_there_free_will_if_so_why_are_astrological_or/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573890090, "score": 1, "selftext": "Often times I\u2019ll read personality charts, things or people who tell me about myself and my issues.

Long post. \n\nI used to be highly devoted to Christianity and made a point to seek ways to strengthen the balance between my mind, body, spirit, and mother Earth on a regular basis. I used to pray to God, read daily devotionals, meditate, do yoga, write, do my art, and take time to appreciate nature and thank God for all the beautiful flora and fauna of our planet every day. There's a radio channel in my region with Christian music that I liked to listen to on every solo car drive. I'm not a fan of the Christian music genre in general, but I found this particular channel's songs uplifting.\n \nI suffered from severe eating disorders along with a mood disorder and two anxiety disorders for several years and my spirituality really helped me to climb back up from my rock bottom. However, I got in an abusive relationship when I was in a particularly dark place in 2011-2012. \nThis person abused me physically, emotionally, spiritually, and sexually. He had some sort of sick girl fetish and used his (evangelical?) front as a so-called Christian to prey upon my vulnerabilities and insecurities, and to take advantage of my weak body. He would tell me that I didn't need my friends, only *him.* He would tell me that I didn't have any kind of disorders, that it was all just happening to me because I needed to \"put my faith in Jesus more.\" He made me feel weak and helpless through gaslighting, then love-bombing, coercion into unwanted kissing, touching, oral sex; occasionally pinning me down to dry hump me so hard I got large bruises. \nWhen he would drive me into empty parking lots to assault me in the backseat, there was always Christian music on the radio. I can no longer hear Christian music on the radio without feeling exposed and filthy all over again.

But this journey has led me to such a strange place, where seeing a mother walking and holding her toddler\u2019s hand makes me teary-eyed, where hearing a homeless person say \u201cgod bless you\u201d to passerbys just tugs at my heart. It all can just seem so beautiful. Why is there any kindness at all? Why is anyone ever compassionate? It doesn\u2019t have to be this way, yet people still choose to smile, to speak tenderly, to comfort the sorrowful. It\u2019s just beautiful, I can\u2019t help myself sometimes. Tears just come as soon as I shift to a certain perspective, gratitude. \n\nI have this deep feeling that the battle is already won. That goodness, one day, will consume us all, and every smile and act of love and compassion is pushing us closer. There are many reasons to despair, and be pessimistic. It\u2019s hard for me to even understand my own journey, having been nothing less than suicidal at several dark moments of my life. I didn\u2019t want to just die, I wanted it all to end, I thought we were just part of some cruel joke. I only felt suffering. \n\nHow far away that is now. What a terrible dream those years were. I see it now, the victory is already won. Love replicates itself, hatred only destroys. So if anything exists in the end, it will be love. If nothing exists, then there is no hatred either. \n\nI can never not think this way. I act selfishly still, but I can\u2019t go back now.

I need some help as I currently find myself in a confusing place. For my entire life I have been living within the realm of the mind. I have been completely unaware of my power as in infinite creator on this Earth. And now that I have come into understanding of this power in the past year and more so in the last two months I find myself at a point of transformation and transition. You see a few months ago I quit my job. This was one of the best decisions that I could have made for myself, mentally, physically and spiritually. It was an OK job by society\u2019s standards but it heavily damaged my soul and for the three years I worked there my life was in a very dark place. I have enjoyed the past few months and they have been the best time of my life so far. I have grown immensely in a short time. However my monetary funds are beginning to lessen and this has created an anxiety in me.\n\nMy true passion in life is the study of spirituality, ecology and human development and I am writing a book on the subject of Ecopsychology. However this is a huge endeavor and while I have made great progress on the book every cell in my body feels called to place all of my energy towards the completion and publication of my book. However when I look at my external reality I do indeed feel an air of anxiety when it comes to how I will do this. Every cell in my body is telling me to not go back to getting a traditional job. And yet over the last month there is one job offer that is continually appearing in my life and I have no desire to accept this job. I do wonder if this job offer continually appearing in my experience is a test of faith and or an external manifestation of my fear. Whenever I think of working this job I do not see light in my minds eye, only darkness and subsequent pain. I guess what I am trying to ask is, how do I know if something is truly for me or not for me if it keeps appearing in my life?\n\nI am very keen on making good decisions and am quite a decisive person so this level of confusion within me is unsettling. I am going to meditate on this as I have a feeling that my intuition is telling me to not regress back into old fear based ways of thinking and perceiving reality and thus that it would be in my best interest to follow the path I feel guided towards even though I cannot see the steps. I have never had this much faith before, this is new alien territory for me but I know that I cannot go back. Again the thing I am struggling with is the discerning whether the reoccurring job offer is a temptation, a test of faith to see if I will fall back to my old ways or if I will truly transcend my fears and go towards a new version of myself and access a new level of my life? All I know for certain right now is that I have to trust the process 100% even though I cannot see ahead and have a knowing that the universe has my best interests at hand and truly does want the best for my unfolding life in this realm.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68353, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Help needed in Trusting the Universe", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dwyrn7/help_needed_in_trusting_the_universe/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "spiritualmotivation1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4rj50t4b", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573859122, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dwyici/success_without_struggle_or_sacrifice_abraham/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dwyici", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dwyici/success_without_struggle_or_sacrifice_abraham/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "1ZD_ynu47qEqxfybAlHnFcT4Kl3q3svCO9ethZS5PE8", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hfMAh3wUsKVWa9yBtusvux7pwOaCbWpU1picURhd-F4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea032e2e3f3ef616eda27d3afdcb8e27347dd240", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hfMAh3wUsKVWa9yBtusvux7pwOaCbWpU1picURhd-F4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a465c302975f63f01f4be2fc11b7a34763ff5f8", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hfMAh3wUsKVWa9yBtusvux7pwOaCbWpU1picURhd-F4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe20d1206188b2804dcbe2ad5e218c381328ddf5", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hfMAh3wUsKVWa9yBtusvux7pwOaCbWpU1picURhd-F4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=674e79ddf128e96017cd4757e25e06cc392a9ef6", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1573859123, "score": 1, "selftext": "Abraham Hicks video on how to attain success without any struggle or sacrifice!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmIt4P3HR_s", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68354, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "SUCCESS WITHOUT STRUGGLE OR SACRIFICE - Abraham Hicks 2020 (Law of Attra...", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dwyici/success_without_struggle_or_sacrifice_abraham/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Shrugbeternowthaneva", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4vj8puem", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573858428, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dwycve/time_moves_differently_now/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dwycve", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dwycve/time_moves_differently_now/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573858430, "score": 1, "selftext": "It just occured to me that my descent into homelessness started over a year ago. I began keeping a journal that first night while waiting for my friend to pick me up from the gas station. It seems so long ago, and yet it feels like it all happened yesterday. I can recall moments and events that happened with perfect clarity, yet the more I dwell on it, the more I notice a distortion with my own perception of time.\n\nIt's difficult to describe, mainly because it's like trying to bite my own teeth. I've experienced a similar spatial distortion in my dreams. Places that are very familiar to me, like the house I grew up in, are very well put together, meaning they are often 1:1 with reality. On the other hand, places I have a cursory experience with will often be distorted, usually linking with other places based on memories I have involved with that area. For instance, a highway near my old house leads several states over in my dreams because I know it connects with the airport and my brain associates that highway with leading to the other state.\n\nThe memories of everything that have happened seems to be a similar level of mixed together. They are stretched where I'm in a similar place that I am now, and they seem like they have happened more recently. Meanwhile, my experience in local cities seems so distant, like it was before my descent into homelessness, because they are so different.\n\nThis leads to a weird \"now-ness\" I feel like time is moving so fast yet so slow at the same time. Days seem to take forever, but then I blink and it is a week later. I've stopped caring so much about the day. I just am. Perhaps it is this departure from a linear narrative that is making me more nebulous in terms of my perception of self across time. I don't care who I am anymore. I can be anyone (well, there are always limits, but I am orders of magnitude more flexible than I once was), and this gives me a different outlook of my past self from the differing vantage points.\n\nWho am I becoming? I look back and notice how different I am all the time. The fact that so much has happened to change me in just a year's time is astounding. How far have I objectively come? I wish someone had been there with me to tell me from their point of view who I have become.\n\nI am becoming no one. The ego is being eroded. I can adapt to my circumstance more readily now; I am more accepting of what life hands me. I am much more calm and I act rather than react. My emotions are under control, where before I was a tempest storm ready to unleash.\n\nThat's another big thing that has changed - my steady mood makes time stitch together differently. I'm not going from depressive episode to manic episode. I just am, existing within the boundaries of the human experience. I'm not catatonic lying around, nor and I rushing to make the impossible happen. I do as I do when I do it.\n\nI am free. When I die, whenever that is, I know I will return to the source from which I came. This peace of mind makes one more patient with life. It is enough for me to be who I am. What flaws I have are acceptable, because I know I am working on them. There is no pressure! There just is the adventure! I am free!

Just wanted to share a few tips that I find helpful in overcoming imposter syndrome.\n\nAnd if you've never heard of imposter syndrome, it's essentially when we constantly doubt our accomplishments and we feel that at any moment people are going to call us out as a fraud, despite all the evidence of our achievements.\n\nSo, for example someone who recently got a promotion at work, may feel they don\u2019t deserve the promotion and believe that everyone\u2019s going to find out that they aren\u2019t good enough for the position.\n\nOr\n\nA student may question if they are smart enough to pass an exam, even though they spent hours studying and normally make pretty good grades.\n\nSo, imposter syndrome is very very common. It can strike anywhere to anyone at anytime, and if you do have imposter syndrome, you are not alone!\n\nHere's 7 tips to help overcome imposter syndrome:\n\nI've made a video all about it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ga0JMKJOZA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr if you prefer reading:\n\n1. Create a Fact Folder \n\nAnd a fact folder is a place where you can store evidence of all of your achievements, so if you have an imposter strike you can refer back to the folder to keep your mind focused on the facts. Because it\u2019s kinda hard to argue the facts, right? So, this could be \n\n\u2022 Statements about the trials, the hardships, or hard work that have led to where you are today. \n\n\u2022 Compliments that people have given you, whether it\u2019s been in person or through messages. \n\n\u2022 Positive reviews if you own an online business. \n\n\u2022 Awards given or pictures of trophies. \n\nWhatever has been an achievement or success put it straight into the folder! And next to each piece of evidence, write HOW you were able to achieve that. When we define our \u201chow,\u201d it helps us identify the steps we took to achieve our success and it leaves less room for our imposter syndrome to discredit our accomplishments. So, instead of just writing down \u201cI was offered a promotion.\u201d Write \u201cI was offered a promotion, because I exceeded my targets over and over again, and I was doing tasks that were beyond what I initially agreed to do in my signed contract.\u201d\n\n2. Write Down Your Success Goals\n\nSo, when we complete a project or task that was successful, our imposter syndrome sometimes kicks in and we think \u201cYeah, that was ok, BUT I should have done better.\u201d So, when we understand and define what success looks like to us BEFORE going into a project or task, then it helps to prevent our minds from thinking we should have done better.\n\n3. Set Realistic Goals \n\nSetting goals is completely normal. But when we set unrealistic goals, then it\u2019s likely for us to completely avoid whatever it is we want to do, because we become overwhelmed before we even start. And if we attempt the unrealistic goal, then we\u2019re more likely to fail\u2026because again, it\u2019s unrealistic. Right? And that can lead to imposter feelings. So, whenever we\u2019ve got a massive goal we want to achieve, it\u2019s a good idea to take that BIG HUGE goal that\u2019s causing us intense pressure, and break it down into small, achievable steps that can be measured. For example, if you want to lose 20 lbs, don\u2019t give yourself the goal of losing 20 lbs in two weeks. A more realistic and achievable goal would be to lose a pound a week for 20 weeks.\n\n4. Own your Accomplishments\n\nA lot of times we can discredit ourselves with our achievements. We say \u201cIt was no big deal\u201d or \u201cI got very lucky\u201d or we completely give the credit to someone else when we had a MAJOR part in everything. So, it\u2019s important we be aware of the language we use with others and state the facts, because it reinforces our hard work. So, for example, if someone compliments us on something that took us a lot of time to do, let\u2019s simply say \u201cThank You. I put a lot of work into this\u201d instead of \u201cOh it was nothing.\u201d\n\n5. Have an Action Plan for Mistakes\n\nIt\u2019s easy for us to feel like a total imposter once we make a mistake. But mistakes are normal. Everyone makes them.. Every person you think is extremely successful. Yep, they\u2019ve made TONS of mistakes. No one is immune. And when we make that one mistake, what does our brain do? Oh..it looks at all the accomplishments and achievements we\u2019ve had and completely disregards that one mistake. NOPE. It focuses on that one mistake, despite all of our past success. BUT, when we understand mistakes are normal and part of our learning and development, then we\u2019re able to create an action plan for when they happen instead of dwelling on that one error. So, an example of an action plan could be: Make a list that has an equal amount of positives and negatives that happened during the event and write down any improvements that you want to make.\n\n6. Know Your Imposter Moments\n\nWhen do you tend to feel like an imposter? Is there a certain time of the day when it strikes? Does it happen when you\u2019re at work, when you\u2019re by yourself at home or when you\u2019re out around other people? It\u2019s important to be aware of when you experience imposter syndrome, so that you\u2019re able to prepare yourself. For example, if you usually have imposter syndrome in the middle of a work meeting, you can prepare your mindset before going into your next work meeting by doing one of the tips above like looking at the achievements in your fact folder.\n\n7. Feel the Feeling and Take Action Anyway\n\nA lot of times we feel pretty nervous or doubtful before diving into a big project or stepping into a new role. But it\u2019s important to remember that these feelings are normal. We all have those feelings, especially when it\u2019s something we haven\u2019t done before. So when we have a good opportunity in front of us that\u2019d we like to pursue and we feel like we\u2019re not good enough or feel like we\u2019re not ready, we should take action anyway. Because there\u2019s a reason this opportunity has appeared in your life. It didn\u2019t come out of the blue.

Nowadays, the idea of individuals being endlessly distracted by completely inane and trivial, at times almost completely pointless pursuits and past-times, is a very common occurrence and is almost seen as something normal.\n\nFor a very clear and lucid experience of this one need not go farther than oneself and their own escapism, but if you wish to see this in the world outside you (and you live in a country where technology is at least relatively abundant), simply go on a ride with your local bus or subway. What you will see is people completely engrossed in their smartphones, often times with their ear-plugs in, completely distracted and dissociated from the reality outside of them. People that wish to block themselves out from reality, from the present moment \u2013 and ultimately, from themselves.\n\n*On the macro level* of our society, distractions can often take the form of the mindless production and consumption of unnecessary goods, the advertising and entertainment industry at large, the media and its propaganda, as well as through blatant political distractions, including war and general conflict.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n#The Deeper Nature of Distraction\n\nBut let's look at an important issue here - what exactly is a distraction and what is it distracting you from? And how do I personally define it in terms of what I've written and the examples I've given?\n\nFundamentally, I would define a distraction as something that moves one away from what they truly desire, what their truest will and determination is - be that a will to create, to explore, to discover, to experience any aspect of our manifested world. Whatever distracts you to any great degree from your core desires and intentions and makes you wallow aimlessly in the shallows of life, is a distraction. It is a distraction ultimately from yourself, for who you are and what your will and intent are in this world are inseparable.\n\nOur society is thus largely a distraction from you knowing yourself and following the path that is derived from such self-understanding. Understanding yourself, knowing yourself, [accepting yourself unconditionally](https://embraceyourexperience.com/2016/07/unconditional-self-acceptance.html) all go hand in hand. But what also goes hand in hand with those concepts and contemplations is your ability to be internally fulfilled, happy, at peace. It is your ability to find meaning and purpose in this life and to live a life worth living. As Socrates said - \"The unexamined life is not worth living\". A life where you are endlessly distracted away from knowing yourself makes you endlessly tread the waters of superficiality, thus making you lose any form of depth. And only through depth will you find a sense of meaning, purpose, peace and fulfillment.\n\nOn the ultimate level, our world can so often be a distraction from realizing your deepest self, that aspect of you which is in unity with the rest of reality. Through knowing, accepting and understanding your current scope of identity, ranging from the body to the mind, you start treading down the rabbit-hole of self-realization. The more you understand yourself and embrace yourself on any level, the more you slowly discover that in a deeper sense, who you are is not only a manifestation of the personal, but also the impersonal and transcendent. Your sense of being an individual will remain, both on the worldly (ego) and transcendent (soul) level. Even the sense of your story and ego which are a part of you in the form based world will be there, yet you will understand now more deeply that who you are also that which is beyond, the All playing the game of being both One and Many simultaneously. This paradox of paradoxes cannot be explained well linguistically, neither is it fundamentally necessary to explain it through the intellect.\n\nOnce you come to a deeper understanding of yourself as multi-layered or something we could even call multi-dimensional, the game of the world will impact you less, while you will gain the insight and ability to create a more harmonious existence for you and all. None of this will come over-night, but the journey of self-discovery is always worth its effort.\n\nExplore yourself, come to know yourself, but also embrace your experience, who you are and trust yourself. Through this you will move ever deeper into yourself, as the surface levels of ego dissolve, leaving you with a deeper experience of yourself as an individual, as well as your unity with the all.\n\nLook within and understand yourself, then accept what you find, allow it so simply be as it is, allow yourself to be as you are. From understanding and accepting yourself, right thoughts will follow, coupled with right action. The kind that will lead you deeper to the freedom that you ultimately already are.\n\nMuch love.\n\n&gt; \u201cTry being alone, without any form of distraction, and you will see how quickly you want to get away from yourself and forget what you are. That is why this enormous structure of professional amusement \u2026 is so prominent a part of what we call civilization. If you observe, you will see that people the world over are becoming more and more distracted, increasingly sophisticated and worldly\u2026 Because we are inwardly empty, dull, mediocre, we use our relationships and our social reforms as a means of escaping ourselves.\u201d\n\n&gt; - Krishnamurti\n&gt; \n\n------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nThis has also been posted here:\n\n[Our Distracted Society and the Deeper Nature of Distraction Itself](https://embraceyourexperience.com/2019/11/our-distracted-society-and-the-deeper-nature-of-distraction-itself.html)\n\nMy site for the curious:\n\nwww.embraceyourexperience.com", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68326, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Our Distracted Society and the Deeper Nature of Distraction Itself", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dwvnu5/our_distracted_society_and_the_deeper_nature_of/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Hermit_Radio_podcast", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_48cpo2o8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573844965, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dwvc50/a_hermits_story_part_1/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dwvc50", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General"}], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dwvc50/a_hermits_story_part_1/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573844967, "score": 1, "selftext": "The things you are about to read are aspects and stories from my life put into a tale. My intent is to create content for others to be inspired by or just a good read. (Disclaimer) The reader does not need to believe anything because it is a story. However just because it is a story does not mean there is not truth in it, so please read to enjoy. \n\nJohn Freeman for most of his life was always curious about everything, what is the meaning of life, what is my purpose? The questions that seem to have no answer. \n\n9/11 would change everything for John, after school John joined the Army to serve his country and do his part to make the world a better place. When the time came for John to go to Afghanistan he went without hesitation, this would be the beginning of a strange and wonderful life that John would live. During John's tour of duty he would see many things, good and bad. This happens to be one of the bad things he saw, in the middle of the night an Afghan police check point near John's camp was under attack. It was dark, the only thing John's team could see was tracer rounds bouncing off the check point. By the time anyone could figure out what was going on the check point had called over the radio, \"we need help, we have just been attacked by the Taliban\". John and his team prepared the medical room, the team medic had just left for R and R, with no medic they would need to improvise. Headlights coming in from the distance coming closer and closer. Horrified at the sight of so many injured policemen, john jumped into action and started to work on the first injured Afghan. The injured policemen had multiple gun shot wounds to the chest, with little medical training John did his best to help treat the wounds. A night john would never forget, because it would haunt him in his dreams for many years to come. After many hours of treating wounded Afghans and getting them loaded on helicopters to get them to a hospital, John cleaned the blood, piss and puke from the floors. \n\n(2011-2012)\n\nBut it didn't end there, what John and his team would later find out is the police check point was attacked by fellow policemen not the Taliban. What had actually happened was the policemen running the check point were having a party where they were molesting children and drinking. Another patrol of policemen stopped to check in on the check point and found what they were doing and demanded they stop at once and go back to work. The check point did not stop the party and carried on, the patrol was not happy about this. To punish the check point the patrol set up a machine gun and opened fire into the check point and threw hand grenades inside of it. The survivors were the ones that came to John's camp. When John's team found this out needless to say it didn't make them feel to great about giving them medical aid. \n\n(2017)\n\nJohn was now finally out of the army, but his past still haunted him. When he looked in the mirror, he would see a ghost, a pale reflection of what used to be. For years he struggled with PTSD and desperately wanted to find some peace. He had tried just about everything, therapy, meds but nothing truly worked until he tried meditation. For ten minutes a day John would sit quietly and focus on calming down and being at peace. For once John was able to feel his anxiety come down, for once he had thoughts other than Afghanistan. John thought to himself what if I go longer than ten minutes? This time John sat in meditation for hours in the void of his mind, when all of this sudden a blue Goddess appeared and greeted him in his mind. The being said its name was Rakt'iba never even moving its mouth, with a kiss to Johns forehead in his minds eye Rakt'iba was gone. When John came out of that meditation his world would change forever in the best of ways.\n\nEnd part 1", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit":

went all in. There's nothing left. It was possibly my final battle. The issue is in the desire of winning, but knowing that I'm all in emotionally, the loss will lead to depression, and everything I worked fir over the last 15 months is gone.\n\nSo the correct self-preserving path would be to resist the urge to stoke the flames of ego's passion to win, swallow my pride, and accept a loss before the battle is decided or victor known. A full retreat with no plan to return to battle. Thus removing the risk of total devastation.\n\nI only came to this conclusion as I tallied my chances and realized that a decisive loss would break me. Then came the realization that the win would only feed my ego, and that ego grows hungrier every week. That's how I got in this position to begin with. If I win, my ego will strengthen.\n\nSelfishly, you could say, let the victor's ego take the win, and swallow my pride. Truthfully, the battle is done, i think. I unleashed every volley to my disposal, every ounce of strength I had, mustered every allie to my side, to the detriment of our relationships even, called in every last favor and ounce of good will. I utterly spent to the point of collapse yesterday, but I never looked at the result this morning. As the sun rose over the battlefield, I abandoned the survivors, if any were left, and cowardly routed.  \n\nMy thinking is that until I'm spiritually ready to neither rejoice the win or lament the loss, I have to think that not seeing the response is better even than winning. This is a very difficult decision because the fate of others that may still yet be fighting, do so alone, without me, and they won't even know what happened to me. In effect I left the battlefield to heal, but went AWOL.\n\nI know my chances, 1/6th win, 1/6th pyrrhic victory, 1/6th eventual pyrrhic victory with heavy casualties, 2/6th decisive loss with heavy casualties, 1/6th complete devistation.\n\nIf I do nothing more, i suffer only the penalty of 15 month's work and allies fostered in that time. Though with a pyrric victory, what would be left to show for it anyway. This was my white whale. \n\nMy higher self says, let him be.\n\nMy decision not to see the results is self preserving, but there is no outcome condition that will help me spiritually or emotionally. No one wins in war.\n\nWhat do I do? Am I a cowardly deserter?

It is explained thus in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 parama-guhya\u1e41 me yad-vij\u00f1\u0101na-samanvitam / sarahasya\u1e41 tad-a\u1e45ga\u1e41 ca g\u1e5bh\u0101na gadita\u1e41 may\u0101: \"The knowledge of the self and the Supreme Self is very confidential and mysterious, being veiled by m\u0101y\u0101, but such knowledge and specific realization can be understood if it is explained by the Lord Himself.\" Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 gives us that knowledge, specifically knowledge of the self. The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply meant to serve the Lord. This consciousness is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. So, from the very beginning of life one has to learn this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and thereby one may become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and act accordingly.\n\nLust is only the perverted reflection of the love of God which is natural for every living entity. But if one is educated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness from the very beginning, that natural love of God cannot deteriorate into lust. When love of God deteriorates into lust, it is very difficult to return to the normal condition. Nonetheless, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is so powerful that even a late beginner can become a lover of God by following the regulative principles of devotional service. So, from any stage of life, or from the time of understanding its urgency, one can begin regulating the senses in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, devotional service of the Lord, and turn the lust into love of Godhead-the highest perfectional stage of human life.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the difference between J\u00f1\u0101nam and Vij\u00f1\u0101nam ?**\n\n**Question 2 : What is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness ? How lust can be converted to love of God ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/dwod4w/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is341/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68284, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is--3.41", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dwodi5/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is341/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "nihilisticlogic", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_qxr2z", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573807959, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dwo2nn/are_spiritual_zeal_and_religious_zeal_a_bit/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dwo2nn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dwo2nn/are_spiritual_zeal_and_religious_zeal_a_bit/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573807960, "score": 1, "selftext": "Are spiritual zeal and religious zeal a bit similar?

Apologize for the dissertation length of this post but I need to explain the situation fully to avoid a hefty q&amp;a before finding (possible) answers.\n\n I've been experiencing a series of \"coincidences\" for many, many years now. I've tried looking online for answers, but it seems that everything is either contradictory or offers no valid explanation. I know I'm not the only person who experiences this type of reality and I'm looking for anyone who also sees what I see to discuss possible meaning, spiritual implications, or potential use.\n\nI see palindromes. I see them everywhere. Digital clocks read 3:33, or 12:21. License plates read 8668 ad infinitum. Every possible permutation of palindrome appears to me at specific times in my life. I've done some research on songle digit numbers and have discovered some similarities with the numbers (I call them 'pings') that I see.\n\n1 - Connection, being, wholeness\n2 - Decision, a choice (upcoming, recently made, or the consequences of that choice)\n3 - Situation, regarding yourself or another\n4 - Initiation, something new\n5 - Solution, an answer to a problem, also love (5th chakra)\n6 - Temptation, the shadow of bad intentions\n7 - Completion, (the Bible (not that I have any serious regard to it) frequently used this number when speaking of things finished, a project or an end)\n8 - Potential, infinite possibility\n9 - Question, perhaps a new direction or a puzzle that needs solved (only reason for this is that I couldn't really find much solid interpretation that was consistent, which led to more questions!)\n0 - Void, emptiness, blank, the barrier to be crossed\n\nThese numbers don't appear to me on their own but strung together in a series (called a 'ping'). For the past ten years or so they've appeared to me as warnings, premonitions, or reflections. It's getting to the point where they happen so often (on a crazy day, a couple dozen pings is normal) that I barely stop to interpret them and just go about my business.\n\nSay I see a 222. I feel that a choice will be need to be made soon. Then it happens. If it's a 2222, then it's a bigger choice. Same goes for all the other numbers: 444, something new, 4444 something new and more important. I've seen pings as long as 8+ digits, and crazy shit happens. For instance, on the day that me and my girlfriend first got together, had out first kiss, I must've seen no less than 2 dozen unique pings in the 10 hours leading up to that moment, inuding significant pings related to love.\n\nAnd it gets even more complicated when nesting occurs. Inner numbers that differ from the outer number reflect pings that involve complicated scenarios. Say I see a 232. I consider this to be a situation (for me, inner number 3), and a choice (not for me or made by me, outer number 2). Generally the inner number is me and the outer number is exterior matters out of my control.\n\n[Aside: literally just looked up at the clock, 1:31 \ud83d\ude35]\n\nIt's gotten to the point where I see them, but I don't know if the 'spiritual' significance that I've put into them actually has any meaning, or if they're taking me down a literal road to insanity lol. Hopefully it's not the latter, but I really feel lost. \n\nI realize that I sound fucking insane. I think it's pretty normal to see them occasionally, 11:11 and such. But on this scale, the amount of them I'm seeing feels like something greater, something different, and something that someone, somewhere, has the answer to.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68262, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Seeing numbers, all the time", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dwmvws/seeing_numbers_all_the_time/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "chelledoggo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4d65xat", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573798909, "crosspost_parent": "t3_dwmp2t", "crosspost_parent_list": [{"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "approved_at_utc": null, "approved_by": null, "archived": false, "author": "chelledoggo", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": "Normal", "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "438635f8-fb39-11e0-b28b-12313d192a33", "author_flair_text": "Spiritual, Bi/Demisexual", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4d65xat", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "banned_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "category": null, "clicked": false, "content_categories": null, "contest_mode": false, "created": 1573827631.0, "created_utc": 1573798831.0, "discussion_type": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.OpenChristian", "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "hidden": false, "hide_score": true, "id": "dwmp2t", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "likes": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": null, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": null, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media": null, "media_embed": {}, "media_only": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_dwmp2t", "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 2, "num_reports": null, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "permalink": "/r/OpenChristian/comments/dwmp2t/how_do_i_let_go_of_resentment/", "pinned": false, "pwls": null, "quarantine": false, "removal_reason": null, "removed_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "saved": false, "score": 1, "secure_media": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "This is something I'm probably going to cross-post in a couple of other subreddits, because I think this is something I've sort of struggled with for most of my life.\n\nI know for a fact it's wrong to hate.

Whenever I walk inside it feels denser and I become sad most of the time no matter how well I'm doing. I've gotten a little better at maintaining myself by braving through it but it's definitely still here. It's weighing me down. I feel noticeably better immediately after walking outside. My grandma is 96 and sick, my dad is getting older and possibly going insane but he's been gradually getting more and more negative and worrying more. There's lots of unconsciousness there.

I can feel energies by looking at someone or in their direction, I am very in tune with the energy inside my body. Lately I had a kriya causing me to bow my chest (puff it out) moderately strong, afterwards there was a very intense energy radiating from my solar plexus and heart chakra. \n\nI'm aware there's a lot of negativity I've been accumulating for the past few years, and I've only begun to purify it in the last few months through letting go of past trauma. But I'm unsure how to proceed. \n\nSometimes I notice myself going unconscious and getting very self absorbed and narcissistic, superior, being almost mean and after it happens i wonder why it happened. \n\nI'm a bit unsure what I'm asking for here. \nIm pretty sure my energy and chakras become unbalanced through semen retention, and there is a lot of energy rushing through my body often times. I want to let go of the negative energy and prevent myself from being affected. \n\nAlso I have Fibromyalgia, a TON of repressed rage and negative emotions I don't allow myself to express or feel. Not until lately. Sometimes when I meditate I'll just get so angry my body tenses up, or I'll shiver alot too. \n\n\nCan I use pure intention and awareness to do this? Maybe I can do specific chants? I'm unsure where to proceed, I've considered Ayahuasca.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68261, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "No-fap (semen retention) Kundalini awakening and unbalanced energy", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dwmk19/nofap_semen_retention_kundalini_awakening_and/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "erikaallyson", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_12xoft", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573794845, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dwm0yt/why_does_he_stare_at_my_rose_quartz/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dwm0yt", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dwm0yt/why_does_he_stare_at_my_rose_quartz/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573794845, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have this necklace and it is a rose quartz pendant when I was talking about it one day to my coworker he looked really interested and content with it and acted very warming to it every time he sees me he stares intensely at it.

It was a feeling of love and happiness and safety. It was a feeling of *relief*.\n\nIt literally felt like I had been struck by lightning and I immediately sat up in bed and started giggling, but I was also tearing up too.\nThe really strange thing though was that I suddenly felt like I had so much clarity. It\u2019s like life suddenly made sense and I remember having thoughts come into my mind that at the time, explained how the universe works stuff I can\u2019t even fully remember now\u2014it had something to do with electromagnetic energy and positive and negatively charged ions or something like that. Physics stuff. Things which I had never pondered before. It\u2019s like I was being fed information. \n\nAnd when all of this happened, I actually stopped masturbating and just got up and started pacing and felt like I could conquer the world. And this euphoria continued for the next several hours and I went about my day in pure bliss, feeling like I finally knew that there is a grand reason for why we\u2019re here and everything was going to be okay. \n\nBut as the day went on, this feeling just slowly faded until I was back to normal again.

Many of these questions were answered as I was learning about the densities of light.\n\nI want others to have an easier time accessing this information, so I put together an article directly quoting the sources I found, and also providing my understanding of the densities, each with a description, visual, conscious experience, lesson, and examples.\n\nFor me, **visualizing is the only way to understand.** We are so limited in our words, but in our imagination we can connect with and understand these concepts.\n\nI hope this helps others to understand, and helps people like me who want to share this information, but find it hard to discuss/teach in one sitting.\n\n**Please share this article with your friends through the following link, a friend link that lets anyone read for free!**\n\n[The 7 Densities of Light](https://medium.com/@aquariusacademy/evolving-a-universe-understanding-the-7-densities-of-light-12c88f5bc0ce?source=friends_link&amp;sk=2f8431171664addc9b3d3cfb32cbe42a)\n\n[https://medium.com/@aquariusacademy/evolving-a-universe-understanding-the-7-densities-of-light-12c88f5bc0ce?source=friends\\_link&amp;sk=2f8431171664addc9b3d3cfb32cbe42a](https://medium.com/@aquariusacademy/evolving-a-universe-understanding-the-7-densities-of-light-12c88f5bc0ce?source=friends_link&amp;sk=2f8431171664addc9b3d3cfb32cbe42a)\n\nNote: This is a 100% free link and I don't make money when you click it.
