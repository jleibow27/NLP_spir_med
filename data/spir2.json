The goal is to be one with the universe, and on the way there you usually dress up rather mundane things in spiritual language until you decide it's time to stop doing that. You are tired of the earthly complexities and long for the long term reuniting with your full spiritual nature at last. You are usually more or less disengaged with earthly activities, unless absolutely necessary, and devote your time to detailed knowledge of things that don't exist on this realm even when there is no visible ripple whatsoever, because such is that path. When you get really good at it you become serene, kind, friendly, helpful, relatively selfless, and, ironically, often very successful at earthly matters, because you can't help being loving, and people respond well to love.\n\nThe Shamanic Path\n\nThe [shamanic path](https://shaman.capo.casa) is a bit different because very similar exercises are used to the mystical path- meditation, visualization, astral projection- yet the goal has nothing mystical to it whatsoever. As a shaman, you simply are not interested in enlightenment- this world is here, and you chose to be incarnated, and you specialize in it, and you are here to find new ways to live in it and do things in it and be really effective- for the benefit of yourself and the people around you. So you might have a chat with the universe, because the universe knows what you need to get in shape and make more money so your family can go on vacation. When you get really, really good at it, you become serene, kind, friendly, helpful, relatively selfless, and, ironically, often very successful at transcending reality, because you can't help being loving, and the  universe responds well the love.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 50739, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Two Spiritual Paths", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565762605, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cpixvc/the_two_spiritual_paths/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "birdyroger", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_16wslt", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565636907, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cpgz5q/the_guru_is_everywhere/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cpgz5q", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cpgz5q/the_guru_is_everywhere/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565636909, "score": 1, "selftext": "# THE GURU IS EVERYWHERE\n\n## Bhau Kalchuri\n\n A wandering sanyasi, who was a recluse and an ascetic,  once showed up at Meherabad during this period. He had  heard of Meher Baba and wanted the Master's darshan.  He was dressed in an ochre-colored robe, with long matted  hair and a beard, and his whole body was smeared with  ashes.         \n\nMeher Baba asked him, \"Who are you? Where do you  come from and where are you going?\" The sanyasi, with  evident pride, listed all the places of pilgrimage he had  visited and said he had now come to Meherabad.             \n\nBaba asked, \"Now what?\"            \n\n\"I have come to have your darshan,\" the sanyasi said.           \n\n\"Then?\"              \n\n\"Go further and wander throughout Mount Abu.\"            \n\n\"Then?\"              \n\n\"I will proceed further and continue visiting holy places.\"            \n\n\"Then?\"              \n\n\"Then what! I will continue roaming as I have been doing.\"          \n\n\"For how long?\"                \n\n\"Until I find my Master. Once the Master's grace descends, I will be free!\"                \n\n\"When will that happen?\"                  \n\n\"Whenever it is destined.\"          \n\nMeher Baba said, \"Everyone is destined to realize God in  the end, but no one has any idea of it. Everyone goes his own way.\"              \n\n\"What are we to do then?\" pleaded the sanyasi.                  \n\n\"Become dedicated to a *guru*.\"          \n\n\"Such a One is not found or seen!\"             \n\n\"Your eyes are to blame! The *guru* is everywhere. He  is to be searched for and recognized.\"        \n\n\"I am ready to find him.\"         \n\n\"I will show you God, but would you do as I say?\"                   \n\nThe sanyasi said he was ready and Meher Baba directed  him to sit under a nearby tree. Baba told him to wait there  and said he would give him instructions after some time.  The sanyasi walked over to the tree and sat down.        \n\nBaba became occupied with supervising the labor work of  the mandali, during which some of the men were harshly  scolded. After half an hour, Baba sent Padri to bring the  sanyasi to him, but he was gone!           \n\nAfterward, in a serious manner, Meher Baba explained to  the mandali:           \n\nIt is easy to renounce the world by wearing an  ochre-colored robe, but to find a *guru* is very difficult.  Surrenderance at his feet is even more difficult, but the  most difficult of all is to carry out a *Guru's* orders.            \n\nTake that sanyasi for instance: for years he has lived  aloof like a recluse, he has been visiting places of  pilgrimage, undergoing hardships in the heat and cold. He  has also made innumerable pilgrimages and will go on  making them for years to come. But unless and until he  surrenders to a *guru*, he will gain nothing. He will go on  wandering with his face and body covered with ashes.             \n\nEven if he comes in contact with a real *guru*, he  understands nothing and flings away the cup which is very  near his lips! I told him to sit underneath a tree, which he  could not do for even half an hour! It is beyond one's  capacity to realize God except by the grace of a Master \u2014 and  it is not easy to gain that grace. It requires the  preparation of births and births to be worthy of it.  Therefore, those who are living in the intimate contact of  the Master are truly blessed.                   \n\nLater, describing a real lover of God, Meher Baba said:         \n\nAs a thirsty man under the scorching sun in the desert  values water more than pearls or diamonds, so also a real  lover of God only thirsts for Him and considers everything  else as dust before Him! A real lover is not after name,  fame or wealth. He only yearns for God, his Beloved. He  who does not possess this attribute is full of selfishness!            \n\n***LORD MEHER***, 1st USA ed, vol. 2, pp. 621-624          \n 1986 \u00a9 Avatar Meher Baba Perpetual Public Charitable

But there is no need to feel bad about that word. If you understood crazy you would not be in a psychotic fit about rather you would be elated and happy if you understood.  \nCrazy is not a description when used by most people. Rather a slur word. A hate word. A hate crime to be more specific but lets not do that.   \nEvery single person who says something contradicting your beliefs you can call crazy. And it literally drives them crazy.   \nCrazy has many meanings and we must understood all of them.  \nPsychiatrists call religion the mass psychosis of the world. If most of the world are crazy then why not join them?  \nEvery single religion calls it others followers crazy. So why be bothered by that word?  \nPsychiatrists themselves are seen to be crazy by the very same general populace that sends crazy people to them. Is that not enough evidence that the word is meaningless?  \nCelebrities are called crazy every single day of their lives. Does it bother them or do they not give a shit about other people's opinion? Donald Trump himself and every single world leader is called crazy every single day of their lives and yet it doesn't move a single hair of their bodies.  \nCrazy in the medical sense requires you to be causing damage to your life and impairing your well being and ability to function. If you are happy and satisfied in your life, then surely you are not crazy. If crazy is to be happy in the sad world. Then surely crazy beats normal. As a matter of fact Crazy is much better than normal. The joker was crazy and look how cool he is. The cool kids all get called crazy and it only makes them cooler. Every prophet of every major religion from Buddha to Jesus to Muhammed was called crazy by nearly everyone and yet look at their billions of followers. If they were crazy they would've been chained and tortured like most crazy people actually go through. But these people inspired empires and created massive systems of belief.  \nLet me tell you the truth about the word crazy.  \nCrazy is a hate word  \nCrazy is a slur  \nAnd it is only used when suddenly you rise above people. And so you get haters. And haters just hate you to bring you down.  \nEinstein was called crazy for his ideas  \nNewton was called crazy for his ideas  \nAlexander the Great was called crazy for his ideas  \nGalileo himself was called crazy and house arrested.  \n\n\nCrazy is scary for it is an unknown quantity. A card of randomness you can't expect. A crazy person walks to someone and he might either kiss them or stab them. And that person doesn't even have the slightest clue which action he will take. And that is so empowering. So scary to others that they must attack you for they fear you and they hate you for being stronger than them. Bullies are often not the Jocks, But bullies are mostly the losers bullying the successful.  \n\n\nNow we're all here spiritualists so lets throw the garbage that is psychiatry in the trash where it belongs.  \n\n\nNow that the path of spirituality and Kundalini Awakening causing actual psychosis in the way. Because the beliefs get shattered so fast it makes you question your reality and your preheld notions of how the world works. And thats ok. its merely part of the experience you must enjoy.  \nWhats so bad about hanging out with some cool crazy guys in a psych ward? People judging you?

Such nourishing foods are sweet, juicy, fattening and palatable. Foods that are too bitter, too sour, salty, pungent, dry and hot, are liked by people in the modes of passion. Such foods cause pain, distress, and disease. Food cooked more than three hours before being eaten, which is tasteless, stale, putrid, decomposed and unclean, is food liked by people in the mode of ignorance.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe purpose of food is to increase the duration of life, purify the mind and aid bodily strength. This is its only purpose. In the past, great authorities selected those foods that best aid health and increase life's duration, such as milk products, sugar, rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. These foods are very dear to those in the mode of goodness. Some other foods, such as baked corn and molasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant when mixed with milk or other foods. They are then in the mode of goodness. All these foods are pure by nature. They are quite distinct from untouchable things like meat and liquor. Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse, have no connection with animal fat obtained by slaughter. Animal fat is available in the form of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese and similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the killing of innocent creatures. It is only through brute mentality that this killing goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk. Slaughter is the way of subhumans. Protein is amply available through split peas, dhall, whole wheat, etc.\n\nFoods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or overly mixed with red pepper, cause misery by producing mucous in the stomach, leading to disease. Foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness are essentially those that are not fresh. Any food cooked more than three hours before it is eaten (except pras\u0101dam, food offered to the Lord) is considered to be in the mode of darkness. Because they are decomposing, such foods give a bad odor, which often attracts people in this mode but repulses those in the mode of goodness.\n\nRemnants of food may be eaten only when they are part of a meal that was first offered to the Supreme Lord or first eaten by saintly persons, especially the spiritual master. Otherwise the remnants of food are considered to be in the mode of darkness, and they increase infection or disease. Such foodstuffs, although very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness, are neither liked nor even touched by those in the mode of goodness. The best food is the remnant of what is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Supreme Lord says that He accepts preparations of vegetables, flour and milk when offered with devotion. Patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41 phala\u1e41 toyam. Of course, devotion and love are the chief things which the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts. But it is also mentioned that the pras\u0101dam should be prepared in a particular way. Any food prepared by the injunction of the scripture offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be taken even if prepared long, long ago, because such food is transcendental.

Long story short? Working my path sorta backwards from the seeming norm, and while I've awakened, enlightened, figured out my mission or what have you, I also am sure that one reason why \"what's next\" is not \"what's NOW\" already anywhere except inside my mind is because I have some letting go to do.\n\nNow, in human medical terms, I'm diagnosed with chronic and severe complex post traumatic stress disorder, thanks to multiple traumas, some of them happening multiple times, and \"trauma happening to me\" for a multitude of years.  \n\nSo I know that, for example, to put the bad pieces of a hard breakup in your past and actually close it off to stay fully left behind you, people might suggest to clear energy leftover from that trauma by i.e. writing a letter to the ex and then burning it. Or gathering all the objects that have the relationship energy and holding a ritual bonfire, etc etc.\n\nBut let's say you (I) cannot even fully remember Every. Single. Trauma I've ever sustained let alone take time/money/supplies/energy to do a clearing of negative shit ceremony for them all; what would y'all suggest as a way to wrap up the loose ends, energetically and or on a bodily level, if a. I want to honor it all having helped me grow yet wish to be fully done with it, and b. and some of these things are things like almost impossible to clear and fully forget??  A one time ceremonial letting go, regularly scheduled cleansing rituals, what?

On my own I know nothing, everything that I know today, and everything that I am, I owe to Jesus the Christ. I lived most of my life in darkness, suffering, alcoholism, drug abuse, violence, criminal, etc. My life was a playground, or battleground of demons, so called fallen angels, reptilians or archons, aka Demiurge, which sought to destroy me from within myself by possessing my body, and using my mind, body and actions, to harm both me and others through me, 19 years I shared body with this dark entity, which nearly brought me to my death or imprisonment... I wasn't aware back then that it was foreign dark influence in my body, nor did I remember any of those experienced where archon acted through my body, all until the day when I \"met\" God through Jesus Christ.   \n\n\nIn other words, after my humble prayers, and tireless persistent seeking &amp; praying to know the Truth and meaning of life, then one night when I was in deep sleep, Jesus came, spoke to me, and by the power of His voice, as He said \"rise\", same instant my soul obeyed, left the body and was raised to higher spiritual platform or dimension, or even heaven if you will...and here I was, in a place where everything was pure energy of Light, and the figure before me, whose physical appearance could not be seen, because out of His body, shone bright light of a 1000 suns, and this warmth of His Light, was the most powerful Light my soul ever felt.  \n\n\nNow, if I were to write everything that he told me, revealed me and taught me,  if I had to write it all down, then I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written, so to speak...99% percent of everything I don't even remember, it was out of body experience, my soul was educated while my body &amp; brain lay in bed, in something like suspended animation I suppose...But He told me not to worry for not remembering, that all He taught me I can remember and draw out of my heart-intuition so to speak, that through our heart&amp;intuition, we are all connected to the universal \"internet\", to our Higher Self, to God, and everything else that exists, in this world or the one above..  \n\n\nThat was 6 years ago, by today, I remembered just enough to be able to change the world, and guide everyone back home to heaven without needing to die. Everyone who can use his mind, is able to apply this knowledge to transcend His ego and embody His Higher Self, and finish this earthly school and Ascend into 5th Dimension of Love &amp; Light, to live in eternal life, without need to be born, grow, and die....again.  \n\n\nIf anyone is willing to listen, to believe me, trust me, and learn from me, I stand here in your service, for your personal growth and spiritual advancement. I am willing to share knowledge freely, you just have but to ask, I will benefit from teaching you as you from learning from me, because we are one, both teacher and learner, and what we give to others is what we receive, when one teachers - two learn.  \n\n\nBut, if you wish to help me financially I wont refuse, because my family has so much debts, we barely manage to pay the bills, and every few months get warning that they will cut off our electricity, all because some greedy fat ignorant people had decided to deceive greatly beloved humankind's gift - Nikola Tesla. Moresoever, I cant see my mother because she goes away from our country to earn money where salary is worth working for, so she's away from home nearly whole year...If you wish to help me, any kind of sum would be appreciated, and I would be grateful beyond measure.   \n\n\nMy Paypal email: [johnoflovelight@gmail.com](mailto:johnoflovelight@gmail.com)  \n\n\nIf any of you show interest to commit to learning from me, it will be enough for me to dedicate myself to you, and if you find what you are learning from me truly beneficial, helpful, and valuable, then feel free to donate some money based on how grateful you are and how helpful you find the info &amp; knowledge that you receive.  \n\n\nThis is first time after those 6 years that I ask for help, till now I shared freely with everyone, but 85% of the time, now I realize, was casting pearls before swine...I don't wish to do that anymore, so those that help me I will be sure that they are worthy of the treasures of my heart.  \n\n\nFact, truth, thought of the day;  \n\n\nTruth is One...  \nAll is One.

My spiritual journey has helped me to come to many realizations that have helped me view the world and my life in a much different way than I used to. \n\nMy spiritual journey began with a blissful \"glimpse\" that lasted about a year.  During this time i felt very connected and at peace in my life.  It felt as though i was within the flow of life.  My awareness increased during this time and i experienced many profound insights. \n\nOf course, nothing is permanent.  I came down from my blissful high and entered a stage that was more stable and consistent.  Over time, it feels as though my awareness has slowly decreased.  When I try to \"let go\" and accept life as it is, I feel as though I am unaware and simply living life on autopilot.  When I was in the blissful stage, letting go felt, well, more blissful\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \n\nTo combat this feeling of being on autopilot, I try to be mindful and focus on the moment.  I try to look around and take in my surroundings.  I try to truly listen to people and respond in a meaningful way.  Obviously I can't live like this all of the time, but I try to be mindful when I can.  However, it seems like my mind is really resisting when I try to focus on the present.  I feel as though my personality starts to become more bland, and my head and chest start to ache.  It feels as though I can hardly think straight.  It just doesn't feel right, but i can't tell if the pain is a result of ego backlash or if I'm actually pushing my mind too hard.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on all of this?  Do I simply need to let go and accept the fact that I am less aware?  Or is all of this discomfort from mindfulness an ego backlash?  I'm kind of stuck in the middle between letting go and trying harder if that makes sense.  I know deep down that I need to use a bit of each in my life rather than going hardline in one direction, but i was curious as to if anyone else has felt some confusion regarding mindfulness and accepting the moment as it is. \n\nI understand that this is something that I'm ultimately going to have to figure out for myself.

is, is moving away from nature. \nAll the fruits and vegetables you eat as a Vegan are man made, un natural. \n\nI was literally killing myself on a vegan diet. \n\nThe goverment is pushing veganism and I was so brainwashed I thought that they were pushing meat and dairy, but it\u2019s literally the opposite.\n\nVeganism is depopulation.\nIt\u2019s a control mechanism.\nYou will NEVER ascend as a Vegan. \nOur ancestors ate pretty much only animal products and it\u2019s honestly disrespectful to them to be a Vegan, they definitely do not want this. \n\nI know a lot of people are going to be angry at this post, being a Vegan makes you mentally ill \nand I have experienced it first hand, I was so delusional I would actually tell people that animal products are bad for you, when it is literally the opposite, you should not have ANY fruits or vegetables in your diet, because you do not eat wild fruits or vegetables which are natural and mostly toxic to humans, you eat man made fruits and vegetables, which is un natural. \n\nEverything you read about Veganism being the optimal diet is misinformation spread by the government. \n\nSo many babies have died due to Veganism recently and it\u2019s disgusting.\n\nQuestion everything and don\u2019t believe what you are told. \n\nYou can NOT thrive on a plant based diet, even though you might think you feel fine and full of energy (which I did) it\u2019s because your brain doesn\u2019t work properly as a Vegan. You\u2019re eating yourself (animal products). \n\nThere are serious health problems that come with a Vegan diet, luckily I started noticing them, a lot of people aren\u2019t so lucky. Their mental health and immune system deteriorated so much they can not even see that they are ill. \n\nLook back on history, the kings ate meat and the poor ate grains, fruits and vegetables, the kings were strong because of the diet, and the poor were weak and easily controlled, maintained and they stayed in their place. \n\nI just really hope this post can save some people who are currently killing themselves on a Vegan diet. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read \ud83d\udc4d", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 50510, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Veganism", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565755111, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cp3506/veganism/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "dopeypickle", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_yiji6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565561080, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cp34s5/dreaming_my_a_reality/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cp34s5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cp34s5/dreaming_my_a_reality/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565561086, "score": 1, "selftext": "For the past six months I have been seeing my life throughout my dreams and I can\u2019t explain it as of now.

I could really use some advice on what to do with moving forward with my life at the moment. My significant other (twin flame) and I recently got back from a road trip and will be staying with family for the next few months until we make some money back and get our business off the ground. \n\nI'm currently staying at my significant other's house with her mother. The vibe here is really nice, her mother is kind and jokes around a lot. I just REALLY don't like the physical space of the house. It's very dirty and dimly lit, every piece of furniture is uncomfortable or broken, she has dogs that pee in the house, and there is stuff everywhere. I just can't get physically comfortable in this house. \n\nI'm contemplating going back to my own parent's house but that has it's own downsides. The physical space is amazing, well lit, clean, spacious, open, airy, and in nature. The problem with this space is that my parents are absolute workaholics that live well outside of the present moment, and my mom has one of the biggest Egos out of anyone I've ever met. They both carry a lot of suffering but don't acknowledge it. Even though I might be able to find physical comfort in their home I'm not sure that I'll be able to avoid the projection of their fears and suffering. I also don't want to be around anyone that feels like they have any kind of personal power over me. I'm sensitive to any kind of negativity and even though the physical space is wonderful the vibe is not. \n\nCan anyone offer me advice?

Why unauthorized fasting or austerities are considered as insults to the Supreme Personality of Godhead ? What is the outcome of such fastings/austerities ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** \"There are persons who manufacture modes of austerity and penances which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions. For instance, fasting for some ulterior purpose, such as to promote a purely political end, is not mentioned in the scriptural directions. The scriptures recommend fasting for spiritual advancement, not for some political end or social purpose. Persons who take to such austerities are, according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, certainly demoniac. Their acts are against the scriptural injunction and are not beneficial for the people in general. Actually, they act out of pride, false ego, lust and attachment for material enjoyment. By such activities, not only are the combination of material elements of which the body is constructed disturbed, but also the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself living within the body. Such unauthorized fasting or austerities for some political end are certainly very disturbing to others. They are not mentioned in the Vedic literature. A demoniac person may think that he can force his enemy or other parties to comply with his desire by this method, but sometimes one dies by such fasting. These acts are not approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He says that those who engage in them are demons. Such demonstrations are insults to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they are enacted in disobedience to the Vedic scriptural injunctions. The word acetasa\u1e25 is significant in this connection-persons of normal mental condition must obey the scriptural injunctions. Those who are not in such a position neglect and disobey the scriptures and manufacture their own way of austerities and penances. One should always remember the ultimate end of the demoniac people, as described in the previous chapter. The Lord forces them to take birth in the womb of demoniac persons. Consequently they will live by demoniac principles life after life without knowing their relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\"\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 17.5-6, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/coxod6/qa\\_verse\\_no1756/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/coxod6/qa_verse_no1756/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 50424, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "QA : Verse no.17.5-6", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565752518, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/coxofx/qa_verse_no1756/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "unicornrainbow1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_pr50wnn", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565533645, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/coxcop/is_life_without_a_partner_possible_through/", "gildings": {}, "id": "coxcop", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/coxcop/is_life_without_a_partner_possible_through/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565533647, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hi guys!\n\nFor the record, I think (true) love can be a beautiful thing and I personally by no means lack any of it, but I sometimes imagine a hypotethical scenario where a person would completely exempt from a love life forever. \n\nWould such a thing be 'completely fine since it's matter of mindset at the end of the day' or would it simply go against human nature? \n\nPS I am very much a beginner in mindfulness so excuse my ignorance :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 50422, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is life without a partner possible through mindfulness?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565752366, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/coxcop/is_life_without_a_partner_possible_through/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "EC_Budzyy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_44iarzla", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565533253, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/coxa50/chakra_clearing/", "gildings": {}, "id": "coxa50", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/coxa50/chakra_clearing/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565533254, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hey guys so I\u2019ve been getting really interested in spirituality over the last year and becoming a better person.

You need to begin reconnecting or connecting with your higher self, guides, and the divine through meditation. Start learning more about the afterlife, that'll snap you into something you're probably not even thinkimg about.\n\n2. If you're depressed, you are too much in your MIND! Get out of your mind by doing something PHYSICAL frequently throughout the day.\n\n3. Know that you are NOT here for YOU, you are here for OTHERS. are you willing to sacrifice your pain to heal others.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 50394, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Tip for those who suffer from depression", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565750853, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cou642/tip_for_those_who_suffer_from_depression/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "usernamealrdytakn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kaud2l2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565506287, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cotnd0/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_177/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cotnd0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cotnd0/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_177/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565506287, "score": 1, "selftext": "***\\*Please write answers to the questions in comments\\****\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u0906\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u092a\u093f \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094b \u092d\u0935\u0924\u093f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u0903 |**\n\n**\u092f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u092a\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0925\u093e \u0926\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u0924\u0947\u0937\u093e\u0902 \u092d\u0947\u0926\u092e\u093f\u092e\u0902 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0943\u0923\u0941 || \u096d ||**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u0101h\u0101ras tv api sarvasya\n\ntri-vidho bhavati priya\u1e25\n\nyaj\u00f1as tapas tath\u0101 d\u0101na\u1e41\n\nte\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 bhedam ima\u1e41 \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SYNONYMS**\n\n\u0101h\u0101ra\u1e25\u2014eating; tu\u2014certainly; api\u2014also;sarvasya\u2014of everyone; trividha\u1e25\u2014three kinds; bhavati\u2014there are; priya\u1e25\u2014dear;yaj\u00f1a\u1e25\u2014sacrifice; tapa\u1e25\u2014austerity; tath\u0101\u2014also; d\u0101nam\u2014charity; te\u1e63\u0101m\u2014of them;bhedam\u2014differences; imam\u2014thus; \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u\u2014hear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**Even food of which all partake is of three kinds, according to the three modes of material nature.

They are not all conducted on the same level. Those who can understand analytically what kind of performances are in what modes of material nature are actually wise; those who consider all kinds of sacrifice or foods or charity to be the same cannot discriminate, and they are foolish. There are missionary workers who advocate that one can do whatever he likes and attain perfection. But these foolish guides are not acting according to the direction of the scripture. They are manufacturing ways and misleading the people in general.\n\n**Question 1 : Are all kind of sacrifices, austerities and charities conducted on the same level ? If not, how one can discriminate between them ?**\n\n**Related Verse :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/7](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/7)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 50386, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 17.7", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565750609, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cotnd0/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_177/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "scooty_hearts", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_12ud16a8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565501869, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cot28g/remember_your_power/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cot28g", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cot28g/remember_your_power/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "qFG_Dvmyz7lAs5mg8Q0BGsic-smNJmtewdE_gI-ckXM", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/9fOEaCeNufMU41jXR_BihAECsiYnTfS5R5qXnSR8khY.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41b94d7c4c05f11be0aee591bbd6b5b2bcbe2b79", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/9fOEaCeNufMU41jXR_BihAECsiYnTfS5R5qXnSR8khY.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=651ba5f673a0405ecea15641f51491715da55a51", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/9fOEaCeNufMU41jXR_BihAECsiYnTfS5R5qXnSR8khY.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b20dd4464830599e02ce7699e20f623b3bb92a8d", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/9fOEaCeNufMU41jXR_BihAECsiYnTfS5R5qXnSR8khY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=c6ac9d4659eabee9e10ff4ae5c490f451ea9026c", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1565501870, "score": 10, "selftext": "Sometimes I slip into my depression and I need reminders of my strength.

The physical which can be seen, smelled, touched, heard, and tasted.\n\nThe other plane of existence is the unseen which cannot be perceived by those senses. But it is real and everywhere the physical is. This is thoughts, feelings, emotions, memories, imaginal activity, etc.\n\nTogether they both make the present moment you are experiencing. It passes away. The now will die and a new now will come. That's what change is. Change is when old energies pass away and make room for new energies to come in. So, yes, the unseen realm changes too. This includes your soul, aura, mind, and whatever other non-physical things you believe in. They have a form, they just can't be perceived. So, the passing away of something is what defines it as changing, as opposed to unchanging.\n\nIn order for something changing to exist, something unchanging must exist that the changing will depend on / interact with. The changing does not need to exist for the unchanging to exist. But the unchanging does need to exist for the changing to exist. This unchanging thing is also experienced by us everyday.

Now I\u2019m not gonna go as far as call myself one, but I have been giving up many things on my journey.  Many things that were normal staples for me in my sleeping life but I feel like I\u2019ve awakened.  I\u2019ve given up meat, dairy and have been drinking tons of distilled water, and I  feel great as a result.  I\u2019ve fasted only a handful of times.  Man that takes a level of disciple I strive for on the regular!  My longest fast was just 4 days and was my 5th attempt to get to a 3 day fast.  I do however intermittent fasting nearly every day.  Next water fast tho I will want to make it a week long.   The focus you get on a fast is unparalleled.  It forces you to deal with your issues.  Any trauma?  No comfort foods baby!  Face your shit head on!  Kinda scary honestly but I don\u2019t wanna judge people because of trauma in my psyche, I don\u2019t want to resist the natural flow of life because it didn\u2019t go \u2018my way\u2019 I wanna be as in tuned with life and myself as possible.  Stopped watching porn.  Mostly lol in my low spells I may engage but has only been twice this year.  I meditate daily.  Practice energy work and breathing techniques.  I feel like I was a monk in a past life and I\u2019m reliving it presently in the city.  Far from the quiet life in the mountains tho but I\u2019m definitely trying to awaken my true self.  I read a lot about Taoism and I\u2019m trying to return to a much simpler more pure way of life.  I don\u2019t drink and I\u2019ve even stopped smoking bud for two weeks now after about two decades.  Yikes.  Feeling more clear headed.  Remembering my dreams almost every night.  I have fluoride filters on my sink and shower head and am aiming to eat only what grows from the earth.   Still a ways to go lol but in the process of transitioning to an alkaline diet and I live very honestly.  I\u2019m honest with myself and as honest as I can be with everybody in my life.  I always know when somebody isn\u2019t being genuine.  It\u2019s their energy, ya know?  It\u2019s mostly because I\u2019m on a journey of healing and many others may not be ready for their own self exploration.  In healing I\u2019ve opened my heart way up and I see an endless ocean of people who live in their head and have built so many walls around their own heart penetrating seems nearly impossible in this lifetime.

I try and visit it often to mediate near it, ask if I can use something near it for my altar, and do rituals and spells before it. Our dog was also w/ us on the walk. \n\nI went, but a towel down in front, sat, mediated, grabbed an acorn, touched my hand to the tree, I do actually hug it as well, and tried to arrive w/ the same joy I had from the shore and pass it on to my area. I put my phone light on and walked around the tree barefoot. (I just wanted to make sure I didn\u2019t step on glass.)\n\nThe next day my bf comes back from walking our dog in the woods and he sees H needles everywhere about 6 inches from the tree. We saw a white blanket there last night, but nothing near it. This morning there were a lot of needles on it and around that blanket. \n\nIt just makes me feel even more for what nature endures. It also brings me great pain bc my brother is in jail for a few DUI\u2019s bc of driving while high on Heroin and his gf just got off of subs so she\u2019s newly clean or...for now as far as we know.

I've achieved a highly developed awareness by prolonged meditation and psychedelic plants, especially Ayahuasca. \n \nThe strange substance in that Sacred Brew is called the Spirit Molecule. Along with harmala alkaloids, it gives you a temporarily open third eye along with typical tryptamine-like psychedelic effects, somewhat resembling those of mushrooms the most maybe. Nevertheless, this Brew enables many psychic powers, like telepathy, limitless empathy, complete awareness expansion, communication with entities, etc. \n \nI got one clear and obvious message from what I call \"ECCO\", the Earth Coincidence Control Office, much like what Dr. John Lilly wrote about. They gave me countless \"randoms\" and signs over the years and continue to do so. I started communicating with them through meditation and Ayahuasca regularly. They are the guys that God decided to put in charge of Planet Earth's well being on a long run, they're in a dimension \"above ours\", what I sometimes call the Next Level. \n \nI lately had a deep meditation session and an entity, an agent of ECCO broke through my spiritual energy field and started imputting information into my mind telepathically. I just heard the words \"Tell every human to enjoy their last few remaining years on this poor, poor tortured Planet\".

I was 10 days into a 40 day whole self cleanse. I had a  clean diet, practiced absolute silence, wore white and had very disciplined way of living and being during that time. Just wanted to share the memory. \n\nI've had fever for the last two days. An infection in my lungs. My sister brought me a Z Pak yesterday and my fever finally broke around midnight.  I'm prone to high fevers. My fever got up to 104.3 this time. Fever dreams are never fun though they seem particularly torturous this time around. What's interesting to me is how angry I am at how \"unfair\" it is with everything I have going on, all that I'm doing, that I would also have to deal with physical illness. I mean, I can't breath. I'm ashamed that I'm angry and I wonder when I will be able to accept what is with grace. Then I look at my boy. He brings me tea &amp; water, kisses my forehead. he's caring for himself and me. He does it with grace and compassion. No complaint. and my shame deepens. I keep telling myself  \"this too shall pass\".\n\nI am falling apart, but that is good, right? Broken to be rebuilt? I did not really come to terms with how painful this would be before I started, which is probably good because I may not have done it.  I did talk about the physical fasts ( food (sugar, wheat, dairy, solids), herb, alcohol, caffeine, speech, etc.) being difficult. I acknowledged that, but blessedly did not look at why :).  It was the point really. I've given up all my vices and am alone with my ego, un-dulled thoughts, and demons. They are so loud. So so loud. I was completely focused on the goal of purification and trusted Spirit to take me there as my heart and intention were unified. and so it is. this is a dark night, but the sun will rise and i will stand in it's radiant light.\n\nWhere ever I look in this world for comfort, I find none. My attachments are repeatedly shown to be false. one by one. dismantled. broken down. such a painful process, but suffering only comes when I attach a story to the pain. I am learning (slowly) to be with the hurt. to feel it. really feel it. as I do, i am noticing space around the pain. In that space there is a peace and that peace comes into the places of perceived loss like a healing balm. not the numbing band-aids I have grown accustomed to. not a blocking or denial. not the distractions of sensory pleasure. but real healing. I see this, yet i am not yet able to do this with consistency. I still have so much attachment to my \"buts\", to my silly stories.\n\nI know this is all part of it, but it is not fun. People are telling me I'm amazing and thanking me for my gift to the world (whatever that means), but I feel like a fraud. I can't stop crying.

I am not this crying, I am not this emotion. I am only experiencing it, I AM NOT it.\u201d Holy fuck I felt this in every inch of my being. It resonated so much.\n\nThen, still laying with my eyes closed, I started to begin seeing a bright, flickering violet light. Pulsating, so, so bright. I became much more emotional than I already was, realizing that \u2018they\u2019 were opening or working on my third eye. (I had an experience like this one time before, during an Ayahuasca ceremony. I was then told by \u2018they\u2019 that they were working on my third eye.)\nThis realization hit me so hard. I again now felt soooooo much energy flowing though my body. My head was pulsating, my arms tingelly, I was literally GASPING for air. I was on the bridge of hyperventilating. I was crying so much, I was SO grateful and it was incredibly overwhelming. And then again, the realization came to me that again my Soul is processing through me.\nThe whole experience felt like the \u2018processes\u2019 I recognize from ayahuasca and psilocybin. \nIt felt like something was taking over me. It was something out of my control or imagination.\n\nAfter the experience subsided I was scared of opening my eyes, fearing the world would be different. It looked the same, but I felt a throbbing headache coming up. Also something i recognized from ayahuasca. And exhaustion. Complete exhaustion.\nI felt like I am being told by \u2018they\u2019 that this was a Kundalini awakening.

How a person situated on the transcendental platform different from them ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** \"Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the demigods. The demigods include Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva and others such as Indra, Candra and the sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness worship a particular demigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are in the mode of passion worship the demons. We recall that during the Second World War, a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market. Similarly, those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a powerful man to be God. They think that anyone can be worshiped as God and that the same results will be obtained.  \nNow, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion worship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in darkness, worship dead spirits. Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some dead man. Sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness. Similarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have seen that in India the lower class people sometimes go to the forest, and if they have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree and offer sacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship. God worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is said, sattva\u1e41 vi\u015buddham v\u0101sudeva-\u015babditam. \"When a man is situated in pure goodness, he worships V\u0101sudeva.\" The purport is that those who are completely purified of the material modes of nature and who are transcendentally situated can worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\"  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 17.4, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/7/19](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/7/19)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 50261, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "QA : Verse no.17.4", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565745404, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/coisuf/qa_verse_no174/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "squabbleviews", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4bcosft9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565446661, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/coil7p/monument_to_nonexistence/", "gildings": {}, "id": "coil7p", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/coil7p/monument_to_nonexistence/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565446663, "score": 1, "selftext": "Come with me friend, Journey to a place time meets its end, Dematerialize through the veil of lies shrouded in mystery, Pairs of wicked eyes synthesized super imposed on reality, Blink once your gone, Forever long, Time will cease to be.

For instance, fasting for some ulterior purpose, such as to promote a purely political end, is not mentioned in the scriptural directions. The scriptures recommend fasting for spiritual advancement, not for some political end or social purpose. Persons who take to such austerities are, according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, certainly demoniac. Their acts are against the scriptural injunction and are not beneficial for the people in general. Actually, they act out of pride, false ego, lust and attachment for material enjoyment. By such activities, not only are the combination of material elements of which the body is constructed disturbed, but also the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself living within the body. Such unauthorized fasting or austerities for some political end are certainly very disturbing to others. They are not mentioned in the Vedic literature. A demoniac person may think that he can force his enemy or other parties to comply with his desire by this method, but sometimes one dies by such fasting. These acts are not approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He says that those who engage in them are demons. Such demonstrations are insults to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they are enacted in disobedience to the Vedic scriptural injunctions. The word acetasa\u1e25 is significant in this connection-persons of normal mental condition must obey the scriptural injunctions. Those who are not in such a position neglect and disobey the scriptures and manufacture their own way of austerities and penances. One should always remember the ultimate end of the demoniac people, as described in the previous chapter. The Lord forces them to take birth in the womb of demoniac persons. Consequently they will live by demoniac principles life after life without knowing their relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If, however, such persons are fortunate enough to be guided by a spiritual master who can direct them to the path of Vedic wisdom, they can get out of this entanglement and ultimately achieve the supreme goal.\n\n**Question 1 : What example of unauthorized austerities is given in the verse ? Why unauthorized fasting or austerities are considered as insults to the Supreme Personality of Godhead ?

I'm also quite confused as to what happened to me so I needed to share the whole story. \n\nSeveral weeks ago I started experiencing many synchronicities. I also felt an indescribable spiritual energy enter my life (not happy or sad, just intense). It was mid week, and my friends were having their annual get together that Friday and Saturday night. Although this event was something I cherished, i knew I could not attend. I was crippled with social anxiety. It was hard to talk to my family comfortably, never mind attend a big event.\n\nThe night before the event, I discovered a YouTube video by Noah Elkrief. Noah was a spiritual guide and video creator who lost his ego when he was in his mid twenties. After disappearing from YouTube for about 5 years unexpectedly, Noah returned. Unlike before, Noah seemed a bit shaken up. Something was different about his energy. He went on to tell about how one day a little girl who he was helping looked him dead in the eyes and told him that she hated herself. Noah felt like his world was shattered, and this deep emotional pain filled his insides.\n\nOn his way home, Noah's pain would not go away. He tried to suppress it. As someone enlightened, Noah could not trace a single thought to this emotion. He was confused. Finally, he realized that he was trying to put a lid on this emotions, and so he took the lid off. Suddenly, everything changed. All of the suppressed emotions that had been stuck inside Noah's body rose to the surface. He went into a deep sobbing. Later he would describe the experience as \"cracking open - something very painful but also extremely beautiful.\" Noah realized that the mind isn't the only cause for pain. Emotions also get trapped inside us from the past, and they stay there until we release them. This must have been the source of this pain Noah had experienced.\n\nNoah began tracing these emotions back in time. At first he would discover painful events that happened as a child. Once releasing these emotions, he would travel further back in time. Eventually he got down to infancy. And when all these traumas were cleared up, Noah began experiencing past lives. He found himself in a war, terrified and confused. For the next year and a half, Noah would live in and out of past lives, experiencing the traumas that shaped who he was today. Noah eventually considered the idea that he was everybody in history - that is, we are all the same person.\n\nWhen I finished watching this video, something changed inside me. The best I can describe it is this great trust in the Universe. I suddenly felt great compassion for others. My social anxiety decreased significantly. I judged myself far less and allowed my emotions and insecurities to be where they are without shame. When my friend's party arrived, I decided to go. Although still quite socially anxious, there was something inside me that was okay with it. During the weekend, I would meet many new faces. One in particular stood out to me, as she gave me a book. It was a book called \"Many lives, many masters,\" a book about reincarnation.\n\nAbout a week after the event (last night), the time felt right to start reading this book. I dove in. Although I've never been much of a reader, I couldn't stop myself. The book was too good. It talked about a psychotherapist and how a patient he was helping through hypnosis recalled dozens of past lives. She contacted \"masters\" aka highly advanced souls, who relayed messages. Many of these messages included what we were supposed to do in this life - our purposes. She told the psychotherapist at one point \"this is for you, not for me.\" And perhaps its purpose was for this book to be written.\n\nSimilar to after watching Noah's video, I felt a deep peace inside me. Something felt trust for the Universe. I felt compassionate, self loving and without the urge for superficiality. I felt an intensified sense of purpose. I feared death less. Around page 91, something told me it was time to stop reading. I went upstairs, made some food, then got ready for bed. As I was brushing my teeth, something told me I needed to meditate. About three days prior, I had made the commitment to meditate everyday. So I sat on my cushion and I began meditating.\n\nAt first I simply focused on clearing my mind. When all the thoughts were gone, I asked God \"Please show me what I have to do because I do not know.\" I continued repeating this message. Suddenly, I felt pulled into observance of who I was. I remembered many spiritual masters pointing to the question of \"who am I\" in order to achieve enlightenment. So I tried to discover who I was, openly and genuinely. After a few moments, I gave up. Then I asked God once more \"Please show me what I have to do because I do not know.\" Each time I would ask this question, I would be pulled into a deep inquiry of my essential nature. Finally I realized that who I am could not be seen. I am nothing but awareness. And that is when I began contemplating the argument that we are everything, not just awareness trapped inside this body. I stared at a pair of shoes. I asked \"Am I separate from you?\" I slowly began to feel as if I was everything - that is, myself as awareness was not part of this world, and so all that truly exists is this world - non-duality.\n\nI continued inquiry, but I kept coming back to a sense of individuality. So eventually I gave up. I stood up and walked around the room for a minute. I went to the bathroom. When I returned to the room, I saw a dead beetle on a floor mat on the ground, so I decided to get on my hands and knees and observe it. Suddenly I felt myself in a praying position, similar to muslims when they are worshiping. I prayed to God. Suddenly, I felt this intense love for him - a great respect for him. I felt like his servant, but at the same time fully worthy of love.\n\nI stayed like this for a while, praying to him. Loving him. Abiding in his sense of peace. Although in the past, my prayers typically consisted of me asking God for his help, this time it was different. I wanted God to help others. First I prayed for my mother. Something inside told me that she was okay, and that the pain I thought she felt was actually my pain, so I could let it go. I moved on to my father. I could not get through to him - that is, I could not feel this connection that allowed me to truly pray for him in a state of deep empathy. Then I moved onto my brother. Suddenly I broke down crying. I felt the pain he felt his whole life. I felt the shame of not being there for him enough. I felt so many emotions. I begged God to help him. Next, I prayed for my ex girlfriend. Only this time, my prayer only consisted of me apologizing for the pain I've caused her. Again, I broke down into a deep cry. Interestingly, perhaps the deepest cry I experienced was when I prayed for the dead beetle in front of me. I felt his pain. I noticed he was missing one leg and assumed he probably died from starvation (not being able to move). It felt a bit as if God was in that beetle.\n\nEach time I finished praying for someone, I was pulled out in a state of intense presence until the urge to continue prayer arose in me. I was in a deep state of intuition, following it for I had no other guide. When the experience was over, I stood up. My face covered with tears, I felt lighter. I felt like I had conquered my demons. I finally understood what vices were, and how crucial love and forgiveness were. I saw these blocks in my life, such as the block had felt towards my brother for so long, as far more important that I had realized.\n\nI paced around the room. Realizing I was thirsty, I walked upstairs to get a drink. It was around 2:30 a.m. and my brother was awake lying on the couch. He looked at me as I walked by. I wondered if he had heard me crying. As I was filling up my water, this intense urge to tell him I loved him arose within me. Keep in mind, as a 25 year old guy, saying this to my 22 year old brother was not \"normal\" - especially with so much deep emotion behind it. I walked towards him as if drawn by a magnetic force. I began crying. I leaned over and hugged him, telling him I loved him and I just wanted him to know. It felt like a weight had been lifted off my heart. A bit confused, he asked me what was going on. I told him that it had been something I had wanted to say for a while. He said \"you don't have to say that out loud, I know\" in an equally loving way. I told him goodnight and went back to my room. This is when everything changed.\n\nI stood in my room for a bit, contemplating what had happened. Suddenly, an intense feeling of shame arose in me. I felt heavily embarrassed for what I had just done. I worried about having to see my brother the next day after this happened. I laid on my bed, curled up in a ball. An intense fear arose in me. I felt as if a negative spiritual energy had entered me room. Though the urge to pray to God entered my mind, I no longer felt the connection to him. Something had changed. The fear intensified. I tried my best to allow the emotions, but they were too overwhelming. So I repressed them. I couldn't remain open enough to allow them in. (For the past ten years I had felt these negative energies off an on, usually late at night when I was tired which could well just be my brain playing tricks on me).\n\nI turned the light off and laid on the pillow. My phone was dead and my laptop was across the room, so I had no light. I felt so vulnerable. Again, I decided to let the fear in, but it was too unbearable. Ideas of being dragged across the room by some demon entered my mind. For a moment I believed it was possible. Again, I repressed these feelings in order to block them out - but more importantly, I felt I needed to repress these thoughts in emotions in order to actually prevent being dragged out of my bed or something bad happening to me by this energy. A while later, I fell asleep terrified.\n\nThroughout the night, I hardly slept. I woke up at one point in the pitch black, once more terrified. I had to force myself to fall back asleep. When I finally awoke, it was the afternoon on the next day (today). I contemplated what had just happened. I grabbed my laptop and began typing this. And now as I write the last line, I'm very confused about what happened - not so much in the beginning, but in the end. Why did my night suddenly turn upside down? Why did this fear overcome me? Why did it feel like God had left me? Did I do something wrong? I feel this guilt, but I don't really know why. That's the craziest part. I just feel this intense shame for no apparent reason. I feel shameful even writing this.\n\nIf you made it this far, you're a trooper. I hope you found what I wrote useful to your own life, and I hope you have some insights into how I can better use this experience and understand this negative force that suddenly came in.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 50094, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can someone please explain what happened to be last night (God-like experience)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565739193, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/co5vzc/can_someone_please_explain_what_happened_to_be/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Primrosedoll88", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2vfy2r8x", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565364007, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/co3t10/i_became_so_aware_of_myself_i_thought_someone_was/", "gildings": {}, "id": "co3t10", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/co3t10/i_became_so_aware_of_myself_i_thought_someone_was/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565364008, "score": 1, "selftext": "Trust me to be so weird.

the demons; and those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and spirits.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nIn this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead describes different kinds of worshipers according to their external activities. According to scriptural injunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those who are not very conversant with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions worship different objects, according to their specific situations in the modes of material nature. Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the demigods. The demigods include Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva and others such as Indra, Candra and the sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness worship a particular demigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are in the mode of passion worship the demons. We recall that during the Second World War, a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market. Similarly, those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a powerful man to be God. They think that anyone can be worshiped as God and that the same results will be obtained.\n\nNow, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion worship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in darkness, worship dead spirits. Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some dead man. Sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness. Similarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have seen that in India the lower class people sometimes go to the forest, and if they have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree and offer sacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship. God worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is said, sattva\u1e41 vi\u015buddham v\u0101sudeva-\u015babditam. \"When a man is situated in pure goodness, he worships V\u0101sudeva.\" The purport is that those who are completely purified of the material modes of nature and who are transcendentally situated can worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\nThe impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness, and they worship five kinds of demigods. They worship the impersonal Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form in the material world, which is known as philosophized Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the impersonalists, because they do not ultimately believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, imagine that the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form is just another aspect of the impersonal Brahman; similarly, they imagine that Lord Brahm\u0101 is the impersonal form in the material mode of passion. Thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that are worshipable, but because they think that the actual truth is impersonal Brahman, they dispose of all worshipable objects at the ultimate end. In conclusion, the different qualities of the material modes of nature can be purified through association with persons who are of transcendental nature.\n\n**Question 1 : What examples have been given in this verse to explain the mode of worship of people in the mode of goodness, passion and ignorance ? How a person situated on the transcendental platform different from them ?**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/4](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/4)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 50031, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 17.4", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565736224, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cnzor3/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_174/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "purple_snakes10", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_p1gavkc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565337526, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cnz8gm/how_does_one_accept_the_way_life_is_and_that/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cnz8gm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cnz8gm/how_does_one_accept_the_way_life_is_and_that/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565337527, "score": 8, "selftext": "Let me just begin I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. So I feel scared and sad all the time. But recently it's been at it's worst. About 3 weeks ago I moved out my mums house for the first time. In the first week it was fun as it was still new and I was hanging out with my coworkers often but commences the second week it's been really hard since then. I've cried very morning and every evening and tears form even when I'm at work. Reason being is that I miss my family my mum especially. \n\nWhat gets to me is the fact that that part of my life is gone seeing my mum everyday being able to run downstairs or to her room to talk to her now I need to get two trains. I'm missing her soo much and life doesn't last forever but here I am wasting it at a job all for what ? A career that has no meaning for money to survive. I can't accept that our lives consist of wasting time at jobs we hate just for money instead of doing things we love in my case it would be traveling, writing and family. \n\nBut I guess this is how life must go we grow up we move away and we work and we die. I'm not as bothered about my own death in this context but more that of my loved ones I'm just wasting my time working because it's what we have to do when I should be spending it enjoying my loved ones lives and my own as much as I can. \n\nI'm having a hard time accepting that this is how life goes. This everyones saying you get used to it.

I am having a difficult time fully understanding, yet it also brings a cold clarity to many of the fundamental parts of my Self, as well as many of my experiences.

This has largely been the focal point of all of my pursuits in life, including even my professional endeavors. Before I even consciously understood what I was doing, I moved toward the deepest longings of my heart: to hear another's story, to have another hear my own, and to experience love through the shared articulation of those stories so that we might heal one another.

Perhaps it is possible that we manifested each each other. \n\nI believe he knew me before I did. We are exactly the same, but we each heal the other in the spaces of our shared differences. \n\nNo words are needed between us, but he hears everything I say. \n\nBut can we continue to live like this?

I didnt have any friends, no cell phone either, so that's how I spent my time. I don't know if they are connected, I was also victim of terrible sleep paralysis. I would wake up to dark cloaked figures in my room and by my bedside. Other than that, I would get symbolic dreams very often. That night was no exception.\n\nThat night I dreamt I was in Egypt. A Pharoah, dressed from head to toe in gold, stood in a small boat with men sitting and rowing at his sides. There were pyramids and sand all around, but the Pharoah and his men were on the bluest sea I'd ever laid eyes on. The Pharoah was pointing off into the horizon where the sky met the water. After that, a flying boar crossed their path as if to lead the way. It was black, but had golden/white wings and a gold symbol grown into it's side. It was all so beautiful.\n\nThen I *woke up*.\n\nI opened my eyes and all I could hear was loud chanting and the beating of African drums. I was paralyzed and terrified. I then felt myself falling and being ripped from my bed. I was taken out of my physical body and was levitating in midair. I looked around and saw at least 4-5 indigo/purple figures taking me out of my room. As we reached the door, I saw myself lying in bed peacefully. My eyes were the last to go through the door way.\n\nThen I woke up. Exactly 3:30. I have no memory of what happened in the lost time.\n\nI still wonder what it was that happened to me that night.

I\u2019m in my 20\u2019s as is my fianc\u00e9 and we have been going through a rough patch in life. I stay at home with our 1 year old and he works tirelessly throughout the day. I see him struggling and the stress he puts himself through for us is wearing on him physically and mentally. It hurts me that there\u2019s not much I can do to ease his stress. Now I\u2019ve always been a spiritual person and I talk to angels often and ask for guidance, usually at night before I fall asleep when I have a clear mind and no distractions. I had read earlier that day on this sub about getting in touch with higher self, which I had never done so I thought I would try it out, but try to get in touch with fianc\u00e9s higher self instead. So as he was sleeping next to me, I was asking his higher self if there was anything I could do or say to help him get in touch with his higher self. And I could feel his presence. My fianc\u00e9 in physical is pretty quiet a lot, and quite defensive.. but his higher self is so loving and social and just so free. I\u2019ve always seen this in my fianc\u00e9 though it rarely shows. I could feel the excitement from his higher self and suddenly I felt this heaviness all around my body, almost like I was being squeezed, now normally I would be extremely uncomfortable by this as I am a bit claustrophobic, butit was such a comforting feeling. I realized that i think his higher self was hugging me. What I got from him in order to help out my fianc\u00e9 get in touch, was to just almost \u201cgo with the flow\u201d and higher self will guide me throughout the days to help him. I\u2019m sorry if this was confusing. But congratulations you made to the end!

How he can elevate himself to a higher mode ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** \"Those who know the rules and regulations of the scriptures, but, out of laziness or indolence, give up following these rules and regulations, are governed by the modes of material nature. According to their previous activities in the modes of goodness, passion or ignorance, they acquire a nature which is of a specific quality. The association of the living entity with the different modes of nature has been going on perpetually since the living entity is in contact with material nature. Thus he acquires different types of mentality according to his association with the material modes. But this nature can be changed if one associates with a bona fide spiritual master and abides by his rules and the scriptures. Gradually, one can change his position from ignorance to goodness, or from passion to goodness. The conclusion is that blind faith in a particular mode of nature cannot help a person become elevated to the perfectional stage. One has to consider things carefully, with intelligence, in the association of a bona fide spiritual master. Thus one can change his position to a higher mode of nature.\"  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 17.2, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/cnmsjn/qa\\_verse\\_no\\_172/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/cnmsjn/qa_verse_no_172/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49875, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "QA : Verse no. 17.2", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565729887, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cnmsr1/qa_verse_no_172/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TigerDriverCentral", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3xk3kebs", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565275565, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cnmr6d/conflicting_life_path_numbers/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cnmr6d", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "d15cecf0-8418-11e7-a68f-0ee29c473ac4", "link_flair_text": "Numerology", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cnmr6d/conflicting_life_path_numbers/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565275567, "score": 1, "selftext": "When I do the left-to-right addition method I am a 33/6.

I would say I\u2019m a slight empath, ever since I was little I could feel where people are feeling pain in their body when they touched me or when I touched them \n\n  Anyways, I\u2019ve been communicating with the universe, angels, and spirit guides for a while now, asking for signs. I\u2019ve always received signs, angel numbers, and messages, to a point where I have a hundred percent belief in it with no room for doubt. \n\n  However, I\u2019ve always wanted to contact my spirit guides and talk to them face to face. I\u2019ve only communicated to them through messages. So I set out to meet my spirit guide mostly by asking to see them in my dreams and doing those spirit guide meditations on YouTube. It never worked really. \n\n  Confused, I did a little more research and concluded that I\u2019m not as spiritually connected to the cosmos as I thought I was. I was always hesitant about opening my third eye and balancing all my chakras because I love this physical world, physical relationship, and the thought of being human. But now that I saw this was stoping me from seeking guidance, o decided to open my crown chakra as it heightens spiritual connection. \n\n  So I did the whole visualization thing and listened to the frequency that was supposed to open the crown chakra last night. \n\n  To be honest, I was conscious while it was playing and only a few moments I drifted into a weak sleep, I blame that on the fact I\u2019m missing a few pillows of my bed tonight and I\u2019m not feeling as comfortable. \n\n  But I remember near the end of this whole five hour long session of listening to that one frequency, I was in thought about something and then all of a sudden, I had this...vision. \n\n  It lasted maybe seven seconds but I first saw this curling and it was this circular ceiling of a golden pavilion looking structure and the middle of the ceiling was cut out and you could see the cosmos. And the it\u2019s like everything shifted downwards and I saw two people. One was someone sprawled on the floor and there was someone else....this figure. \n\n  The figure was standing up and he (I\u2019m assuming) was bald and wore this orange-yellow clothing. I don\u2019t remember exactly what the clothes looked like but it was that color. And the way my vision of this was set up was like I was above them, not directly so I could somewhat see a face on the man standing up and my vision was just slowly zooming into them. \n\n  Now keep in mind, I got this vision while I was awake amd for those few seconds of the vision, it was as if I couldn\u2019t control my thoughts. \n\n  Regardless I remembered throughout this whole vision my heart all of a sudden started beating so hard I could feel it in my ears and my whole body was shaking. But it left instantly when the vision left too. \n\n  I remember trying to ask the man standing up what his name was or who he is or something like that but then the vision left. And my heart was back to normal and everything was back and I just heard the frequency in the background. \n\n  Now looking back, I think the man standing up was a monk. I have no clue about who was on the floor. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s my spirit guides but before sleeping I did convey I would like any angels, spirit guides, god, or anything of high spiritual vibration to be in my life and I have it permission to converse with me. \n\n  I don\u2019t know where the vision came from it definitely does not relate to my thoughts before it, and again I had no control over it. Im left amazed by it really and I\u2019m excited for the future and my future relationship with my spirit guide- if that person was even my spirit guide.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49845, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Weird Experience with Opening Crown Chakra", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565728418, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cnjudz/weird_experience_with_opening_crown_chakra/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "pujashoppe", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_qizvg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565257910, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cnji6r/right_ways_of_performing_sawan_shivaratri_earn/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cnji6r", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cnji6r/right_ways_of_performing_sawan_shivaratri_earn/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565257912, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49842, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Right Ways of Performing Sawan Shivaratri &amp; Earn Blessings", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565728253, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cnji6r/right_ways_of_performing_sawan_shivaratri_earn/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "EliteBossSniper", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3dnkep8d", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565257091, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cnjdta/starting_seeing_thingsdots_overnight_started_7/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cnjdta", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cnjdta/starting_seeing_thingsdots_overnight_started_7/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565257093, "score": 2, "selftext": "Alright boys get ready because this is going to be a looooong one. When I was a young child around the age 5-8, I believe it was more around 6 or 7 not sure don't really remember. I had been watching a movie with overnight not completely sure what it was about, but it may have involved competitive sledding not sure really that's my best guess. So, everything is pretty a pretty normal day/night and we finish the movie and I head off to bed..... Now this is when shit gets more real. I woke up in the middle of the night \\*note my bed was more elevated when I was younger it was kind of like a bunk bed but without the bottom one.\\* Anyways I for some unknown reason wake up with and I wake up looking up and I see this awful tentacle thing just floating above me just wagging it's tentacles like a spider the size of a grown man's fist and then some. This thing was just floating above me I could see it in full 3d. I'm not 100% sure if I noticed it immediately but this is when I first started seeing dots everywhere that I looked. I was completely terrified and bolted down my ladder and ran into the hallway and turned on the light and then proceeded to run into my parents room scared shitless about this thing looking like a demon straight out of hell is just floating above me. I woke up in the middle of the night for no reason at all just seeing this thing in front of me. I'm not sure if I was scared before I saw it or as just as I saw it, but I woke up just full on sixth sensing this shit knowing something was wrong. So I had ran into my parents room told them everything I saw I think they thought I was just having a nightmare or something at the time not 100% sure. So basically I slept in between them and it took them a while to calm me down. So as i'm calmed down they finally turned off the light a lamp to the left of my mother and this man appeared in the hallway in a white suit, black, afro, and he's singing and dancing with a one of those stage microphones no sound at all and I'm just seeing this in my hallway full color. I asked my mom if she could see this man, but she couldn't, and also for some reason wasn't scared of this mysterious man in a white suit. So I turn on the lamp to the next of me and I see this man disappear, and I flick it off he's back resuming position and I do this a bunch of times and he's just keeps coming back meanwhile my mom is staring at me like i'm a crazy person. So this basically goes on as me staring at this man not even scared when my mom decides to just leave the lamp on so I don't see him anymore. \\*Note that was the last time I saw any of those fully fledged things in color or black and white.\\* So I wake up in my parents bedroom starting to notice these dots more than I did yesterday and instead of these things being in full color they're now just transparent but just as scary to little 7 year old me. I'm basically dragged to my room by my parents supposed to be changing out of my spongebob pajamas, but then this big ass dog comes out of no where transparent just rushing me and I'm like what the fuck and I just run back to my parents room hysterical about this giant ass dog that's trying to murder me. I'm asking to stay home get declined while this dog is still on my ass, so I end up actually staying home in the end. Now this next part is where some good starts to come out of this. 7 year old me had millions to billions of buildings floating around him that were transparent and just flying through the ground and up, so like a intelligent 7 year old I told my parents and started playing dodge the buildings. I even remember seeing the Eiffel Tower once! Now all these buildings were in miniature castle size type things like as big as a small box. At this point my parents are starting to get worried and realize that i'm not bsing around, so they take me to doctors upon doctors getting me tested to see what's wrong with me, but bam nothing is wrong. I was the same exact physically that I was the night before I woke up, at least I think anyway. So, fast forward to the next day agaaain I'm at school for the first time and I realize that I'm seeing letters/numbers floating around me and it's pretty entertaining instead of learning because screw learning am I right guys? So these big ass floating numbers are keeping me company and these things i'm seeing aren't scaring me at all. Also I need to mention I see these things better in the dark, but back then when I first starting seeing these things and I hadn't started suppressing it yet I could see it really well in the day. It's possible that I stopped seeing color because I was actually suppressing it from the beginning, but I'm not completely sure. So back to school I started noticing that I'm seeing outlines around people some are basic white and sometimes they're color \\*this stuck with me for a longggg time\\* I was reminded of seeing color around people when I was staring at my foot and saw a yellow outline appear at it after a little bit. I've even karate chopped the air because I saw green starting to surround this sign thing. So basically fast forward again into night I was basically terrorized by these things and I had to literally stare into my pillow to not see them even though I still see the basic component of these things with my eyes closed. The basic component is dots by the way. So fast forward more throughout my life I get terrorized by these things sometimes and have fun with it other times. The more I aged on the more I suppressed these things because I was told they weren't normal and they scared the shit out of me. If you guys remember the tentacle demon looking thing I saw like 4 of these floating in my room once in the middle of the night I was a bit older this time so I stayed more calm and got the light on since it weakens my perception of these things. They still scared the hell out of me though even though they were just transparent this time. Now lets fast forward way more into my life I've suppressed these things so well that all I can see are just the dots which at this current point in my life that's all I see, so I get the urge to google what these things are again and I find this one guy talking about how if he focuses he can control them, so I think to myself shit why don't I try this so I'm staring at my wall focusing on these dots and I actually start to move them and shift them into the things I used to see when I was a child, but I'm not really shifting them that much just to the point where I can control their basic movement and shape if you guys remember earlier how when I was in class I used to see numbers and shapes pop out at me? I did that again. I also discovered I could change the colors of these dots if I focused really hard too. After a while I started to suppress them again and stopped trying to control them so I just let it go for a while until I ended up opening up to my friend about it a week ago or so. And recently I've started focusing on them more now, and that's when I saw the color forming around my foot again which reminded me of that too, so here I am 15 becoming 16 pretty soon and I'm still searching for what's wrong with me, and why I can still see these dots... so redditors does anyone have any idea what's wrong with me or have any sort of idea what happened to me overnight?   \n\n\nSorry for the long write up btw I just had to get it down on paper and It all kept coming back to me", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49841, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Starting seeing things/dots overnight started 7+ years ago", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565728192, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cnjdta/starting_seeing_thingsdots_overnight_started_7/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "sonny9955", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_44dqbrs7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565254475, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cnj0d5/how_to_magically_manifest_real_spendable_cash/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cnj0d5", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cnj0d5/how_to_magically_manifest_real_spendable_cash/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565254477, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49833, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How To Magically Manifest REAL, Spendable Cash...

The living being is said to be of a particular faith according to the modes he has acquired.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nEveryone has a particular type of faith, regardless of what he is. But his faith is considered good, passionate or ignorant according to the nature he has acquired. Thus, according to his particular type of faith, one associates with certain persons. Now the real fact is that every living being, as is stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, is originally the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of material nature. But when one forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and comes into contact with the material nature in conditional life, he generates his own position by association with the different varieties of material nature. The resultant artificial faith and existence are only material. Although one may be conducted by some impression, or some conception of life, still, originally, he is nirgu\u1e47a, or transcendental. Therefore one has to become cleansed of the material contamination that he has acquired in order to regain his relationship with the Supreme Lord. That is the only path back without fear: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then that path is guaranteed for his elevation to the perfectional stage. If one does not take to this path of self-realization, then he is surely to be conducted by the influence of the modes of nature.\n\nThe word sattva, or faith, is very significant in this verse. Sattva or faith always comes out of the works of goodness. One's faith may be in a demigod or some created God or some mental concoction. It is supposed to be one's strong faith in something that is productive of the works of material goodness. But in material conditional life, no works of material nature are completely purified. They are mixed. They are not in pure goodness. Pure goodness is transcendental; in purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As long as one's faith is not completely in purified goodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature. The contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart. Therefore according to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of material nature, one's faith is established. It should be understood, that if one's heart is in the mode of goodness, his faith is also in the mode of goodness. If his heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode of passion. And if his heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his faith is also thus contaminated. Thus we find different types of faith in this world, and there are different types of religions due to different types of faith. The real principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness, but because the heart is tainted, we find different types of religious principles. Thus according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of worship. \n\n**Question 1 : Why there are different types of religions in the world ?**\n\n**Question 2 : Why the word sattva is very significant with reference to this verse ?**\n\n**Question 3 : How a living entity comes into contact with material nature ?**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/3](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/3)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49832, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 17.3", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565727935, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cniv4v/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_173/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LoveWins1997", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_452lb9o0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565245274, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cnhp28/the_secret_truth_about_authenticity/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cnhp28", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cnhp28/the_secret_truth_about_authenticity/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565245275, "score": 2, "selftext": "Ahh.

I'm genesisrose66, and I lead a small spiritual group within my community that revolves around the use of charms and figures in order to create mental manifestations called tulpa. About two years ago I began searching for kindred spirits after spending three years in Bhutan and Tibet, learning about Buddhism and the more transcendental aspects of spirituality as a whole. I have now made it my mission to both educate and answer questions people have about my group's beliefs, as well as the healing power of the tulpa and what I like to call, the \"Datura Effect\".\n\nMany years ago, I was suffering from drug abuse and living destitute on the streets of Seattle. I encountered some Buddhist monks, who helped to clothe and feed me and to give me a roof above my head several times a week. I decided to first try getting clean, but I found it difficult until I was introduced to the idea of a tulpa, a manifestation of one's energy. I named my tulpa, \"Genesis\" after the first book of the Bible, because it represented a new beginning for me. Genesis is who I credit with helping me stray towards the path of light, and I took it among myself after I got a stable job to eventually use my savings to travel not as a missionary, but as a student. I learned a great many things along my travels, including what I believe to be a way to transform traumatic and terrible memories into tulpa, to be used as messengers towards the light. My group, known as the Rose Quartz Church, has been very small for many years, but now we are finally branching out and looking to the internet to expand our reach. We believe in esoteric Buddhism, mixed with an understanding of the most primal variants of Old Testament Christianity.\n\nThat's all, just thought I'd share my beliefs with you all. I look forward to learning about all your beliefs as time passes, and sharing my own insights in the future as well. Have any of you had experiences with tulpas in the past, or possess one currently?

I have been branching out into meditation, some metaphysical studies, as well as more self-directed and focused Qigong. With that being said, I wanted to share some of my progress with you all!\n\nThese days, when I meditate or do Qigong, I can actually feel and see, in my mind's eye, the energy within me. I can feel myself moving chi (energy) around and becoming stronger in some way. I can see my chakras growing larger and spinning slowly with all of the various colors and elements. Sometimes, when I am doing various Qigong movements, I feel very connected to specific elements. For example, there is one form that I do, which feels as if I am the moon pulling the tides in and out. It is a very powerful feeling. I have been doing this exercise for a long time and only just started to feel these sensations. \n\nAnother experience that I wanted to share with you was an experience that I had in meditation today... It seems that my breathing has been refining itself. I have been really learning how to fill, nourish, and then empty each chakra. Especially the lower ones. Today, when I was working on my throat chakra (which has been a tricky one for me) and breathing and exhaling, I all of a sudden got this sensation that the Earth (universe?) was \"offering\" me my next breath. It was as if this blue wave of energy (relieving and thirst quenching like water, but powerful and a bit forceful) was being channeled up through my hands, which were in the throat chakra Mudra, and into my mouth as I breathed in.

In the Sixteenth Chapter, it is concluded that one who does not follow the principles laid down in the scriptures is called an asura, demon, and one who follows the scriptural injunctions faithfully is called a deva, or demigod. Now, if one, with faith, follows some rules which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions, what is his position? This doubt of Arjuna is to be cleared by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Are those who create some sort of God by selecting a human being and placing their faith in him worshiping in goodness, passion or ignorance? Do such persons attain the perfectional stage of life?

Something was going on for however long, and I like kinda pictured it bursting into flames.. at that point I actually heard a scream and I was like wtf oh shit what should I do. I actually went brave and I said no mercy for this one. And I literally had to destroy it from within. Like the flames bursted from within. Like from its core. Engulfed and enwrapped it. Then it was really non existent. It was pretty brutal actually. Not painfully, I\u2019m just saying about how it actually got killed. As I said it was like it\u2019s core which it was trying intentionally to protect. Bursted at an intensity I haven\u2019t even seen before. Like the flames weren\u2019t like the ones we know.. it\u2019s more intense and compulsive. \n\nAlso when making the solid choice and imagining the destruction of this demon. I remember feeling like a part or a piece of me was \u201cattached\u201d as you will say. And that part (however large) got burnt away as-well forever. \n\nI remember in the dream I\u2019ve been dealing with that demon for so long it actually went dormant and out of sight. When I Killed it.. that attachment on me that that I was talking about. Well yeah. There was a moment where I made the conscious choice without long hesitation to take end that demon no matter what. Even if that meant taking myself out on a spiritual level because of this attachment i had. It was like destroying a previous life/existence. \n\nBeing awake now. I honestly feel a lot better and protected for some reason. I feel like I\u2019ve the evil within has been defeated and forever ridded from me. I suppose this is because of the decisions within the dream.. but I feel really cleansed of all those fears and bad thoughts. \n\nI.e - I use to deal with some bad dreams about ghosts and demon attack quite frequently.. they were pretty bad obviously, I felt lots of fear. Like you know when your whole body/soul is made of full fear, when there\u2019s no other emotion you can feel. Yeah. That\u2019s it. \n \nFinal note. After forever finishing that demon. I started getting threats actually. Not a big deal to me but I knew I had to act against that. (In the dream I had like a stream chat pop up, and everyone was saying my name and my best number, and oh somethings after me and shit)\n\nYeah, being afraid was not in the equation at this point. But understanding I have a no life, formidable enemy that will stop at no ends to fuck me up. I quickly rendezvoused to the nearest (I was thinking church but that prolly wouldn\u2019t be as effective) or exorcist. Apparently after making the real decision to completely destroy the part of myself attached to this said demon. It was pissed off and screaming because it didn\u2019t want that at all. But anyways there I went. It was saying it\u2019s on the way, and I knew obviously it must\u2019ve distanced itself very far thinking it was fastened to me securely. Welp. Not anymore. Bichhh. I\u2019ve freed myself. \n\nSo yeah. Idk what will happen later now. But all of this was just a dream anyways. I do feel better though knowing that I have permanently destroyed an attachment. This much I know because although being in a dream, it was still an effective and fully conscious decision. Even more so than being \u201cawake\u201d. All I know is I think I could do without those kind of spooky dreams now.. \ud83d\ude28\n\n\n\n(Certain demons have certain tactics, so if you do need help just lemme know cus I have some information about that)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49641, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Dead demons", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565264734, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cn4qet/dead_demons/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "pujashoppe", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_qizvg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565175884, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cn4d80/the_processes_one_should_follow_to_set_up_a/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cn4d80", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cn4d80/the_processes_one_should_follow_to_set_up_a/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565175885, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49640, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Processes One Should Follow to Set Up A Mandir At Home?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565262266, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cn4d80/the_processes_one_should_follow_to_set_up_a/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "janie_gray", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3qprpli8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565174560, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cn46i9/how_meditation_can_help_you_find_inner_peace/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cn46i9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cn46i9/how_meditation_can_help_you_find_inner_peace/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "Xj2eMCXLbUQ9omqRct2_EHOJ3IlSR9riV6tQoMZEEoQ", "resolutions": [{"height": 72, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/9yjYYYG_pv0UHpiV33VcNmNC3MIoTIfgAhFIvBgUKZs.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5841ba62b0ca24de774f30aa4c371b140983ec56", "width": 108}, {"height": 144, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/9yjYYYG_pv0UHpiV33VcNmNC3MIoTIfgAhFIvBgUKZs.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=079f83c1bf1c1b3f39484d1acbdcb47cefca8360", "width": 216}, {"height": 213, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/9yjYYYG_pv0UHpiV33VcNmNC3MIoTIfgAhFIvBgUKZs.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c87670b8677e174779d39a53ffa1b21336d06f05", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 400, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/9yjYYYG_pv0UHpiV33VcNmNC3MIoTIfgAhFIvBgUKZs.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=4b06f8e9ecafbb1de9963219a91c1b96602cd217", "width": 600}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1565174560, "score": 2, "selftext": " \n\nAsk someone why they don\u2019t\u00a0**practice meditation**, and you\u2019re likely to hear a lengthy list of reasons. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking.

Now hear about these.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThose who know the rules and regulations of the scriptures, but, out of laziness or indolence, give up following these rules and regulations, are governed by the modes of material nature. According to their previous activities in the modes of goodness, passion or ignorance, they acquire a nature which is of a specific quality. The association of the living entity with the different modes of nature has been going on perpetually since the living entity is in contact with material nature. Thus he acquires different types of mentality according to his association with the material modes. But this nature can be changed if one associates with a bona fide spiritual master and abides by his rules and the scriptures. Gradually, one can change his position from ignorance to goodness, or from passion to goodness. The conclusion is that\u00a0blind faith in a particular mode of nature cannot help a person become elevated to the perfectional stage. One has to consider things carefully, with intelligence, in the association of a bona fide spiritual master. Thus one can change his position to a higher mode of nature.\n\n**Question 1 : How a living entity acquires a particular mode of nature ?

A few months ago I started my spiritual journey, and I've never felt better about myself! But the past few days I've been in an awful mood I can't get rid of. It's a lot of anger towards people that's causing it. Anger at my friend, because she tries to control me and make me feel bad about things that I do/say. Anger at my boyfriend, as he doesn't help me out, even after we have just split up for a few months over it. He promised he has changed but the more I see him, the more I see that he hasn't learned to help me out. And anger at my boyfriend's mum/family in general. He has 3 sisters, all with children, and me and my boyfriend have a son together. My son always seems left out by the other family members. They take all the other grandkids out for walks, days out, on holidays, and rarely take my son. His mum has pictures of ALL the grandkids framed around the house, but not one picture of my son. She is constantly uploading photos of all the other grandkids on Facebook and writing about how much she loves them, yet she only has about 7 pictures of my son, 4 of which were when he was newborn almost 2 years ago.\n\nI'm feeling really bitter towards them all and I just can't seem to shake the bad mood it's put me in. I've tried meditating but I can't focus. I feel so angry atm. I feel let down by my boyfriend, I feel angry at my friend for the way she treats me, and I'm super angry at my boyfriend's family for seemingly not loving my son as much as all the other grandkids.\n\nAnt advice in how to let go of this?

So ended up chatting to him for the whole commute but deep down dreading the fact my alone reading time was disrupted. This is just an example. I've become a supreme home body. I have my professional exams to become a qualified accountant so studying takes most of my time. I've caught the reading bug again so read as much as possible.

Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when you met me.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what happened?\u201d You asked. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou died,\u201d I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words.\n\n\u201cThere was a\u2026 a truck and it was skidding\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYup,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I died?\u201d\n\n\u201cYup. But don\u2019t feel bad about it. Everyone dies,\u201d I said.\n\nYou looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d You asked. \u201cIs this the afterlife?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cAre you god?\u201d You asked.\n\n\u201cYup,\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019m God.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy kids\u2026 my wife,\u201d you said.\n\n\u201cWhat about them?\u201d\n\n\u201cWill they be all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I like to see,\u201d I said. \u201cYou just died and your main concern is for your family. That\u2019s good stuff right there.\u201d\n\nYou looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn\u2019t look like God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn\u2019t have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it\u2019s any consolation, she\u2019ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d you said. \u201cSo what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be reincarnated.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d you said. \u201cSo the Hindus were right,\u201d\n\n\u201cAll religions are right in their own way,\u201d I said. \u201cWalk with me.\u201d\n\nYou followed along as we strode through the void. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n\n\u201cNowhere in particular,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just nice to walk while we talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the point, then?\u201d You asked. \u201cWhen I get reborn, I\u2019ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot so!\u201d I said. \u201cYou have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don\u2019t remember them right now.\u201d\n\nI stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. \u201cYour soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It\u2019s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it\u2019s hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you\u2019ve gained all the experiences it had.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven\u2019t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you\u2019d start remembering everything. But there\u2019s no point to doing that between each life.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many times have I been reincarnated, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.\u201d I said. \u201cThis time around, you\u2019ll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d You stammered. \u201cYou\u2019re sending me back in time?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you come from?\u201d You said.\n\n\u201cOh sure,\u201d I explained \u201cI come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you\u2019ll want to know what it\u2019s like there, but honestly you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d you said, a little let down. \u201cBut wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don\u2019t even know it\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the point of it all?\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d I asked. \u201cSeriously? You\u2019re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn\u2019t that a little stereotypical?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a reasonable question,\u201d you persisted.\n\nI looked you in the eye. \u201cThe meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean mankind? You want us to mature?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust me? What about everyone else?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no one else,\u201d I said. \u201cIn this universe, there\u2019s just you and me.\u201d\n\nYou stared blankly at me. \u201cBut all the people on earth\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAll you. Different incarnations of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait. I\u2019m everyone!?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re getting it,\u201d I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m every human being who ever lived?\u201d\n\n\u201cOr who will ever live, yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Abraham Lincoln?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re John Wilkes Booth, too,\u201d I added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Hitler?\u201d You said, appalled.\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re the millions he killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Jesus?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re everyone who followed him.\u201d\n\nYou fell silent.\n\n\u201cEvery time you victimized someone,\u201d I said, \u201cyou were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you\u2019ve done, you\u2019ve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.\u201d\n\nYou thought for a long time.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d You asked me. \u201cWhy do all this?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause someday, you will become like me. Because that\u2019s what you are. You\u2019re one of my kind. You\u2019re my child.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d you said, incredulous. \u201cYou mean I\u2019m a god?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Not yet. You\u2019re a fetus. You\u2019re still growing. Once you\u2019ve lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the whole universe,\u201d you said, \u201cit\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAn egg.\u201d I answered. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for you to move on to your next life.\u201d\n\nAnd I sent you on your way.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49601, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This story affected me a lot", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565240228, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cn1eve/this_story_affected_me_a_lot/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DadaBhagwan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_qpfwq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565152561, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cn17yf/adjust_everywhere_key_to_happiness/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cn17yf", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cn17yf/adjust_everywhere_key_to_happiness/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565152563, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49595, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Adjust Everywhere - Key To Happiness", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565238943, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cn17yf/adjust_everywhere_key_to_happiness/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "zamease", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_g2rsh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565152178, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cn15tt/interview_with_michael_hutchison/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cn15tt", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cn15tt/interview_with_michael_hutchison/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "jImF7IT5Wfjk3BpBDVevrzUhmyn1Ug1NoXu58r6Avvw", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Ogn9aS-JbbIE5_-jgkOLwxvRARevioZ8qGUYKBWIFPU.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a64af617efca1520856c4809d20163706212cfce", "width": 108}, {"height": 216, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Ogn9aS-JbbIE5_-jgkOLwxvRARevioZ8qGUYKBWIFPU.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed60c7e719bc7c1155f27640e6c1bde89ada186f", "width": 216}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Ogn9aS-JbbIE5_-jgkOLwxvRARevioZ8qGUYKBWIFPU.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de9d52311d3b04e92c281848c01e4106475a0720", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 512, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Ogn9aS-JbbIE5_-jgkOLwxvRARevioZ8qGUYKBWIFPU.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=bb87da16f5139fedfa443424664bec424ee550dd", "width": 512}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1565152179, "score": 6, "selftext": "This is a really interesting interview with Michael Hutchison who wrote a number of consciousness expansion books such as The Book of Floating and Megabrain in the 80's.

Experiences have brought me closer, and writing has been a great tool for expressing that. I started writing properly in 2015. I had a difficult childhood and a particularly hard time in 2011-2014. This manifesto I wrote back then holds a lot of truth as to where I've gotten now. Was my spiritual soul always speaking to me? Does this help anyone? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'This is my own letter to myself because I feel like you need taking care of right now. You need someone who looks after you, who values you - the real you and will love you endlessly. And honestly, the only person in this world who is able to do that is you. One and the same we are, forget all the poetic bullshit and soul-searching facade to cover it up with, at the end of the day we are the only ones who can truly take care of each other. I\u2019ll look after you. I see you in those times, when you look at yourself in the mirror and can\u2019t stop crying, I hold your hair back when you are grasping for air to fill your roaring lungs. I\u2019m always here, I always have been. Even in the worst of times and most especially in the best of them. We won\u2019t miss a thing. I know the words to your favourite songs - but I also know what makes them special, why they mean so much and what it reminds you of, what it makes you feel. And that\u2019s special, nobody else would get that. Nobody else will ever, get you the way I do. The way you speak, the way you watch yourself, the way you want to present yourself to the world. Who you want to be, your hopes and dreams, what you want from this life, this place we exist in. However long it lasts, I\u2019ll be there with you through it all and I need you to notice me and acknowledge that and listen to me once in a while. Realise that we don\u2019t need anybody else. You don\u2019t need to check your phone to see if that boy texted you, if that friend is needing you. Right now, the only person we need is us. Me. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. You are the centre of your own universe, so why should it be any other way? Love yourself more. Love me more. Take care of yourself before you spread your joy into someone else. Because what are you giving right now? Nothing, we have nothing here. You break yourself down and beat yourself up and expect someone to scoop up your bruised, battered bones and make it better. Why should they? How can they when you do this to yourself? All this hurt, all this pain you hold deep inside you, it comes from one place. You. And the only way to change it and to stop it is to look inside yourself. This is a good start. I can tell you from what we know that when we think it is the end and it is all hopeless and dying, that there is better to come. Better always comes eventually and even if it doesn\u2019t come for a long while, we live on in the hope and the anticipation and the knowledge that it will. Life goes on for a long, long time and there is so much to see, so much to be, even more love to give. We can\u2019t stop now, we can\u2019t miss it or screw it up. We have to keep going, keep moving forwards with the rest of the world. Give love to yourself, give credit for all the great, amazing inches of human that you are. All that you achieve and who you are and what you stand for, who you\u2019re growing up to be. Don\u2019t let that light be dimmed. That lantern you\u2019ve fucking carried in your soul for as long as you can remember, don\u2019t let it burn out. Stay passionate, and talented and wonderful and you will show the world not what you\u2019re made of, but what you were made for. You have that purpose, that right to succeed and to be happy and to love yourself in all that you do. And you have that same right to share that love with other people in time. To show them who you are, what you feel. But they won\u2019t be you. They are them, on their own tracks which yours is parallel to, you do not intersect. You were born an individual and you will die an individual. Don\u2019t be scared of that as so many are, love it, live it. Be exactly what you need. Hold your own hand, in all senses of the word. All the things we do and see and how they make us who we are, things only we can remember and feel and know about. There\u2019s no use explaining. No matter how many times you read this or what you try to do with it or however you may goddamn feel, I am always here. We are together and you are not alone. We are together in this and I know you and I love you and I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here. And I will never leave and I will never disappoint you or let you down because I only have the best intentions for you and your life because you\u2019re gonna love it. But all of this first has to begin with you. You, learning to love you.'", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49594, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Manifesto from 2014", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565238427, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cn153l/manifesto_from_2014/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Bossman2515", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2yo3aw91", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565151432, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cn11n4/how_to_attract_anything_within_15_minutes/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cn11n4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cn11n4/how_to_attract_anything_within_15_minutes/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565151433, "score": 1, "selftext": "I know that someone of you will definitely be able to relate to this situation...  \n\n\nWhen I first started out with the law of attraction, it was hard!

And it was by **FAR** the hardest thing to find people to teach how to attract things. Of course, the internet was my teacher. I googled, went on youtube, and even got **BOOKS** to try and find all the information that I needed! I also started to look at courses but nothing! It was a bad time for me because I really needed something to change, but with the way things were going I didn't see any changes coming soon. **HOWEVER!** I did not give up.

This will also be a quick timeline of everything. I do speak about drugs in here so as my first time posting on Reddit, I\u2019m not sure if I am supposed to put a warning in but I am. \nI would say it all started when I was 15-16. I was severely depressed and actually attempted suicide by swallowing a bunch of pills. I was taken to a behavioral center for a week. While in there we would have time where someone would talk about God and play Christian music and such. During this time was very dark for me and I could barely be in the room without feeling rage because I believed there was no God and/or that I hated God. Why would I be there if there was a God that was supposed to be all good? I was let out and put on depression meds and I did get better, my mindset changed and I realized life wasn\u2019t all that bad. That I\u2019m young and what I did was stupid. Got off the meds and I haven\u2019t had a suicidal thought since. Fast forward about 5 years later and I\u2019m with one of my friends and we decide to trip on mushrooms. This was not my first time tripping, in fact it was probably like the 10th time I\u2019ve done it. But during this trip, my friend invited a girl over who started reading this book to us. This book seemed to have been about the beginning of time and how everything was created, and the girl reading it also happened to be someone who never altered her sobriety (never drank, done drugs, anything) and this ultimately lead me to have an intense spiritual trip as she read this book and knowing she\u2019s never done anything I was wondering is she was God. I did get very frightened and ashamed and ultimately super sad because of my relationship with God and during this trip I realized I was wrong and there was a God. But as I cried I felt better because I was being told (in my mind) that God always loves me and that everything is okay. My trip was an endless loop. I would feel scared and then a voice in my head would tell me it\u2019s all okay and where I\u2019m going is full of happiness and everything I love and animals and endless orgasms and everything. So as I get closer and closer to this seemingly \u201cheaven\u201d I would get pulled back because I would get confused, like \u201cwhy am I seeing these things and how about my family and my boyfriend?\u201d And I would  be back in square one of confusion and fear. This went on for a long time of me breaking through and \u201cunderstanding\u201d for maybe only a MINUTE and then I would get confused again. But whenever I broke through I was able to go into any time of my life and watch myself. Then I would wonder where my family and friends and boyfriend were and be worried about them. All this time my mind is also telling me not to worry because my family and everyone I love are already \u201cthere\u201d (and I\u2019m not too sure where \u201cthere\u201d is) it was very exhausting and the friend I was tripping with resorted to calling my boyfriend to calm me down. It was funny because I remember him saying to him on the phone \u201cshe\u2019s tripping really hard right now, I think she\u2019s enjoying it but she really needs someone that loves her to calm her\u201d and my boyfriend lived in Brazil at the time and his voice did bring me back to reality and my trip ended. This also ended my friendship with someone I considered my best friend because the guy I was tripping with tried calling one of my friends to see if she could pick me up and she essentially told him this was my fault and I should deal with it. My boyfriend managed to get my other close friend to pick me up and she took care of me as I finished the trip. \nThis was when I started to pray and thank God for everything and for always loving and forgiving me. Never really went to church but I would talk to God and pray a lot for my life.\nFast forward maybe a year later. I\u2019m engaged to my boyfriend. My friend that picked me up rented a hotel room I stayed with her and we decided to split a 500mg edible lol I\u2019m an avid smoker but edibles are always something else. Anyways we each eat 250mg, get the munchies, eat a bunch of pizza and pasta and then pass out of course. Her boyfriend was working that night and would be coming in late like 2 am, so I set an alarm before everything for 130 so I could move from the bed to the couch. My alarm goes off and I move to the couch. The Netflix profile page was up on the tv (where you choose what account to go on with those square faces) and as I was dozing off to sleep I heard a huge crash outside and felt a huge feeling of doom. I was thinking aliens were coming or it was the end of the world but yet, I didn\u2019t move a muscle. This was all going through my mind and I began thinking of my fianc\u00e9 and how I wasn\u2019t with him when we die. Next thing I know my friend is calling me asking me what\u2019s wrong and I \u201cwake up\u201d with my hands on my face bawling my eyes out. I stop crying, very confused but still too high to move and my mind was super active. My friend was also not able to stay awake and she fell back asleep. I laid back down confused and stared at the Netflix profile page and there were like 5 different faces on there. This is where it gets hard to explain. Each of those blocks were me, but a different feeling. And I pretty much began experiencing another trip like my shroom trip but not as intense. These blocks were different personality traits that I have, one was young and fun and carefree one and kind of childish, I had one that was anxious and negative, one that was very mature and responsible, one that was sleepy, one that was me. (This is the best way I can explain it) and as these different traits were talking to me, most of them were pretty much trying to get me to this higher place, and then as I got closer, my anxious voice would chime in asking \u201cwhat about your fiance\u201d and i would get sad and the other \u201ctraits\u201d would pretty much groan in frustration like \u201comfg we just told you it\u2019s okay\u201d and then my childish one would be like \u201cohhhhhh yeah!\u201d And start laughing and I would be laughing in reality. It was another endless loop until I finally drifted off to sleep but still didn\u2019t get anywhere but I had a better understanding of everything. At this point I knew there were different voices but they were all me. It kind of reminded me of the movie Split and personality disorders but not at the same time. And again everything is all happening in my mind. I would ask a  question and it would be answered immediately depending on what trait was, I guess, in control.\nAfter this I started noticed a lot of coincidences in my life and looked into a lot of spiritual things and got into crystals and stuff. I remember one of the things that kept me from going any higher was that I was confused of why this was happening (\u201cso in order for me to get to this higher place I have to be high or on drugs?\u201d And the first time in my shroom trip I would be worried about where my family and friends were)\nAs I got into crystals and such I learned about meditation and THAT was my answer to everything. I could get to this higher place through meditation. I never successfully got to there through meditation but I know that that\u2019s how to do it without drugs. \nAnyways maybe a couple of months ago my now husband and I decided to take some edibles again and I was not expecting anything to happen but it totally happened again. As the edibles began hitting, we were watching the office and I was thinking to myself \u201cif there\u2019s an answer for me then let it be through this show\u201d and I chose a random episode and pressed play. It was the episode where Micheal decides to make his own paper company. I began tripping slowly watching this and so many weird things were happening, I got this weird feeling to ask my husband if we were really meant to be together and if he ever feels like I\u2019m not the one and he of course got upset and I got very confused because for some reason I had to ask him that and I was not completely coherent and he realized this and he calmed me down by telling me how much he loved me and that he never thinks of us ever being a mistake. I calmed down and we watched the show and the weirdest part was during the show there was a scene where Michael says \u201cnow close your eyes\u201d and I refused to and he says it about 3 times and I still refused to do it and he says \u201cokay don\u2019t close your eyes\u201d and then I decide to close them and he\u2019s like \u201cokay now imagine this....Michael Scott paper company\u201d or something along those lines. During this time I\u2019ve been really stressing about my career and what I am to do and I have been thinking of creating a rescue/sanctuary for animals. I was beginning to think it was a bad idea because everyone thought Michael was being stupid in the show and pretty much I was every one in the episode. Like I just jumped from person to person and ultimately I was Michael and i took offense to this because he was supposed to be an idiot I guess and that\u2019s how I took it but I also knew Michael was always happy and he gets to be with the love of his life at the end. Anyways I was kinda whimpering and then I would laugh at the way my mind was trying to communicate with me, and slowly I realized it was the childish trait talking to me and the other traits were \u201cwaking up\u201d and were pretty much like \u201cwow I can\u2019t believe you got through to her this far through The Office, why didn\u2019t we think of this\u201d but the energy wasn\u2019t as strong and soon I would get anxious and get fearful and I\u2019m thinking it was my human side trying to keep me low and not get any higher because it would make up insane things in my head but a voice would always say \u201cdon\u2019t listen to those\u201d and I would get a better understanding but I guess I would try too hard to understand and pretty much the other voices got \u201ctired\u201d and I just went to sleep. \nThat\u2019s pretty much the last time I had something like that happen, and then I came across this website where the author describes his own spiritual awakening and it was literally exactly like mine but much better wording and slightly different because we all are different. I will gladly post the website if you guys are interested. I\u2019ve come a long way learning about chakras and I believe during the office trip my root chakra was very unbalanced because I was not secure in my marriage. I am not but I still have a lot of blocks that I\u2019m trying to figure out and I know I just need to meditate to get a clearer mind. I\u2019ve quit smoking and it\u2019s been about 3 weeks and I\u2019ve been having insane dreams but I don\u2019t think they are too relevant. As I get more intro spirituality I am thinking that the voices I hear and the personalities are actually my spirit guides. And I feel like I have a lot??? I\u2019ve also learned about our human self and our higher self. and that my anxiety is my humans self that doesn\u2019t want me to go. The website I talked about earlier explains it really well. Throughout all of this I have realized that we are God, we are all one, and we should all love each other and ourselves. \nAt this point I feel like I\u2019m rambling and losing whoever is reading this. I would gladly try to explain more things in depth if anyone has any questions about anything I went through. I still have a ton of questions but maybe I\u2019ll save it to see if anyone actually reads this. \nHave a nice day!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49514, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My spirituality awakening and what is to come next (very long)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565208526, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cmvjq1/my_spirituality_awakening_and_what_is_to_come/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Keyboardtyper57", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2xvbvk03", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565121419, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cmvfd2/past_lives_topic/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cmvfd2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cmvfd2/past_lives_topic/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565121420, "score": 8, "selftext": "How many of you experienced past life visions or practice in those types of readings?

It\u2019s often enough that I\u2019ve noticed. My spirit guides have usually alternated between the Wolf and White Tiger when I need help or company but since I\u2019ve turned 18 they stopped showing up. Now I have dreams of dragons or involving depictions of dragons. My latest dream was simply me living in a trailer park getting along with the under belly of the city such as drug dealers and serial killers. I wasn\u2019t involved with them but they enjoyed talking to me so they didn\u2019t bother me and made sure I never had problems. My dreams usually always have a dark side, sorry. Anyways I don\u2019t have any tattoos but in this dream I was a guy who had tattoos from neck to hips. It mostly consisted of dogwood flowers, spider lilies, and black flames covering my body. But there was also a Chinese style Dragon and two Suns. The dragon was on my back climbing downwards in a backwards S shape from the neck to the lower back ; then wrapping around my right waist so it\u2019s head was on my right abdominal area. The small sun was on my lower left back. The big sun was on my chest to the right side a bit. It had 7 circles within each other and every circle had a different design in it. The small sun only had 5 circles I think. What really stood out was the dragon though because I\u2019ve seen it before in other dreams. I\u2019ve had dreams of a Gold Chinese Style Dragon and a White European Style Dragon before. Now seeing a Black Chinese Dragon tattoo I\u2019m wondering if this has some deeper meaning. I haven\u2019t read anything with dragon\u2019s or watched anything with them either so there\u2019s no influence for me to randomly start dreaming about dragons unless it has something to do with me connecting with my spiritual self again but I can\u2019t figure out what they\u2019re trying to tell me.

It started with needing to get focused and inspired for a job I took that required lots of car time.  I needed something to listen to and get me fired up, and came across the movie \"The Secret.\"  This lead to an investigation of the law of attraction, which led to Esther Hicks / Abraham, which led to reading about other channelers (Jane Roberts/ Seth, Edgar Cayce, John Cali, Wendy Kennedy, Micheila Sheldan, Sonaya Roman, etc).  I have been consuming books and YouTube videos like candy.  I also sought out various spiritual healers to help me through the process.A\n\nAll of this led me to taking a course in healing hypnosis (Dolores Cannon's QHHT method) and starting to see clients as part of the training.  I've worked with 27 clients so far (the first 25 must be \"free will\" / no charge).  The sessions were amazing.  I'm still digesting everything.  Each session is recorded and a copy provided to the clients.  So far I've asked two of them to come back for another session to ask more broad questions of their choosing (the first sessions were personally focused on their lives and their healing).  Last week I finished transcribing one of the sessions, and requested and received permission from the client, a woman named Sara, to share an excerpt about the purpose of life.  This blew my mind.  It was so wise, so beautiful, and helpful to me and I suspect will help others who are trying to understand the challenges of their lives.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------\n\nHere is a transcript of a 20 minute excerpt of the session:\n\nSara went right past the cloud and shot off into space. \n\nSara (SJ):\u00a0 *Everything looks so small, but that\u2019s just because it\u2019s at a distance, but the\u2026the AMOUNT of it is just staggering.*\u00a0\u00a0\n\nScott (SK):\u00a0 What does it look like?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSJ:\u00a0 *There\u2019s brighter spots and pinpoints of light and round masses and swirls with matter coalescing, but it\u2019s huge!*\n\nSK:\u00a0 How does it feel?\n\nSJ:\u00a0 *I feel awestruck.*\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSK:\u00a0 Are you part of it, or are you just looking at it?\n\nSJ:\u00a0 *I\u2019m observing it.\u00a0 I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m a part of it, but it\u2019s just interesting that as a human it feels like there is an amount of importance or differentiation from other things but it\u2019s such a tiny tiny speck of everything.*\n\nSK:\u00a0 So we put all of this importance on the things that we are doing as humans, but really in the grand scheme of things it\u2019s nothing?\u00a0\n\nSJ:\u00a0 *Mmmm hmmm\u2026and it\u2019s like the earth barely even matters in the grand scheme of things because IT is like a tiny speck compared to all.\u00a0 And so the idea that what one being might choose to do on that one planet in this vastness of space is both comical and beautiful. Like that one person or being or animal cannot possible change the trajectory of all that is but yet every single being is so important to all that is.\u00a0 Because without even that one being, that one bit of energy it would be nothing.

And the physical form is limiting, but there\u2019s a reason for that.*\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSK: What\u2019s the reason?\n\nSJ:\u00a0 *So that they will be uncomfortable\u2026*\n\nSK:\u00a0 So that we\u2019ll be uncomfortable and it will force us to grow and learn?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSJ:\u00a0 *There will always be an understanding that there is information that is not readily available to us and when you strive for that information in that is what defines life purpose.*\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSK:\u00a0 Striving for information that is unknown helps to define life purpose?\u00a0\n\nSJ:\u00a0 *Mmmm hmmm.*\n\nSK:\u00a0 It really is the life purpose, the purpose of that spirit coming into form?\u00a0\n\nSJ:\u00a0 *Ultimately the purpose of a life is to just be and to experience and to grow and to add to the collective understanding and vibration of all that is.\u00a0 Having doubts or not having all the answers that one might want to have causes a need to strive and understand and have experiences that add to that knowledge.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what a life is \u2013 is having experiences. And so if all of the information is provided easily there would be no need to have experiences and therefore no need to be alive in the first place.*\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSK:\u00a0 That\u2019s amazing.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSJ:\u00a0 *It is pretty cool \\[laughter\\]. So much suffering happens because humans aren\u2019t willing to surrender to that process and while the fear and the discomfort is necessary in order to push for growth and understanding, when that (the fear and discomfort) becomes the primary focus the growth and understanding doesn\u2019t happen.\u00a0 And so there needs to be a balance of allowing in a discomfort but moving through it and seeking to get past it. You\u2019ll never get past all the discomfort while you\u2019re physically alive, but the process of moving through it is a process of evolution of the spirit. And for those that get stuck in fear and the uncertainty, they\u2019re not allowing themselves to move forward through the experience and they\u2019re causing more suffering than is necessary.\u00a0 And they look to God or whatever constructs they have to ask \u201cWhy are you causing this suffering of my life?\u201d because they\u2019re not willing to see that they have responsibility for that themselves.*\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSK:\u00a0 Are they creating their own illusion of suffering?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSJ:\u00a0 *Oh, absolutely.\u00a0 It\u2019s coming from their fear of change.\u00a0 If they can surrender to the inevitable change of life it would be much less suffering.*\u00a0\n\nSK:\u00a0 What does it look like to surrender to the inevitable change of life?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSJ:\u00a0 *Look at nature.\u00a0 You can try to stop a vine from growing, but it will find every possible way, every little crack and crevice and any little sliver of light to seek and grow it doesn\u2019t question \u201cWhy did these people put these rocks here?\u00a0 Why did they try to stop me?\u201d It just keeps growing. It adapts and evolves as necessary to keep itself growing and alive. Because nature isn\u2019t willing to be easily tamed or confined.*\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSK:\u00a0 And so if we as humans adopt that mentality of relentless growing toward the light, reaching for the light, regardless of what\u2019s happening, if we adopt the attitude of the vine\u2026\n\nSJ:\u00a0 *It\u2019s all a choice.\u00a0 The beauty of nature is that there\u2019s not the same ego mind that gets involved and thwarts the process.*\u00a0\n\nSK:\u00a0 What\u2019s the purpose of our minds and how could we use our conscious minds more effectively?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSJ:\u00a0 *There\u2019s beauty in the growth of all things.\u00a0 For nature, like plants and things like that, there\u2019s a simplicity to it.\u00a0 And it raises the vibration of everything to a degree. But there\u2019s a limit to that because it\u2019s only through meeting challenge and hardship that true growth happens.\u00a0 And the challenges of the mind are to inhibit growth in a way not to prevent it from happening but to make it necessary to make conscious choice to move beyond that. And THAT is what raises the vibration. Any time there is a conscious choice made to bring love or beauty it raises the vibration even higher.\u00a0 A plant doesn\u2019t make a conscious choice. It instinctively reaches towards the light or to the water and so it\u2019s fulfilling its purpose but it\u2019s not pushing evolution of all life because it doesn\u2019t have a choice whereas a human and some animals and other lifeforms in the multiple galaxies in the universe there are choices that are available. It\u2019s through choosing kindness, choosing love, choosing growth that everything is able to shift.\u00a0 The consciousness of everything raises.*\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSK:\u00a0 Why is it important to choose love, kindness and raise vibration?\u00a0 Why does it matter?\n\nSJ:\u00a0 *The universe itself is going through a process of growth.\u00a0 It\u2019s not clear if there\u2019s an end goal, it\u2019s an experiment in a way.\u00a0 It\u2019s really hard to describe. An analogy would be giving children some toys and playthings and some of them are poorly made and will break easily.\u00a0 Some of them are a much more intuitive design and will last for a long time. Some of them might inflict harm in some way \u2013 stepping on them or using them in a way that wasn\u2019t intended. While others are relatively safe and giving these toys to these children is a process of watching what happens with them.\u00a0 Do they discard the ones over time that are not as intuitive designed or cause harm? Do they gravitate towards those that are a higher quality or have more of a purpose? And then observing everything that happens and giving some nudges as that parent along the way. \u201cThat one is hurting you, maybe that\u2019s something to stop using or to let go of.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s like that\u2019s happening on a universal scale. Life began and some aspects of the universe and some life forms were more evolved to begin with than others and the universe is observing everything that happens within it with all these life forms and just noticing the inclination over time to grow and develop and discard that which no longer serves or causes harm in order to value that which is more intrinsically beautifully and loving and positive.\u00a0 Negativity is not a bad thing, there\u2019s an inclination to seek and strive for the positive at the expense of the negative, but that\u2019s truly impossible. The negative is a learning tool. When someone tries to discard the negative, they actually stay stuck in it much more so than if they accepted it and allowed it to integrate into their lives. It\u2019s impossible to appreciate the beauty of something without having something else to contrast it with.*\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSK:\u00a0 You can\u2019t have light without the darkness.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSJ:\u00a0 Mmmm hmmm.\u00a0 *And so the universe is just going through this growth and evolution along with every single being that\u2019s a part of it because it is all one.\u00a0 And, there\u2019s a sense that it goes on forever, but the evolution keeps building and building and building. It\u2019s not clear if it just all ceases to exist once that culmination has finally happened but each aspect of the galaxy and the universe is on a different trajectory and on a different point in development and as one planet or galaxy or set of beings achieves a higher level of evolution they are then able to assist those that are not as far along that path.*\u00a0\n\nSK:\u00a0 That\u2019s amazing.\u00a0", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49485, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Purpose of Life", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565197476, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cmt9iv/the_purpose_of_life/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "usernamealrdytakn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kaud2l2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565106152, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cms7a2/qa_verse_no_1624/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cms7a2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cms7a2/qa_verse_no_1624/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565106153, "score": 1, "selftext": "**Question 1 : What are the four principal defects found in a conditioned soul ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** \" \u015a\u0101stra is without the four principal defects that are visible in the conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the propensity for cheating, certainty of committing mistakes, and certainty of being illusioned.

That is the greatest offense of human life. Therefore, m\u0101y\u0101, the material energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the threefold miseries. This material energy is constituted of the three modes of material nature. One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without raising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in ignorance and passion, which are the cause of demoniac life. Those in the modes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper understanding of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations of the scriptures. In spite of hearing the glories of devotional service, they are not attracted. Thus they manufacture their own way of elevation. These are some of the defects of human society, which lead to the demoniac status of life. If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and bona fide spiritual master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the higher stage, then one's life becomes successful.\"\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 16.24, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n**Related pic :**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/cms75q/qa\\_verse\\_no\\_1624/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/cms75q/qa_verse_no_1624/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49469, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "QA : Verse no. 16.24", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565192536, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cms7a2/qa_verse_no_1624/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "applesandnerds", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_jdtkq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565105853, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cms500/video_conscious_breathing_can_change_your_life/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cms500", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cms500/video_conscious_breathing_can_change_your_life/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "XPSpzubw5gsnrIvGdrg74LAsJZJz_KPl9Ib6hgHRQV0", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/iD_DDziCl09kH1FqlyeGXNBe5H1fX8BjSXij6N2FBHM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80f67a6c91207ec1868bc5483fe430051ffc4238", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/iD_DDziCl09kH1FqlyeGXNBe5H1fX8BjSXij6N2FBHM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6588f92e26b4a9d14f2c7951d4bfeaabfe204042", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/iD_DDziCl09kH1FqlyeGXNBe5H1fX8BjSXij6N2FBHM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1115659070f5a4a22327a36a7c58d12809e3abbf", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/iD_DDziCl09kH1FqlyeGXNBe5H1fX8BjSXij6N2FBHM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=6108a175ff8a7b5bae69e3829fd97f23f67d8729", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1565105855, "score": 2, "selftext": "THE POWER OF CONSCIOUS BREATHING: Have you experienced the physical and spiritual impact of conscious breathing before?

I think it's safe to say I got what I wanted!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49423, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Manifesting", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565175103, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cmp1qy/manifesting/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "throwawayaig10527", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4b9nvyfz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565085561, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cmomcf/i_had_a_powerful_experience_20_years_ago_and/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cmomcf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 36, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cmomcf/i_had_a_powerful_experience_20_years_ago_and/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565085562, "score": 42, "selftext": " &lt;crossposting this as I am keen for your interpretation&gt;\n\nSome background\n\nI am now 42, this happened 20 years ago. I am not religious. I have only told a handful of people since it happened. I\u2019ll retell the experience as concisely as I can while providing all information that might be relevant to you guys shedding any light on it that you might be able to. It was an incredibly moving and powerful experience, and whenever I have shared it in the past it has made me cry, just from the weight that it bears upon my\u2026 soul, I guess. I have only just found this subreddit through the front page and would be fascinated to hear your thoughts. If you think I\u2019m writing fiction, all power to you. I\u2019m just grateful to find a community that might be able to help me understand things better. I\u2019d be happy to answer your questions.\n\nWhen it happened I was in rather a dire place. I had become disowned by my family after several years of substance abuse, mainly with ecstacy but by the end it was anything I could get my hands on. I had no job and no income, I had sold almost everything I owned to feed my vices. My apartment (which I had been living in rent free) had barely anything more than a bed and a computer in it. All the furniture I had borrowed had been taken back by the owners. I was terribly depressed and by the time this experience actually occurred I had genuinely lost the will to live. I was done.\n\nI should note that I had also been having occasional seizure type episodes where my head would incline towards one side and tremble, and my arms would feel like they wanted to move. Not uncontrollably, but somehow deliberately. I had always shaken off these episodes when they had occurred, I was in denial of them. Thinking back now, they probably occurred around once a month for up to a year.\n\nThe experience happened on a Sunday morning when I was alone in the apartment. The last time I had eaten actual food was at lunchtime on a Wednesday, not the Wednesday immediately prior but the one before, so I had been more than ten days without food. Drugs were actually almost a distant memory by this point, I\u2019d say I had been quite sober for 3 weeks or more (but as I write this I can\u2019t exactly remember). I had only been sober because I had entirely run out of resource to acquire them.\n\nOn to what happened\u2026\n\nIt began when I started making a cup of tea (re-using my one remaining teabag again). I was standing in the kitchen of this open plan warehouse style apartment and the kitchen bench faced out onto an internal concrete wall about five metres in front of me. I started having one of the seizures. As I mentioned, at this point I was done with life, and I thought fuck it, I\u2019m not going to fight it this time, I\u2019ll just let it happen. So off it went, and after 30 seconds or so it had taken me to a place which I guess is best described as rigormortis. I was standing upright, with my head looking straight ahead at the wall, and my arms down towards my sides with my palms horizontal to the floor. I felt completely unable to move from this position.\n\nImmediately thereafter, a dark figure emerged partially from the wall in front of me. It was humanoid in form but faceless and in some ways shapeless insofar as it wasn\u2019t, err, \u201chigh definition\u201d if you understand. It was dark in colour, blackish, but also kind of enveloped in the white wall and somewhat see-through. Almost right away it began to talk to me, not out loud but I could hear it in my head. It had some clear messages for me: There is nothing to fear. We are going to go through a process together. I will be with you throughout.\n\nThe next thing to happen was very intense. It felt as if two fire hoses had been opened in the floor and were pointed straight into the palms of my hands. I felt incredible pressure coming up into the palms of my hands and yet I was completely unable to move them. Although it was a constant and almost overwhelming pressure, it wasn\u2019t the kind of pressure you feel from a solid object like a piece of wood, it felt like liquid or wind. It wasn\u2019t painful but the pressure was across my whole palm and felt very powerful.\n\nThe being in the wall started talking to me again, it was now explaining what it was doing. It told me it was removing the blackness. Blackness wasn\u2019t the actual word it used but somehow in the way it communicated I got the message that it was removing the blackness, or the darkness. Immediately it told me that, I instantly felt very, very black on the inside. As if I was nothing more than a thin layer of skin containing all the black in the world. I felt the blackness leave me. I first felt it rising through my feet, into my legs and so on until I felt the last of it leave through the top of my head. Probably over the course of 20 seconds.\n\nThe being then told me it had to replace what it had taken, and I felt a golden colour. It also started at my feet and I felt it rise through my body. It was warm, and bright golden. I would (crudely) describe it as something with the colour and consistency of vegetable oil, except it seemed to also be a source of light in itself. Obviously I couldn\u2019t actually see the colour, but I am describing the sensation of it. The golden colour reached all the way up right to the top of my head, and it was at this point that I first noticed that my arms had left my sides and were now raised above my head with palms facing up. And I felt absolutely incredible, absolutely ecstatic with head tingling feelings of absolute goodness. Words actually can\u2019t describe the feeling as I write this now. It was pure joy.\n\nThe being then told me that the process was complete and (I think very interestingly) that I had been forgiven. Again I don\u2019t have the right words here, but it said that the process I had been through was a heavy one, a fundamental one perhaps, and that someone was going to be with me to make sure I came out the other side okay. And then the being was gone.\n\nI immediately thought \u2013 what the fuck just happened?! That was incredible, I have to write it down. So I sat down with a pen and paper and started writing down what had happened.\n\nA few minutes into that and my hands came out again with palms facing down. No jets this time but I felt a presence, a distinctly feminine presence. She told me that she had been sent to make sure I was okay after what had happened and to answer any questions I had. I instantly felt very cared for by her. I first asked her \u201cis this enlightenment\u201d and she said yes, and I asked \u201cis it forever\u201d and she said (I\u2019m paraphrasing) yes, as it is for everyone. I then asked her \u201cwhat would a doctor say about this\u201d and she told me that a doctor would give me a scientific explanation, and the way she said this wasn\u2019t to discount a scientific explanation but she then provided me with a beautiful vision which I\u2019ll try to describe for you.\n\nYou know when you fly above farmland and you look down and see all the hundreds of neatly partitioned paddocks? She gave me an image like that, and she pointed out one paddock as being the scientific explanation, with the message being that it would take understanding of ALL the paddocks to properly explain what had happened. I really, really love this memory. It was a wonderful revelation for me.\n\nI think I asked her a few more questions but can\u2019t exactly recall them. We then seemed to get rather playful in our interaction, and I actually thought it might be an idea for her to type through me onto my computer. We tried this for a few minutes and it failed hopelessly but we both found it funny.\n\nAnd then she too was gone. It felt like she was behind me as I typed, and then she slowly withdrew until I couldn\u2019t feel her any more. When I felt that she wasn\u2019t there any more, I turned to look back into the room \u2013 to look for her. And in the middle of the room sat a lion. It was a male lion, sat on its haunches, also rather transparent like the first being. It sat there looking at me for only a few seconds and then it was gone too.\n\nThat was the end of the experience. Suffice to say it turned my life around. I hope you enjoyed me sharing it.

Is he in goodness, in passion or in ignorance?**  \n**PURPORT**  \nIn the Fourth Chapter, thirty-ninth verse, it is said that a person faithful to a particular type of worship gradually becomes elevated to the stage of knowledge and attains the highest perfectional stage of peace and prosperity. In the Sixteenth Chapter, it is concluded that one who does not follow the principles laid down in the scriptures is called an asura, demon, and one who follows the scriptural injunctions faithfully is called a deva, or demigod. Now, if one, with faith, follows some rules which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions, what is his position? This doubt of Arjuna is to be cleared by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Are those who create some sort of God by selecting a human being and placing their faith in him worshiping in goodness, passion or ignorance? Do such persons attain the perfectional stage of life? Is it possible for them to be situated in real knowledge and elevate themselves to the highest perfectional stage? Do those who do not follow the rules and regulations of the scriptures but who have faith in something and worship gods and demigods and men attain success in their effort? Arjuna is putting these questions to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.  \n**Question 1 : What are the various questions Arjuna is asking to Krishna in this verse ?**  \n**Question 2 : What is the meaning of the word : \u015b\u0101stra-vidhim ?** \n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/1](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/1)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49408, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 17.1", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565166564, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cmny3d/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_171/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "JasonRevere", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_42chcmg8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565075778, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cmneik/follow_what_sparkles/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cmneik", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cmneik/follow_what_sparkles/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565075779, "score": 85, "selftext": "On the quest for the spirit don\u2019t get trapped in the idea of self or identity.

I try to tend my physical, mental, and emotional needs, but I don\u2019t even know where to start with the spiritual. \n\nI grew up in a very religious Pentecostal Christian home. I lived as a Christian in every way until my late teens. Some unfortunate events unfolded at the church I was attending at the time and I felt like I needed to leave that environment. The events themselves are not important, but what is important is the change that it began in me. For the first time in my life I started looking at religion with my own eyes instead of the way I had always been taught. After several years of soul searching and contemplation, I decided that Christianity, as it\u2019s practiced in the mainstream, doesn\u2019t entirely fit my inner belief system. The problem is that I haven\u2019t found a \u201creligion\u201d that does. So I don\u2019t really know where to go from here to nurture my spiritual self. \n\nThere seem to be a lot of similar beliefs among religions. I think that there is some truth there, but maybe no single religion has put together all the perfect pieces yet. \n\nI believe there is a \u201cgod\u201d but maybe not the celestial being or beings that most religions seem to teach. Maybe god looks nothing like we imagine. In my mind, \u201cgod\u201d is more of an energy (for lack of a better word) that connects us to what our souls need.  Either way, I don\u2019t think that god sits in heaven somewhere, but is everywhere in a way. \n\nI feel like we are meant to be active participants in our spirituality. Most religions call it \u201cpracticing\u201d which seems right.

I used to think of myself as a Christian because I believe in the greater good, universal understanding and love etc., all of which seemed pretty Christian to me. I don't pray often, definitely not on a regular basis, though I occasionally point out the goodness of life in my head and draw strength from knowing that I'll be fine, realistically I probably have (mild) stoic and budhist influences. I just grew up believing Christianity to be the oposity to nihilism, which is something that heavily weighed down my life at one point, so after I had overcome that and stared trusting in a higher power, I thought of myself as a Christian. \n\nNow I recently started reading posts on the Christian subreddit around here regularly, and at first I wasn't bothered by some of the more orthodox (as in by the book) concepts out there, but eventually I started getting scared that they were right and I wad wrong. That I was wrong for not studying the Bible, attending church regularly, living my life the way I do, not seeing good the way they did, not thinking that I knew anything beyond the boundaries of what life has given me. I was quite upset, started to struggle with myself and (ironically) felt like I lost my connection to what in my perception is god. \n\nI made a post on there and got mixed response. There were three types of answers, some supported me within the Christian framework (which I don't mind, I think it's good, I just don't fully agree with what they are saying because it's just not my world) but then there were a few comments that said that I wasn't Christian because I defined Christianity in a way that was different from the Bible, and while I do respect their opinion, I felt like I was being gatekeeped from feeling the way I do. The third variety were very nice people that (in varying degrees of Christianity) pointed out to me that there was no right or wrong way to believe. \n\nHowever I'm still lying in bed awake at night feeling that somehow I am wrong an that there judgment is right. I have nothing against the Bible, I'm open towards new ideas, but this just feels forced and I want to go back to being at peace with life and God. \n\nTL:DR : used to think I was a Christian until I felt judged and forced to change the way I believe by (well-meaning but judgemental ) parts of the Christian community. Now That feel like my way is wrong, though I don't agree with them either, want to go back to being at peace \n\nAny advise would be greatly appreciated now :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49334, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Disturbed", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565147078, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cml3vw/disturbed/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bigballsblues", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_465puz2r", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565059936, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cmkz3a/i_need_to_talk_to_someone/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cmkz3a", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 46, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cmkz3a/i_need_to_talk_to_someone/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565059937, "score": 21, "selftext": "I am a complete skeptic but today things have happened that i cannot reasonably explain. \n\nToday, August 5th, is my sixteenth birthday. \n\nIll just go through the whole story of the day leading up to me writing this. Sorry for bad format im on mobile.\n\nAt about 9:30AM I got out of bed and opened some presents my parents bought me. A Black Sabbath tee , a Jimi Hendrix tee, and a Jimi Hendrix sweatshirt.\nAfter that we put some candles on the cake and sang happy birthday. You know the usual. \nAt about Noon i went to my new school to get registered. I just moved to Delaware from Florida. That was a bust. The guidance counselor wasnt there so we left after about 5 minutes. The ride home was normal. We stopped for some McDonald's and then went home.\n\nAt around 2:30-2:45 I decided to go to the local music store to go hang out with the only people i know around here. This is a normal thing i do almost every day no-problem. But today was different.\nToday i had massive bouts of Deja Vu, whether it was speaking to my dad on the phone or whether it was blowing out the candles on my birthday cake. It was like i had been there in that exact moment except all that was there was the Paisley print you would find plastered all over the sixties on every surface. The only things i would remember would be the cake the voices and what i felt like. Same with talking to my dad. \n\nWhen i left to go to the music store, the initial plan was to go to the Beef Jerky Outlet just down the road, Mainly because im a hot sauce enthusiast and wanted to get a new sauce that i knew that they had.\nBut it looked overcast and a little stormy outside so i decided to go to the music store instead. Which is an overall shorter ride because it is a straight shot one mile long ride. So i thought that would be the better choice. \n\nSo i start riding, about halfway into the ride there is a crosswalk that always seems to be counting down when i come to it, so i always stand up and race to see if i can make it. Usually there is no problem there. But today, my chain had become loose and it popped off. I proceeded to slide into traffic with my bike not far behind. I eventually came into the bus lane which is right next to the sidewalk i was on. So i was sliding, on the ground, into EXTREMELY busy beach town traffic. \n\nA school bus going about 45mph narrowly misses my head by about 3-5 inches. The roar of the tires and the wind smacking me in the face is something that is engrained in my memory. \n\nI narrowly escaped with my life. I was in shock and thought that it was amazing what just happened and wasnt concerned at all. Because my chain had become too loose to put back on i had to walk it to the lumber store to see if they had a wrench i could use. \n\nLuckily they did. A very nice man came and helped me tighten the chain by pulling the tire back.\n\nMe, still in shock asked for some hand towlettes to get that thick sticky grease off of my hands. I proceeded to buy a knife with some birthday money my grandmother had sent me. Just a little 3 blade folder with some nice wood inlays. You can see it on my profile if youre interested.\n\nAfter i finished paying for the knife i got back on my bike and proceeded to the music store. That portion of the ride was uneventful. I was just thinking to myself \"Did that really just fucking happen? Holy shit!\". \n\nWhen i got to the music store the shock wore off and i decided the best thing to do was to text my mother and tell her what had happened. She called me and we talked and i told her that i was alright.\n\nFollowing that i went and played all of the new instruments that they get in every week and just fiddled with some amps and a banjo for about an hour or two while i was still coming out of shock.\n\nThen this guy walks in, his name was Logan. He was holding a Acoustic Fender guitar and he had a backpack on. He too rode his bike. So we jammed a little bit. Me on bass. Him on guitar. Then he goes to walk to the counter. Im behind him. My friend and Employee at that store Avery, is walking with him. And then Deja Vu hits me again and its the same thing with the pink Paisley design in my head and just seeing Avery and Logan. \n\nAfter that i proceeded to go home. The ride was mundane. I stopped at a WaWa and got a water and some chips. Then went home. I came home and called my dad. He doesnt answer. Then my grandmother. She picks up. We talk for about 10 minutes when my stepdad slides a bday card under my door. I open it 50$ falls out. My grandmother says she has to go and hangs up. \n\nAfter this i take my money and go to the walmart to go get some CD's and i also found a cool little bike horn. I go home and put the bike horn on my bike and play the Bad Company CD i got. (Great CD by the way). And then my stepdad calls me out cause the pizza is here. After this i just sit down and watch some youtube. Play some minecraft and listen to some music. \n\nAbout 2 or 3 hours pass to about 15-30 minutes ago.\n\nAll of a sudden im watching twich and my chest gets tight, my mouth gets dry, i become lightheaded, \n\nI think im having an asthma attack (ive had asthma my whole life) so i scramble to find an inhaler. I cant find one. I search through the medicine cabinet, my room, the closets. Everywhere. I cant find one. Finally i look back in the medicine cabinet and theres one. I use it and knock on my parents bedroom to tell them what happened.\n\nThey put me on the couch with an inhaler and tell me to take deep breaths. \n\nIt passes. I drink some water and go back to my room. \n\nAll of a sudden im hit with some extreme sadness like i just found out someone died. So my mom comes out of her bedroom and i talk to her and tell her that i can actually breathe.\n\nI go back to my room and just sob. I dont know why. For what, who or anything. I just know i was sad as hell. \n\nSo now im here writing this. I left some stuff out to try and condense it as much as possible. \n\nPlease PM me if you have any idea what happened today or if you have any tips or advice for me \n\nIm open to anything\n\nThank you", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49329, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I need to talk to someone", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565146312, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cmkz3a/i_need_to_talk_to_someone/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tplt-and-academy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_375opa9s", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565059915, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cmkyz2/the_path_less_traveled_wants_to_meet_you/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cmkyz2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cmkyz2/the_path_less_traveled_wants_to_meet_you/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565059916, "score": 4, "selftext": "The Path Less Traveled is an Occult/Witchcraft server for everyone.

The reason is that for many seekers who have spent years on the spiritual path, meditation really is that one anchor that can\u2019t be dislodged. In other words, people fail so often to stay mindful and reach enlightenment that meditation serves as a way to remain consistently present.\n\nThe problem with meditation is that it is made into a doing - and that is what teachers argue. But I am beginning to feel that the alternative is worse. What\u2019s the big deal is meditation is made into something? At least during that time frame, assuming it is being done correctly, we do become more present. And over time, perhaps we will gain the presence to stop making meditation into a thing and just doing it naturally.

Ill be able to do it somewhat, but just not as much or as well as before. Its kind of freaking me out, because I really want to become the best therapist I can be and a HUGE part of that id being intellectual and being able to read people.

Let us now look at some other factors at play here within this entire \u201ctime\u201d equation.  \n\nTime \u2013 to put it quite simply \u2013 is more of a mental block/experience than an actual physical one. If you think and feel that time is moving fast \u2013 you will experience time as moving ever faster and faster. If you think and feel that time is moving slowly \u2013 your experience of time will shape itself accordingly. \n \n\nSpace is yet another factor that further helps bolster the illusion of time further. For instance, in a non-instantaneous manifestation based world such as ours \u2013 movement from one \u201clocation\u201d to another requires one to rely on a non-instantaneous transportation mechanisms. This particular illusion creates conflict with the truth of things \u2013 which is that everything that ever is, was or will be is eternally present at the exact same location/non-location.  \n\nNow you will slowly begin to see as to how and why time even gets created; and as to why living within the confines of this illusory mechanism can be quite jarring \u2013 to say the least. \n \n\nEssentially speaking, at the very crux of the concept of time are three key things:  \n\n**1. Non-Instantaneous Manifestation:** This essentially creates a waiting period between thought and creation \u2013 that we then go on to identify as \u201ctime.\u201d The same applies to the imagined-hence-experienced waiting period between the (so-called) \u201cmovement\u201d from one \u201clocation\u201d to another.\u201d  \n\n**2. Mental Time Creation:** Those who believe in time are doomed(?) to experience it. For your thoughts, emotions and beliefs are what ultimately help shape, create and craft your reality. This is so because you are all infinitely-powerful creator Gods at the end of the day. So this is rather inevitable. Which means that you will experience the illusion of time in the exact same way that you expect to experience it.  \n\n**3. Control Mechanisms:** Everyone (except the majority of earth\u2019s populace at this time-space nexus) is aware of the control mechanisms placed upon this planet (Earth/Gaia) and its people at this time (by power-over-others entities) for reasons of control, slavery, power, dominance, fear, violence, war etc. One of the strongest tools for achieving the said control is the creation and continuation of ideas such as time, space etc.  \n\nChildren within our so-called facilities for \u201ceducation\u201d are threatened with dire punishments if they don\u2019t arrive to their learning facilities \u201con time\u201d. If they don\u2019t complete a certain task \u201con time\u201d, they can get threatened with verbal or even physical rebukes (violence). At worst, they are even threatened with permanent removal from the educational facility in question. Which makes life a lot more difficult for them as no other facility accepts such \u201ctainted\u201d children on-board either. These combined initiatives seed the fear of \u201ctime\u201d early on in childrens\u2019 minds \u2013 a fear that eventually assists greatly in transforming them into the perfect slaves for the powers-in-command to (mis)use at will. \n \n\nThis situation doesn\u2019t change too much even after people get employed \u2013 although the chances of their physically being rebuked (assaulted) for not following \u201ctime rules\u201d decrease somewhat. But here, they are faced with something far worse \u2013 as disciplinary action (for not being \u201con time\u201d) could possibly range from verbal rebukes (scoldings) to direct termination of one\u2019s employment contracts. To see why things such as employment terminations or educational facility expulsions are such effective deterrents against people refusing to toe-the-line in our world, do refer to the glossary.  \n\nAs you may have guessed by now \u2013 this fear of not being \u201con time\u201d puts tremendous amounts of pressure on people\u2019s mind-body-spirit complexes. This pressure is then felt in a most physical way \u2013 and is felt at all levels of one\u2019s experience i.e. in their mind, in their body as well as in their emotions. We have given a name to this particular form of pressure \u2013 we call it \u201cstress.\u201d  \n\nNeedless to say, this pressure/stress is felt by people at their very core. Its results include everything ranging from accidents, diseases (dis-ease), pains, and destruction to even physical death. It\u2019s other side effects include a continual cascade of extremely painful physical/emotional symptoms such as anger, desperation, sadness, depression, helplessness and the like \u2013 or a mix of the listed (or more) emotions. As a result, time as a control tool is treasured greatly by humanity\u2019s many controllers and puppet-masters.  \n\nMany devices have been created for measuring the passage of the linear time illusion in our world. One is known as the \u201cclock\u201d (with a smaller version of it being known as the \u201cwatch\u201d); while yet another is known as the calendar. The clock/watch device divides life into tiny sunrise and sunset based intervals. Meanwhile, the device known as the calendar divides it into much larger intervals based upon earth\u2019s revolutions around Sol/Sun \u2013 the singular central star of our (Gaia\u2019s) planetary system. These tools are also used to effect a phenomenon known within our world as aging \u2013 but that discussion is for another day. Since people upon this world have been heavily programmed/brainwashed into living their lives \u201cby-the-clock\u201d \u2013 not too many people upon this planet can even as much as imagine life without time or living outside of this illusory mental construct. So powerful is this mechanism \u2013 that even those who flat-out refuse to do things \u201con time\u201d \u2013 are equally controlled by it in more ways than one.  \n\nManipulating the illusion of time is also an option here \u2013 but since most people are downright unaware of their innate Godhood to begin with \u2013 this too, is a no-go for most.  \n\nThat\u2019s a lot to digest at once \u2013 so I\u2019ll conclude things here and move on straight to the Glossary!  \n\n\u2013 Aseim  \n\n**GLOSSARY**  \n\n**Transportation:** Mechanisms used for the (so-called) \u201cmovement\u201d of people or goods from one spatial location to another. To be fair, they also involve (perceived) temporal/dimensional shifts but these factors are not as of yet understood (or even as much as conceived of) by the majority of humanity. Just to be clear here, \u201cmajority of humanity\u201d also (mostly) includes the very creators of these kinds of transportation devices and mechanisms.  \n\n**Death:** A word that indicates a soul\u2019s departure from the physical body. It is somewhat interesting to note here that the word \u201cdeath\u201d implies a cessation/depletion/ending of one\u2019s life force. Ironically, the actual experience of death is nothing short of phenomenally enlivening and enriching to say the least. As of this moment in the eternal now, the majority of humankind does not truly understand or comprehend as to what \u201cdeath\u201d even really means or entails, or even as to what happens after \u201cdeath\u201d (passing) in this reality sector. As a result, the entire idea of death is riddled with countless misunderstandings and misinterpretations within humans residing within this time/space nexus. While it is somewhat true that the death experience can be somewhat painful in our world \u2013 especially in the case of a 3rd density to upward (density) transition \u2013 the ideas that people have of it can be quite entertaining (and extremely fear-based) to say the least.  \n\nWhile some consider death to be the absolute cessation of one\u2019s existence (!) \u2013 others are extremely convinced that a supremely powerful being that is vengeful, psychotic, angry, and downright insane (who they have labelled as \u201cGod\u201d) awaits to meet (and greet?) them post death. And that they will be \u201cpunished\u201d by this demon of a \u201cGod\u201d upon their entry into (what they term as) the \u201cafter-life\u201d. A punishment of what, you wonder? Eternal torture! That\u2019s the punishment that they expect their own parent/maker/creator to hand out to them! Yeah, I know. It\u2019s exactly as loony as it sounds.  \n\n**Question:** Why is removal/expulsion from an educational facility such a big deal to people on this world?  \n\n**Answer:** Because of three things mainly. One \u2013 removal from an educational facility greatly reduces one\u2019s chances of finding \u201cemployment\u201d (discussed further ahead). Two \u2013 other educational facilities refuse to take-in people who have been previously removed from an educational facility (this phenomenon is a part-and-parcel of the fear-breeding mechanism put in place by the powers-that-control-humanity). Three \u2013 being rejected by an educational institute in our world results in (the said person) being rejected by society/the world itself. So extremely brainwashed are people within this current human society that they feel no hesitation whatsoever for as much as a second in rejecting one of their own (human) kind for not toeing the lines of control (as dictated to them by those in command). In fact, forget the rest of humanity \u2013 the said person\u2019s very own parents, siblings, teachers, relatives, (so-called) \u201cbest-friends\u201d and even their (again, so-called) romantic partner/s would not hesitate for a second in ensuring that such a \u201crebellious\u201d one gets utterly outcast from the many echelons of society. Needless to say, this is a sad state of affairs indeed.  \n\n**Question:** What is \u201cemployment\u201d and why is it such a big deal for people on this world?  \n\n**Answer:** This is a rather complex question for understanding this requires an understanding of something known as the \u201cmonetary system\u201d prevalent upon our world. Something that is quite possibly the greatest control/fear mechanism ever built and implemented anywhere throughout existence.  \n\nWhile the original idea of the monetary system is incredibly complex, the core idea behind the monetary system is that whatever is created by a person (out of their own effort) is given a \u201cvalue\u201d by various entities in power. This creation could be anything from an actual tangible creation/product to a service provided by that person. This product/creation or service can then be \u201csold\u201d (that is, exchanged) in order for one to obtain this imaginary \u201cvalue number\u201d in return of the said transaction. To make these \u201cvalue numbers\u201d tangible (so that these may be exchanged with others to obtain their creations/products or services) they are then written on pieces of metal or paper \u2013 and these pieces of paper/metal are then referred to as currency. You need \u201ccurrency\u201d to purchase (that is, obtain) everything from things-you-love to experiences-you-love to even basic things such as food, water, shelter and health-care. So essentially, things that the creator/Gaia gave its children unconditionally are completely controlled and misused by humanity\u2019s puppeteers and everyone in this world is perfectly okay with that. Humanity never once ceases to surprise me.  \n\nNeedless to say, the more of these paper/metal pieces of currency that you have \u2013 the more are you able to do/experience in life. But here comes the catch: if you don\u2019t have a sufficient amount of currency with you \u2013 you risk starving to death because not even people\u2019s own parents are willing to part with their own share of self-created (earned) currency. Also, as you may well have guessed by now \u2013 currency is just a control mechanism created, maintained and controlled by humanity\u2019s puppet masters to ensure that their human slaves continue to fear them. Which is why it is they (the controllers) who determine and assign the said \u201cvalues\u201d to things (as well as currencies); and they who decide as to who should receive what amount of currency and how. It is also they who decide to snatch away someone\u2019s currency (sometimes the entirety of it) and creations at will (citing some self-created \u201crule\u201d or \u201cregulation\u201d) and it is they who keep the most of it for themselves \u2013 without doing anything whatsoever to actually create it (that is, earn it) themselves. As a result \u2013 half of the world\u2019s entire stock of currency is owned by just one percent of the world\u2019s populace (all comprised of humanity\u2019s puppet masters). So, approximately around 70,000,000 people hold (control of) as much currency as around 6,930,000,000 people. So while the latter die because they are unable to find healthcare and/or obtain food and/or water due to the glaring lack of currency stocks with them \u2013 the former thrive and enjoy great amounts of freedom, happiness and every kind of experience (of abundance) that one could possibly get within our world. We refer to this dichotomy of sorts as duality. And for some reason, everyone in this world has made great peace with this nefarious arrangement and/or situation. In fact, dissenters are actively discouraged by everyone else (within our world) from doing anything that could potentially uproot this monstrous system of sorts. For humanity at this space-time nexus \u2013 as a whole \u2013 fears change (and \u201cthe unknown\u201d) to such a degree that they are even willing to let monsters trample all over them so long as it is done in ways that they know of. They even have fear-based sayings here that go something like: \u201cA known enemy is better than an unknown enemy\u201d and \u201cHope for the best. Prepare for the worst.\u201d Go figure!  \n\nSo, in order for someone to even be able to give away their creations/services in exchange for the said \u201ccurrency\u201d \u2013 they should first get themselves a \u201cjob\u201d with an \u201cemployer\u201d. (There are also other ways of earning currency \u2013 but those are not pertinent to our discussion at this time). Which means that they should create something/provide a service to someone (that is, do a job) for someone else in order to be given sufficient amounts of currency by that someone else to even as much as be able to survive/exist within this realm of experience. Just to be clear here \u2013 the person doing the work here is known as an \u201cemployee\u201d; the person giving them the currency in return of it is known as an \u201cemployer\u201d \u2013 and the contract that binds them both is known as an \u201cemployment contract\u201d.  \n\nThe above descriptions are by no means exaggerated. For not only is one expected to \u201cearn\u201d their currency to even as much as gain basic access to food and/or water supplies within our world \u2013 one is also expected to have currency to be able to \u201cbuy\u201d (that is, claim \u201cownership\u201d to) portions of Gaia\u2019s land-mass (from the controllers) to even have a place to live/exist! If you thought that that was outrageous, wait until you hear the fact that even your \u201cdead\u201d (physical) body won\u2019t be disposed off properly within our world if you do not have enough currency to give to someone in return for providing the said service!  \n\nSo I hope you can see now as to how things such as the termination of one\u2019s employment contract or an inability to acquire an employment contract in the first place (owing to one\u2019s removal/expulsion from an educational facility) can literally lead someone to die of starvation, disease or disaster within our world \u2013 owing to their glaring lack of currency/money stocks. People can also have their legitimately acquired currency stocks snatched away from them by various other methods of control and/or other forms of stealing. Stealing refers to the idea of taking something from someone by force without their consent or simply taking something from someone without their conscious knowledge. In a non-telepathic civilization such as ours in which a being\u2019s mind is fragmented into conscious/subconscious/superconscious aspects (with beings only having access to the conscious part of their minds with ease) \u2013 this is rather (surprisingly) easy to do. (Similar/related ideas and concepts known as \u201clies\u201d and \u201cdeceptions\u201d will be covered in later chapters to come). And since (a majority of) humanity is largely unaware of their true power/innate Godhood and their innate ability to create as much abundance as they so desire at this time \u2013 these (aforementioned) control mechanism continue to thrive unabated.  \n\n**Note:** You could also follow these posts on my blog at: https://gaiatimecapsule.home.blog", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49292, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Experiencing Time - Gaia Time Capsule Chapter 2", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565133120, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cmiknt/experiencing_time_gaia_time_capsule_chapter_2/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "cursedsalad", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3bbbms77", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565043525, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cmhx9v/misanthropy_spirituality/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cmhx9v", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cmhx9v/misanthropy_spirituality/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565043527, "score": 1, "selftext": "I love everyone but hate humankind at the same time.

You can argue with any of my points, none of this is written in stone. It's just a guide I go by, and it's still a work in progress: \n\n*Essentials For An Indominatable Spirit:*\n\n* *Wear the world as a loose garment (meaning dont let the worldy affairs get you heated).*\n\n&gt;*All  is fundamentally well. That does not mean that all is well on the  surface of things. But it does mean that God is in His Heaven and that  He has a purpose for the world, which will eventually work out when  enough human beings are willing to follow His way. 'Wearing the world as  a loose garment' means not to be upset by the surface wrongness of  things, but to feel deeply secure in the fundamental goodness and  purpose in the universe.\"*\n\n* *Realize that were all One and thus all children of God.*\n\n&gt;*\"I  will practice love, because lack of love will block the way. I will try  to see good in all people, those I like and also those who fret me and  go against the grain. They are all children of God. I will try to give  love, otherwise how can I dwell in God's spirit, whence nothing unloving  can come? I will try to get along with all people, because the more  love I give away, the more I will have.\"   Its only love that gets you  through.*  \n*\"Try  saying: 'God bless him' of anyone whom you find in disharmony with you,  Also say it of anyone who is in trouble through his own fault. Say it,  willing                                 hat showers of blessings may  fall upon him. Let God do the blessing. Leave to God the necessary  correcting or disciplining. You should only desire blessing                                 for him. Leave God's work to God. Occupy yourself  with the task that He gives you to do. God's blessing will also break  down all your own diffculties and                                    build up all your successes.\"*  \n*\"I  must overcome myself before I can truly forgive other people for  injuries done to me. The self in me cannot forgive injuries. The very  thought of wrongs                                 means that my self is  in the foreground. Since the self cannot forgive, I must overcome my  selfishness. I must cease trying to forgive those who fretted and                                 wronged me. It is a mistake for me to even  think about these injuries. I must aim at overcoming myself in my daily  life and then I will find there is nothing                                in me that remembers injury, because the only thing injured, my  selfishness, is gone.\"*\n\n* *Find something to protect or a dream to follow.*\n* *When  going through hard times dont ask yourself \"why me?\" the better  question to ask is \"why not me?\".. Its you because your soul you're  being tested and trained. Accept this belief and a wonderful molding of  the character is the result. Reject it and God's purpose for your life  is frustrated and your spiritual progress delayed.  Your soul is being  trained by the good you choose. Thus the purpose of your life is being  accomplished. Always have faith in God for he does truely work in  mysterious ways, and with graceful timing.. So even when something seems  utterly impossible you still have to try and believe that it can be  done. That's the kind of spirit God looks for in his Angels.. Remember  that Roses grow in Darkness, so always see the good even when everything  is going bad, as we have no control over what happens in our lives, for  what matters is how we deal with the circumstances that we are delt..*\n\n&gt;\"Look  to this day, For it is life, The very life of life. In its brief course  lies all The realities and verities of existence, The bliss of growth,  The splendor of action, The glory of power. For       yesterday is but a  dream And tomorrow is only a vision. But today, well lived, makes every  yesterday a dream of happiness, And every tomorrow a vision of hope.  Look well, therefore, to this day.\" (Sanskrit Proverb)\u2022\n\n* *Remember that God is your strength.*\n* *Roses grow in darkness, so try and see the good in the midst of chaos..*\n\n&gt;\"*He who wants a rose must respect the thorn.\" - Persian Proverb*  \n\"He  that has eyes to see, let him see. To the seeing eye, the world is  good. Pray for a seeing eye, to see the purpose of God in everything  good. Pray for enough faith to see God's care in His dealings with you.  Try to see how He has brought you safely through your past life so that  now you can be of use in the world. With eyes of faith you can see God's  care and purpose everywhere.\"  \n*\"I  believe that my life is being refined like gold in a crucible. Gold  does not stay in the crucible, only until it is refined. I will never  despair or be despondent. I now have friends in Heaven and Earth who  long for me to conquer. If I should err or fail, it would cause pain or  disappointment to them. I will keep trying to live a better life.\"*  \n*\"I  believe that all sacrifice and suffering is of value to me. When I am  in pain, I am being tested. Can I trust God, no matter how low I feel?  Can I say Thy will be done, no matter how much I am defeated? If I can,  my faith is real and practical. It works in bad times aswell as in good  times. The Divine Will is  working in a way that is beyond my finite  mind to understand, but I can still trust in it.\"*\n\n* *Memories  that were good but not gone is a lesson to learn acceptence. Memories  that were bad were lessons to build upon your self.*\n\n&gt;*\"I  must forget the past as much as possible. The past is water over the  dam. Nothing can be done about the past, except to make what restitution  I can. I must not carry the burden of my past failures. I must go on in  faith. The clouds will clear and the way will lighten. The path will  become less stoney will every  foward step I take. God has no reproach  for anything that He has healed. I can be made whole and free, even  though I have wrecked my life in the past. Remember the saying: 'Neither  do I condemn thee; go and sin no more.\"*  \n\"*You did what you did to me, now it's history I see.\"*\n\n* *If  you ever feel alone remember that you dont need other people to make  you feel happy cause its your life (remember that), your on your own  journey, as are they.. You should be fully autonomous so that you can  progress spiritually..                                                                                                                          Also remember to take joy in the little things, be grateful for what you  have*                                                                                                                                       Note: *obviously thats not to say you  shouldnt enjoy other people's company cause hanging out with people can  be cool.. But you should not need to in order to be happy, cause then  you're not truly free, as how can you be free if you cant be  independent...*\n* *When going through hard times remember that the only way is forward, there are quite simply no other options.. So excel forth!*\n* *Give  thanks and pray daily for faith (its like working out, the more and  more you do it your faith will get stronger).. To me praying is not  asking God for anything, but simply thanking him for giving me life and a  chance to experience it.. And also for communion with him..*\n\n&gt;*\"God  finds, amid the crowd, a few people who follow Him, just to be near  Him, just to dwell in His presence. A longing in the Eternal Heart may  be satisfied by these few people. I will let God know that I seek just  to dwell in His presence, to be near Him, not so much for teaching or a  message, as just for Him. It  may be that longing of the human heart to  be loved for itself is something caught from the great Divine Heart.\"*  \n*\"I  will never forget to say thank you to God, even on the greyest days. My  attitude will be one of humility and gratitude. Saying thank you to God  is a daily                               practice that is absolutely  necessary. If a day is not one of thankfulness, the practice has to be  repeated until it becomes so. Gratitude is a necessity for those who  seek a better life.\"*  \n\"I will  have faith no matter what may befall me. I will be patient, even in the  midst of troubles. I will not fear the strain of life, because I believe  that God knows just what I can bear. I will look to the future with  confidence. I know that God will not ask me to bear anything that could  overcome or destroy me. As such I will pray daily for faith, for it is  God's gift. On faith alone depends the answer to my prayers. God gives  it to me in response to my prayers, because it is a necessary weapon for  me to possess for the overcoming of all adverse conditions and the  accomplishment of all good in my life. Therefor, I will work at  strengthing my faith.\"\n\n* *As  a spiritual voyager remember that your life is a journey, and Earth is  only a temporary residence. You wont be here long, so dont get too  attached. This is not your permanent home or final destination. You're  just passing through, just visiting Earth.*\n* *Your  creator gave you life so you can experience it in its entirety (as is  nesessary). As such he is not to be blamed for anything that you find in  discomfort. Just remember that pain is temporary, as is bliss...*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49252, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Essentials for Indomitable Spirit", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565116738, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cmez1t/essentials_for_indomitable_spirit/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Thepresentishere", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_30z40pbk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565028346, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cmeise/depression/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cmeise", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cmeise/depression/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565028348, "score": 3, "selftext": "How can you overcome depression?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49246, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Depression", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565114734, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cmeise/depression/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "cursedsalad", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3bbbms77", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565026154, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cme0wh/my_understanding_of_spirituality_today_8519/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cme0wh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cme0wh/my_understanding_of_spirituality_today_8519/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565026156, "score": 9, "selftext": "Becoming content with the fact that you will never find all the answers.

Knowing such rules and regulations, one should act so that he may gradually be elevated.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nAs stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all the rules and regulations of the Vedasare meant for knowing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one understands Krs\u1e47a from the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and becomes situated in Krs\u1e47a consciousness, engaging himself in devotional service, he has reached the highest perfection of knowledge offered by the Vedic literature. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu made this process very easy: He asked people simply to chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare and to engage in the devotional service of the Lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff offered to the Deity. One who is directly engaged in all these devotional activities is to be understood as having studied all Vedic literature. He has come to the conclusion perfectly. Of course, for the ordinary persons who are not in Krs\u1e47a consciousness or who are not engaged in devotional service, what is to be done and what is not to be done must be decided by the injunctions of the [Vedas.One](https://Vedas.One) should act accordingly, without argument. That is called following the principles of \u015b\u0101stra, or scripture. \u015a\u0101stra is without the four principal defects that are visible in the conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the propensity for cheating, certainty of committing mistakes, and certainty of being illusioned. These four principal defects in conditioned life disqualify one from putting forth rules and regulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations as described in the \u015b\u0101stra-being above these defects-are accepted without alteration by all great saints, \u0101c\u0101ryas, and great souls.\n\nIn India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally classified as two: the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, however, lead their lives according to the principles of the Vedas. Without following the principles of the scriptures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional stage. One who actually, therefore, understands the purport of the \u015b\u0101stras is considered fortunate.\n\nIn human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns. That is the greatest offense of human life. Therefore, m\u0101y\u0101, the material energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the threefold miseries. This material energy is constituted of the three modes of material nature. One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without raising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in ignorance and passion, which are the cause of demoniac life. Those in the modes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper understanding of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations of the scriptures. In spite of hearing the glories of devotional service, they are not attracted. Thus they manufacture their own way of elevation. These are some of the defects of human society, which lead to the demoniac status of life. If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and bona fide spiritual master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the higher stage, then one's life becomes successful.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixteenth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of the Divine and Demoniac Natures. \n\n**Question 1 : What are the four principal defects found in a conditioned soul ?** \n\n**Question 2 : What are the defects of human life that lead to demoniac status of life ?**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/24](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/24)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49169, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 16.24", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565084005, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cm8u44/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1624/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "beanbabber", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_496mn0v5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564992870, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cm8873/familiars/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cm8873", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cm8873/familiars/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564992872, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello there, I\u2019d like to ask everyone\u2019s opinion on familiars?

It enhances the quality of life, thinking and the soul\u2019s quest for Atma Nirvana.*\n\nKeeping good company has many virtues. The Puranas often speak of the benefits that one can derive through Satsang. It can transform your life, your thoughts, your action and give you an inner peace that can help you to realise the Supreme. Here is a small story:\n\nTransform Your Life By Keeping Good Company-Atma-NirvanaOnce, in his journey, Sage Narada made a stopover at Vaikunt and met Lord Vishnu. He then asked the Lord:\n\n[**Hey Supreme Being, kindly let me know about the importance of Satsang.**](http://atmanirvana.com/transform-life-keeping-good-company/)\n\nLord Vishnu smiled. He knew that Narada, the son of Brahma, is a fountainhead of knowledge; a reference point, a Google of yore. But Narada, the travelling musician and storyteller, was asking the question for the benefit of others.\n\nAfter a while, Lord Vishnu said: Hey Narada, go to Badari. There you will find a worm squirming on a Peepal (sacred fig) tree. Go near its small ears and ask this question on the importance of Satsang.\n\nNarada was a bit taken aback. Did a worm on a Peepal tree in Badari have the answer to such a profound question? Anyways, Narada, obedient as he is, went to Badari. But behold, there were so many Peepal trees out there. So it took some time for the sage.\n\nAt last, he found a worm slowly making its way up the bark of a Peepal tree. Sage Narada went close to it and asked: Oh little worm, can you tell me the importance of Satsang.\n\nThe worm stood still for a few seconds and dropped dead.\n\nNarada was stumped. He rushed to Lord Vishnu and told him what happened.\n\nThe Lord smiled and said: Do not worry or be alarmed. Take another chance. This time, go to Ayodhya. There you will find that the cow of a farmer is about to deliver. As soon as the delivery takes place, ask the question gently into the ears of the calf.\n\nThis time, Narada did not forget to ask for the landmarks to the house of the farmer.\n\nSo, the sage went to Ayodhya with songs on his lips praising Lord Vishnu.\n\nThe farmer in Ayodhya was astonished to see Sage Narada at his doorstep. After paying respects and making the sage comfortable, the farmer asked Narada if there was anything he could do. The farmer was sure that Narada never comes without a mission to be accomplished.\n\n**Narada smiled and said**: I was told that a cow in your yard is about to deliver.\n\n**Farmer**: Oh sage with a divine vision, you are right. This cow is my favourite and it had not been delivering for long. Now it is due for delivery any time.\n\nNarada was happy. And as the farmer had predicted, the cow delivered a beautiful calf at dawn the next day.\n\n**Narada**: Oh, blessed farmer, can I take the calf in my hands?\n\n**Farmer**: Great saint, please do so and bless the calf and her mother so that I can supply milk to the entire village.\n\nSage Narada took the calf in his hands and cuddled it for a while even as the little one looked at the sage with wide and beautifully opened eyes.\n\nThen the singing saint took the calf to closer and whispered in its erect ears: Little one, do you know of the importance of Satsang.\n\nThe calf gave a long glance at Narada and dropped dead.\n\nThe farmer and his family were stricken by grief, but they could not say a word as they had immense respect for the saint.\n\nAn embarrassed Narada told the farmer that he was sorry for what happened and apologised before making a quick exit.\n\nTransform Your Life By Keeping Good Company-Atma-NirvanaBack in Vaikunt, Narada was deeply upset. He went straight to Maha Vishnu and asked politely:\n\nOh Maha Vishnu, has the post of Lord of Death fallen vacant that you are sending me to end the lives of living creatures?\n\nVishnu liked the hidden sarcasm and controlled anger of Narada.\n\nHe smiled and told Narada: This time, go to Kashi. There the Queen of Kashi is expecting her first child.\n\nNarada was stunned. Another trip to ask the same question with the same result? He said:\n\nNo my Lord, earlier I was responsible for the death of a worm and a calf. I do not want to be the terminator and play the role of Kamsa to a new-born future queen or king of Kashi.\n\nAgain, Vishnu smiled and said, No Narada, take my word. Everything would be fine. You will find an answer, but one thing, you should ask the same question.\n\nWith great reluctance, Narada descended to Kashi. There he found the entire kingdom in a festive mood as the queen was scheduled to deliver her first child after failing to conceive for a long long time.\n\nThe King of Kashi came to know of Narada\u2019s arrival and rushed to receive the Sage with full honours. Said the King: My kingdom is indeed blessed with your arrival and that too when I am expecting my first child, the future ruler of Kashi.\n\n[**Don\u2019t Miss: Did Brahmins Of Vedic Period Eat Beef?**](http://atmanirvana.com/transform-life-keeping-good-company/)\n\nNarada hid his worries and embarrassment and went to the palace.\n\nThe next day, the queen delivered a lovely little female child \u2013 the empress of Kashi. Everybody was thrilled and the whole kingdom burst in joy and festivities.\n\nThe King approached Narada and asked him to bless the little princess.\n\nWith great trepidation, Narada took the child in his arms. The little princess looked at Narada and smiled even as the King and Queen were amazed. Usually newborns cry, but here was the princess letting out a beautiful smile.\n\nNarada cuddled the child, stroked her beautiful hair and forehead gently lifting her. He brought her ears close to his lips and whispered:\n\nOh, beautiful princess, the future ruler of Kashi, do you know the importance of Satsang.\n\nThe princess stopped smiling, and there was absolute silence. Narada\u2019s heart skipped a few beats. What was happening, he wondered.\n\nSuddenly, Narada heard a feeble voice. That was from the Princess who said:\n\nOh, revered Saint, two births back, I was a little worm, and then a calf. But with your gracious touch and presence, I was blessed and my rebirth as the princess of Kashi was fast-tracked. This is the effect of Satsang. I bow before you, Sage Narada. My pranams.\n\nTransform Your Life By Keeping Good Company-Atma-NirvanaNobody, expect Narada, could hear the little Princess speak. The King and Queen and all the noble men and women assembled were bewildered because all that they could see was the little princess lying still and Narada standing silently.\n\nAs soon as the Princess stopped speaking, she let out a huge humanly cry and the entire Kingdom erupted in joy once more.\n\nWith tears of joy rolling down, Narada blessed the little one and handed over the princess to the King.\n\nHe went straight to Vaikunt and fell at the feet of Maha Vishnu and said: Oh Lord, I have the answer now. I am deeply blessed.\n\nEven science acknowledges the benefits of good company. Its nature and nurture at work. You are born with a set of genes which characterises your behaviour. You cannot change that. But nurture, or Satsang can modify the genes that spell your character. You cannot change your genes, but you can modify the expression of your genes through Satsang. You thus attain inner peace that will help you in your spiritual journey towards atma nirvana. \n\nThe three births in the story also have a meaning. Each time you come in contact with an attained soul, one of your negative characters dies to be reborn as a refined positive one.\n\nTransform Your Life By Keeping Good Company-Atma-NirvanaNarada\u2019s journey also has significance. Many learned souls or people full with positive vibes fail to convey or transmit it to others. One must endeavour to uplift others and help them climb up the ladder of divine quest.\n\nIt is not enough if one just appreciates the noble qualities in others. One must follow their footsteps atleast once a week.

They were all walking in a line and would go up this hill and then disappear into the distance. Then I saw people without backpacks smiling and skipping around, sitting under trees, and looked really happy. In particular I honed in to a person w/out backpack sitting under a tree. A person with a backpack approached him asking him if he could help him by taking some of the load off his back. The guy w/out the backpack, an empath, agreed to take some of the things and had to put on a backpack to put in some of the baggage. As soon as that happened the guy with a now less heavy backpack walked away and the guy with no backpack was now left carrying a backpack full of someone else's shit. Since he now had a huge backpack which was the size of his whole body he could no longer sit under the tree and he could no longer enjoy himself. He had no other choice but to join the others with backpacks walking in line and over the hill.\n\nThe message: You choose to wear this heavy backpack much of what is not even yours. You can listen to others but do not agree to taking their problems as yours because now you become useless to others because now your limited and weighed down by that heavy ass backpack. If your an empath learn to have compassion but with limits. If you're feeling drained its because you are becoming emotionally invested in \"trying to help\" By taking someone's problems away. No, you must just listen allow them to take shit off their chest. Just listening you have done your job, empath! Sometimes that's all that's needed for someone to take some weight off their backpack and be able to walk a little easier on their journey!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false,

I used to run a medium sized online business that did 4 million in sales. I now, after being extorted for all my money ended up with next to nothing. I am unable to work, let alone take care of myself, and accomplish anything great for myself. The biggest mistake that was made was being too flashy and flaunty on Facebook which created envy from a lot of people. I want to give you some background on the main 4 witches that are consistently cursing me so that you can get a better idea of how badly my situation is. \n\nWitch #1: An Indian male in his mid-20s who is of the Sikh religion and works out of the Golden Temple in India. Through meditation I found that he worships an unjust God. He approached me while I was parked in my car outside of a Sushi restaurant as I was journalizing. This is the man who claimed I had \u201cbad karma in the previous life\u201d and I had to donate large amounts of money (thousands of dollars) to hungry children in India so that I could not only \u201crepay the bad karma in my life, but also of my family\u2019s previous lives,\u201d so that I could \u201cwipe my slate clean\u201d by giving away these large donations. He was also psychic and knew a lot of things about my family and I. I noticed him and his cult have mastered the art of black magic. I also noticed many spiritual healers that I went to after meeting him, are not willing to help me remove the curses that he has done on me. I see no karmatic motivation other than for him to steal from me. After all this has been said and done, I find myself in a position where my business has been ruined and I am so cursed that I cannot accomplish anything for myself because if I do so, I feel angry about doing something good for myself rather than feeling happy. His strategy appears to be driving me crazy to the point where I\u2019d like to take my own life rather than struggle in this life. However, for whatever reason, God has made me strong enough to endure the pain of the cursing that is being done to me. \n\nWitch #2: A female Hispanic in mid 50s that appears to have sold her soul to Lucifer to dominate me so that I can make money to give to her. However, my will is strong enough to resist some of her cursing especially the puppet/dominate parts of her cursing. This witch is one of many and I\u2019m saddened to say that she is one of my family members, specifically my Mother. This is what she usually curses me with:\n\n1. She curses me to avoid getting along with my significant other whom I love very much.\n\n2. She curses me to not being able to enjoy things that my significant other does to me and/or for me.\n\n3. She curses me so that I cannot enjoy sexuality with my significant other; I only enjoy it with other women. Note: Both my significant other and I are in mutual agreement to be in an open relationship.\n\n4. She curses me by invading my dreams and causes me to have nightmares. \n\n5. This curse may or may not be from her, but it appears either her or one of the Witches who are mentioned, are doing bad luck cursing on us so that we cannot prosper. \n\nWitch #3: She is in her mid to late 30s and is a psychic whom I went to for healing after being ruined by the Indian man. She also extorted me for large amounts of money (thousands of dollars) to \u201cheal\u201d me because I had \u201c3 dark Angels surrounding me.\u201d It appears she has some soul connection to me that remains from the previous life. I did some meditation and some testing and it looks like the reason this Witch has so much access to my soul is because we were romantically involved possibly even married and I committed adultery, in the previous life. She uses Witch #2 to do her bidding and constantly keeps me cursed because Witch #2 is retired and she has nothing better to do than to re-curse me every time I de-curse myself and find ways to. Note: these days I\u2019m not engaging in promiscuity because I am trying to get involved with my current love, and become a better man. \n\nWitch #4: This is a Canadian man in his late 20s, early 30s who he likely sold his soul to Belial to gain power so he can seek revenge against me. He was fired because he did not comply with the rules of the company. He was my best friend at the time, and he was using that as his excuse to not follow the rules. These are the curses that he is expected to be doing:\n\n1. It appears to have initiated very high level and death/ruin curses on me because I humiliated him right before I fired him. I did that because of the aggravation he caused me during his employment. So I did a test, I bought him $1500 worth of Ferragamo gear and I told him that I loved him to which he decided to stay quiet and changed the subject. I did not even receive a \u201cThank You\u201d for this kind act. Therefore, 5 days after this happened and after much thinking, I decided to fire him. Prior to this, I wrote him a 16 page letter to explain how I financially got to where I got in my attempt to help him grow further financially, and it did nothing to change his behavior or increase his understanding. He appears to have the ability to create nightmares and sabotage me in the physical realm. \n\n2. Anytime I accomplish anything towards myself I have hate and anger from having accomplished such.\n\n3. Anytime I try to do anything to bring me joy, it either gets sabotaged or I receive no joy out of it.\n\n4. I used to have good luck and now all of a sudden I have a series of bad luck which continues to still happen as of now. \n\nI\u2019d also like to note that I cannot travel to certain counties otherwise I will feel very heavy and bitter. Everything is in reverse where I should be receiving joy and sense of accomplishment, however I continue to receive the opposite. \n\nBecause I\u2019ve been battling this for 2.5 years, I\u2019d like you guys to understand the gravity of the situation. I\u2019m never left at peace, I\u2019m always either having nightmares or constant voices that tell me \u201cYou will die\u201d or \u201cYou will do something horrible.\u201d Every time I come up with a plan, I am never able to complete the plan; they always seem to fall through. \n\nI am on some medications that have withdrawal symptoms and even if I start to taper, the curses mimic the withdrawal symptoms or intensify the symptoms so that I cannot complete the taper. I am currently in a safe place away from the jurisdictions, away from the demons, that these Witches are using to do this to me. However, make no mistake, this is SO intense that if I did not have God\u2019s will with me, I would\u2019ve already committed suicide over 100 times. \n\nMy significant other and I are both of Catholic faith and we want to keep our worship to the Holy Trinity and not do things that will offend them so much to the point where we will no longer inherit the Kingdom of God. \n\nPlease if there is anybody out there who can help me get my life back, feel free to comment. For any further questions or clarifications, I will be happy to answer. \n\nTHANK YOU AND GOD BLESS!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49069, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "HELP!

Helping is always free. but sometimes, people take advantage of free, but Helping others is great karma.\n\nif a master gives you a teaching to a class, one person claims, in their heart and mind, it will not work for them, cause everyone is different, from sizes to thinking capacity, and how you do things in life, not everyone gets it. \nthe master said, if you believe in your heart and mind , you can\u2019t do it, then ,you can\u2019t, and it will not work for you. but to others that don\u2019t understand the basic or concept, they try to make it work, they try to understand it, with their mind, so it works for them, cause they know works, cause they believe. but for those that don\u2019t believe it don\u2019t work, without even trying, then that\u2019s your mindset, it will not work for you. \n\nif i ask you to shoot a bow and arrow, at the hawk, but aim at its EYE, what are you going to do? just shooting how ever you feel like? or focus?\n100 men vs a prince is aiming at the hawk, ask everyone was taking aim and shot, the prince still had his arrow intact.\nthe king ask, what are you looking at? the prince reply eye, eye, eye. the mind is very difficult, not like the wind that just flows easily. \nthe prince was learning to focus his attention on the hawk eye, giving his mind undivided attention to the hawk eye, but his mind wanders, making it hard to focus on his target eye, the mind is difficult to control, but Not impossible.\n\neveryday you practice distractions, how good are you at distractions? one second your favorite show on, you want to watch it, but your phone rings, giving the phone the attention, then your child walk in crying, your favoritie show is still playing, so you said good bye on the phone, give your child the attention, then the phone rings again, from work, everyday, the little things distracted you from doing what you truly want to focus on doing, your tv show. but with the little happening around us, you can\u2019t help but give them the time and attention cause you never showed , or teach them how to do it themselves but rely on your for their happiness, or you know what you got for me, so i need you! that what you give out your worth to others, they find you out to fill their cups worth, and what do you gave in the end of a give and take situations? you only give, what have you taken? \n\nhave you focus your life into yourself, or into guys that have no love, respect for self loving themselves?\n\nmany of you still looking for love, a pass time, an escape, or even some type of happiness to your life.\nin this timeless reading this post you come across, let me tell you. \nyour in a cycle of simulation of traditional thinking. from the day you were born, you were raised BASE on your sex. if you are a man you were taught not to feel, if your a woman your taught not to speak up. marriage, rituals, moon magic, yoga, all these things doesn\u2019t feed the soul, it\u2019s destroying it.\nyou know what the soul is, it\u2019s your authentic-self, your core. before you learn how to think to do things, or even socially be responsible \nyou thought or heard, about love is special, being married going to fulfill your destiny, this is meant to be, let the gods rejoice, you probably heard it all, and ask yourself. connect your life to the past, all the dots to your past, is any of them had ever lasting happiness? if not, and your trying everything, everyday of your life finding happiness in sex, drugs, interaction, the attachments to your suffering, obsessing thinking to a situation, a person, or your mind, nothing you do fill that heart with joy, but more painful forceful decisions, trusting in your MIND that your pride and ego is always right, but look at yourself at this very present, if you still looking, chasing, and even sad that nobody loves you, it\u2019s because, you never took the time to do what you love to do. i mean that in a selfish way. \nin this world, when you give others your time, energy to listen to their problems, help a friend move, spend time hanging out, that all fill the ego and pride, but what fills your heart? truth. \n\nif you live in your truth, you will have no worries, you will have no stress, and you definitely find happiness knowing, nobody around you likes the truth, you from living your truth but you, who is bound to the threats of society, live in a tradition Closet case of unhappiness, living a lie, day by day, constantly worry about the foundation, constantly thinking of traditions If i left my family, i am not a man, no you are a man, or woman, you teach your children to be the best version of yourself, and they can leave the nest or be in the nest but be responsible, worry how your family react if you lied to them saying one day you lived them as a straight man but in the dark, your hiding your face in the sand, in shame. if this pisses anyone off, this is my truth to you, stop \ud83d\uded1 living that lifestyle, your hurting yourself. you going to look back one day and realized that , you wish you lived your truth sooner, now as you get older and older, not living in your authentic self, you going to be regretting a lot of actions you should when you have the opportunity.\n\nso you constantly co dependent on each other lives, hoping the person you are with reciprocal happiness the way you give yourself to them, but it didnt go as plan did it? that proves, this person is not for you. why would i know that? you fighting the energy , expecting it gets better later, tomorrow, it will, but again, it happen, and again, years pass, you still expecting or you already know how the story plays out you are numb to the situation and let god do the work? if you are in a situation, you are the problem in the situation, get the fuck out of the situation, why should you let them be responsible for your happiness? get the fuck out and go find happiness within you, what makes you happiness, and i mean you, not asking others what to do with your life, where yo go in your life, or ask for directions on what to do in your life, until you truly know what makes your soul happy, you are bound to this attachment to a person love, a obsessive thinking pattern. if you think i am bullshit, look at what you reading, you still reading? why? leave. or is there more truth you need? \n\nyou think having a relationship, an marriage and having kids a true purpose, yes, but if you did it right, you experience full happiness at all times, you be called a power couple, but just look at yourself, in this very moment, are you a power couple or just friends with benefits, be true to each other communicate, let the pain in, let the healing start, move on working on your life. speak from the heart, no matter how painful, after the truth of pain, you going to live with that choice and now you can start making choices to move forward, cause you had a heart to heart talk with your past, it hurts, but that the journey.\nin life, you have to understand these experiences, cause it will bring you to a higher meaning of living. don\u2019t trust me, trust in the universe.\n\nstop being obessive, stop being clingy, stop seeking attention, stop overthinking, jealousy, anger, control issues, your 7 sins, once you work on these shadow side of yourself, control them , and that where you truly bring controlled to the self into a relationship that deserves you. \nwhy would you want a man that can\u2019t control his obessive behavior, his controlling issues to possess you, sounds great but how you feel it got abusive? \nnow if this pisses anyone off, you truly do not love yourself but seek out others to fill your cup up. \n\nso? you think you are special? are you mentally ill? you think your god, act on god words, hear god voice? didn\u2019t think so. \nin this realm, it\u2019s all in you head, whatever YOU choose to feel from reading this , is you giving yourself questions, riddles, confusion, anger, frustrated, and you want to give me a piece of your mind, and then what? you can keep your shit to yourself, your probably confused at yourself cause you saw the truth, and your hurt, and now you want answers, guess what, live your life the way you created, live your experiences to your own truth, my life is mines, yours is yours. learn from your own experiences. \nif i am a medicine that need you to go on living, or drugs, you be depending on this profile for answers, when m gone, you wish you learned more. so, go learn, \nnot from me. \n\nthose are still immature at mind and heart, stop being a narcissist or used others to get what you need, you fucking psycho, oh you know who you are, those that only looking for fun. \n\nso how do you accept a \ud83c\udf81 from anyone in this world. \nif you squeeze an orange, you get orange. if you squeeze a person with anger, you get anger. you shake hands with love, you get love. remember to always smile. that smile is also a gift. \nso what you going to do? \n\ni can be cruel in my sayings , it\u2019s cause those refused to acknowledge the truth, rather live a lie, not face up to their truth, so i have thought provoking perspectives, why? if you are born with a role to lie to people, cheat, steal, manipulate, then my role is to shut you down. \n\na man that respects my truth able see how much valuable i am to his life, if this pisses you off, that means go work on yourself, not your mind, but your damn friggin truth to your heart that gives you Happiness feeling.\n\ni push buttons, everyone is blind to their wants, needs, all these validation from another from what is the truth. to what? are you stupid, dumb, or just don\u2019t see it? i\u2019ll keep talking til you get lost around your room. you chase men looking for happiness. you make money for happiness, you are buying gifts for happiness , you still don\u2019t see it ? do i need to get Happiness for dummies? right, i push button, so you can use your own mind to find happiness. why? you going to lie to me? but if you say you are happy, but are you sure? yea? maybe? doubting? hesitating? if you can admit then the truth, you on your way to healing the self.\n\ni do not teach, but the universe asks me to. \n\nyou think happiness is a material possessions? a good looking guy?

Nothing changed, not even the mindset of a open minded. is that what you want? -don\u2019t think of cheating, cheaters or cheat - trust in your decision why you are with him or her in the first place, but are so you with them so you call them a cheater? If you have anger at my viewpoint-  I ask you, if you believe he or she is cheating on you, would you cheat on them first before they cheat? If you made that first act before they did, it was you the cheater all along. Hows that mindset working for ya?

As you touch the fire, your finger tips burned, you screamed, crying in pain. Your parents told you, but you didn't listen, you made a mistake, you learn from that mistake, appreciate it now but never forgetting what you learn. \nNo mistakes, or bad experience is a bad thing, it\u2019s just showing you a better way of approaching it. \n\nThe times when it hard, puts you down, breaks you overs, those are the times when you shift your mind into understanding what makes you tick, accept that nature of yourself, but don't be angry, upset, depressed, or be in questioning mode , cause you won't able to see what you be able to learn if you to focus on the why or what. Don't look at the problem and a solution at the same time, focus on your breathing and ride the experience. Flow with it.\n\nhoping there help at the end of this crazy profile?

I\u2019ll admit, I never believed in any of that before this happened to me. (So sorry if this is long, but it is a lot to explain, and honestly I am still leaving a lot of details out with this story!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe circumstances under which I met X were extremely strange and coincidental since I\u2019d actually encountered him previously, thousands of miles away, years before, but we\u2019d never actually met. We reconnected and the instant I saw him, I felt that the universe shifted. I felt this insane familiarity, like I\u2019d known him for years. People describe the \u201ccoming home\u201d feeling and that is exactly it. Right off the bat, we were so comfortable together and we bypassed the getting-to-know-you formalities that I even have with close friends in my life. It was insane. I remember waking up the next morning and thinking, this is it. This is what I\u2019ve been waiting for.\n\nBut there was also this extremely uneasy dynamic..that\u2019s all I can use to describe it: uneasy. Unsettling. And then a week after we met, X withdrew from me and told me he had met his soulmate, the person he was going to spend the rest of his life with. I was so incredibly hurt. I felt like I was being ripped in half, which was ridiculous, because I barely knew him, right? I\u2019d dated other guys for much longer and not so much as batted an eyelash when we went our separate ways. Had I misread everything? I pursued him for answers for a bit but he was detached and cold, and eventually I moved on with my life. I \u201cdid me\u201d. But I knew deep down that I was not over X, and had this distinct feeling he would come back into my life.\n\nOnly a couple months later, he reconnects with me, saying that he cannot get me out of his head, still feels connected to me, and the woman he considered his soulmate is really just a platonic connection. I was still jealous of her but felt such a deep sense of satisfaction that my instincts had been right about X returning. We begin seeing each other, but it is sporadic and his communication with me is very hot and cold. We also do not live close. Also, there is a deeply unsettling aspect to all of it. I was so fucking happy at the smallest communication, but I would find myself crying uncontrollably for no apparent reason. I felt like something fundamental is changing about the way I see myself and the world. Like I was learning who I am and my worth and my true values, but it is so so painful. I have memories of lying on the ground in a fetal position in the middle of the night, sobbing, with the realization that I too deserve the amount of love I give others. Those were the kinds of revelations I\u2019ve been through, so deeply spiritual. But painful.\n\nWe confess that we are addicted to each other. But X has so many personal issues yet to overcome, and I know \u2014 I understand \u2014 he cannot be in a relationship because of them. He told me this right off the bat, but I can\u2019t stay away. He pushes me away more and more, the more I push him to open up. It becomes toxic in that I am consistently pushing him for contact, wanting him to open up, wanting him to be with me the way I want to be with him, but I cannot get through to him. And I work in a profession where I have formed connections with very unstable, antisocial people, and never failed as much as I have with him. I feel as though I am being the \u201ccrazy\u201d one. I never act this way! What is happening to me?\n\nI have never been the co-dependent type. And he has never been the independent type. In fact, what is SO funny is that we have both struggled with the opposite problem \u2014 X with dependence on relationships, and me with trouble asking for intimacy. So it is strange that we are suddenly in these opposite positions, but we are SO at odds with each other. It cost me so much energy every day, controlled my life, I don\u2019t even know how to explain how much I invested into that. I had no choice. I could not stop the connection, but I knew I was pushing him further and further away.\n\nThere were a couple times he would cut off contact for a month or two but I always knew he would come back. He would say horribly hurtful things, like I never knew him as a person and we only had lust for each other (I don\u2019t know if that was denial or if he really felt that way), or we had different life values, or I needed to figure out my own life and move on. I was miserable during most of those times, but it was like when I would start to be OK with it, he would return.\n\nNow very recently, X has told me that he can never see me again and has cut me off completely. He says it\u2019s unhealthy for us to connect and I need to move on, and that he needs to make drastic changes in his life and follow his chosen life path \\[which apparently doesn\u2019t include me\\]. This obviously really hurts, but every time he cuts me off it does get a little easier, I think because I understand a little more about him and the situation. I understand, truly understand, that he needs to learn how to be emotionally available, to work through past trauma, to be a more actualized person. I have been through a LOT personally and I know that if I met him even 2 years ago I would not have been open to the connection like I am now \u2014 but I am fortunate that I went through that personal development at a younger age than he did; I know he has some \u201ccatching up\u201d to do and I know he will get there. I just do not know if that future where he is healthier and happier involves me, and I desperately want it to.\n\nAlthough I feel deep down this insane connection to X, I have just recently read about karmic mates/soulmates and wonder if that is what he is to me. I am doubting that he is my TF and wondering if I misread everything and he was only in my life to teach me a lesson on how to be better. If he is my TF I can make peace with this more easily because I know that is the way to find harmony between us, but if he is not I feel so confused and lost because I need to move past it. I feel as though I need guidance in some way, or to hear stories or anecdotes. Am I going crazy? Lol.\n\nI recognize so many of the signs of TF (something I had honestly not even believed in before him) but I also worry that it cannot be it, because of the level of pain, and the fact that he has told me he is pursuing a life path that does not involve me. I do not know if he has yet to come to the realization that I have, or if this is truly what is best for him. I also have read that karmic mates can sometimes feel like TF so I worry I am deluding myself into this or something.\n\nDoes anyone with more knowledge on this have any insight? Thank you so much for reading, I really appreciate it.

And when I use the term spirit/spiritual/spirituality- I do not mean religion at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor our spirituality and spirit simple mean our own understanding of our self (that which we call/know/identify as me), our inner environment, and the study of consciousness itself. It goes beyond religion, it goes beyond concepts- it is the union of conscious understanding/development/application and establishing harmony with life and the laws of our universe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe each have the potential to be ground-breaking leaders in this little (western science at least) known field of consciousness. And we do this search through the practices of reflection, of healing the wounds of our heart by learning from our past and letting go of it, simply being- or better known as meditation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEach moment provides us the opportunity for liberation- but only when we gear that looking inwards can we truly free ourselves from the suffering and chaos of life. We already have everything what we need to grow, succeed, awaken and liberate ourselves- but we must dance our own dance, and look upon our own reflection.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo see clearly is to remove what we are not, to seek out our origins- to rediscover what experience and life is like without the attachment to the various identities, beliefs, and concepts we attach ourselves and our own beingness to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've found that each of us are already on this path of awakening, for it is the driving force for the universe (to awaken to its own self)- however most of us are on the rush hour traffic jam approach. Awakening to the face behind every mask in this divine masquerade is a beautiful journey. It is our right to discover this truth, it is our first purpose of this life- for how can we know what life is without the full understanding of the being living it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI like to express the awakening process like this:  \n*Each of our bodies represents a still pond. Every conditioning (direct or indirect), traumatic event, every positive one that goes to our head or we become addicted to serves as a stone getting tossed in that pond. Each stone creates a ripples and in turn a wake that reverberates throughout our lives. As time and our own investment in those conditionings/etc. adds more energy to each wave, thus perpetuating it. As life is experienced, over time these wakes get stronger and stronger.*  \n   \n*Now the purpose of awakening is to look upon our reflection. In life we get glimpses when the wakes all cancel each other out or we obtain those effortless moments of being (work, sports, meditation, etc.), but ultimately we can only purely see ourselves when we remove the stones and stop the wake. Meditation, this awakening path is this process of inner looking to detach ourselves from these wakes, to remove these attachments of conditioning/beleifs/concepts- or simply put remove what we are not/is unoriginal to us leaving the pure and divine eternal self to not only view itself within itself- but to interact with this world and live life from the experiential knowing/understanding of our true position. Effortless, peace-filled, playful, genuine, loving and free.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I did a [guided meditation](https://youtu.be/n2eSjATwLiA?t=3) on these initial steps in the grand journey of awakening and will continue to do so. If my words invoked something within you definitely check it/them out. I do these guided meditations Sunday mornings in order to help others quicken up their own process of awakening, build a larger/global spiritual community based on action (via form of group meditation), and to provide opportunities for those who don't have the understanding yet- all in order to help uplift this world as whenever each one of us awakens to the true and lives in truth, we naturally uplift the greater whole due to our shared origins and power of manifestation/creation.   \n\n\nI hope you all have a great day!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 49001, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Path of Awakening- A Journey Inwards Towards Liberation", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565027891, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/clzc6p/the_path_of_awakening_a_journey_inwards_towards/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Oceanboi97", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3sm6y8gk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564940457, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/clz4nm/do_we_need_social_connections/", "gildings": {}, "id": "clz4nm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 34, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/clz4nm/do_we_need_social_connections/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564940458, "score": 41, "selftext": "If true happiness comes from within, including the happiness others bring us through are perception, does that mean we could be happy alone with zero social life, no friends, family or lover?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48997, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do we need social connections?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565026845, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/clz4nm/do_we_need_social_connections/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ploxxyght", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4a6zzyk4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564935963, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cly7s0/weird_dream/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cly7s0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cly7s0/weird_dream/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564935965, "score": 6, "selftext": "I had this dream the other night about a guy I have never seen or met.

Then he can follow the rules and regulations enjoined in the Vedic literature. By following the regulative principles of human life, one gradually raises himself to the platform of spiritual realization. If one is so fortunate, by such practice, to rise to the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then success is guaranteed for him. In the Vedic literature, the ways of action and reaction are prescribed to enable one to come to the stage of purification. The whole method is based on giving up lust, greed and anger. By cultivating knowledge of this process, one can be elevated to the highest position of self-realization; this self-realization is perfected in devotional service. In that devotional service, the liberation of the conditioned soul is guaranteed. Therefore, according to the Vedic system, there are instituted the four orders of life and the four statuses of life, called the caste system and the spiritual order system. There are different rules and regulations for different castes or divisions of society, and if a person is able to follow them, he will be automatically raised to the highest platform of spiritual realization. Then he can have liberation without a doubt.\"  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 16.22, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n Related Pic : [https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/clx0ag/qa\\_verse\\_no1622/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/clx0ag/qa_verse_no1622/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48967, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "QA : Verse no.16.22", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565015973, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/clx0gy/qa_verse_no1622/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "sleepyafafaf", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4873ohrk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564928541, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/clwtwe/anyone_uses_the_sedona_method/", "gildings": {}, "id": "clwtwe", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/clwtwe/anyone_uses_the_sedona_method/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564928542, "score": 2, "selftext": "I've been trying that method with not much luck.

acts according to his own whims attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme destination.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nAs described before, the \u015b\u0101stra-vidhim, or the direction of the \u015b\u0101stra, is given to the different castes and orders of human society. Everyone is expected to follow these rules and regulations. If one does not follow them and acts whimsically according to his lust, greed and desire, then he never will be perfect in his life. In other words, a man may theoretically know all these things, but if he does not apply them in his own life, then he is to be known as the lowest of mankind. In the human form of life, a living entity is expected to be sane and to follow the regulations given for elevating his life to the highest platform, but if he does not follow them, then he degrades himself. But even if he follows the rules and regulations and moral principles and ultimately does not come to the stage of understanding the Supreme Lord, then all his knowledge becomes spoiled. Therefore one should gradually raise himself to the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service; it is then and there that he can attain the highest perfectional stage, not otherwise.\n\nThe word k\u0101ma-c\u0101rata\u1e25 is very significant. A person who knowingly violates the rules acts in lust. He knows that this is forbidden, still he acts. This is called acting whimsically. He knows that this should be done, but still he does not do it; therefore he is called whimsical. Such persons are destined to be condemned by the Supreme Lord. Such persons cannot have the perfection which is meant for the human life. The human life is especially meant for purifying one's existence, and one who does not follow the rules and regulations cannot purify himself, nor can he attain the real stage of happiness. \n\n**Question 1 : Why the word k\u0101ma-c\u0101rata\u1e25 is very significant with reference to the verse ?**\n\n**Question 2 : Fill in the blanks : In the human form of life, a living entity is expected to be sane and to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ given for elevating his life to the \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, but if he \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ follow them, then he \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/23](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/23)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48913, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 16.23", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564995884, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/clucwe/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1623/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lll-_-l", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3u0gm7un", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564904001, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cltr2e/any_other_otherworldlies_out_there/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cltr2e", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cltr2e/any_other_otherworldlies_out_there/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564904002, "score": 1, "selftext": "I really get turned off by worldly people...(which is a lot out there in this world)...", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48905, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Any other otherworldlies out there?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564990378, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cltr2e/any_other_otherworldlies_out_there/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Arbie456", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kf8dsx1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564903239, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cltnz9/aliens/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cltnz9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cltnz9/aliens/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564903240, "score": 10, "selftext": "What do y\u2019all think about aliens?

The last time I went there was a man working with the lady. My friend asked about an item and we began a conversation, although the conversation builded into much more than small talk. We talked about reincarnation, past lives, tarot cards, intuition, and drugs for easily an hour. Everyone got pretty personal, especially since we were all strangers. \n\nI didn\u2019t say much, because I\u2019d rather listen then talk. Eventually someone came into the store and the conversation naturally died. My friends said goodbye because they already checked out, but I still had to purchase my crystals. After checking out the man that usually doesn\u2019t work there told me something along the lines of that I need to keep doing what I was doing and there was something special about me and to not forget that. He made an effort for it to be discreet and it was quick. \n\nAlthough it was very kind it completely threw me off. What did he mean? Why did he tell me this? What does he know that I don\u2019t? Was this some sort of con to get me to buy more things? I guess I just thought it was just a little odd, because I\u2019m not that spiritual. My friends I was with are much more into it.

I was lead to this path and have found great beauty and truth in what I\u2019m doing and discovering within myself.\n\nHowever, at times I am really affected by the central dogma of this group. I am very comfortable with personalism and understand that it is perfect for my nature. However I am still interested in impersonalism and revere it equally, despite it not being my path. I feel deeply that everybody is on their own path and that there is no one \u201cright\u201d path, but that isn\u2019t widely agreed with in my community. Or any any religious communities, really, it seems. \n\nI love Krishna and Bhakti yoga is beautiful, but the dogma bothers me, especially because I don\u2019t feel especially comfortable or responsible inviting others to be a part of a group that I know is oddly strict on what one can do and what one cannot do. And preaching/recruiting is a rather large part of this community. \nThe regulative principles make sense, but when it turns into \u201cdon\u2019t read texts outside of this one sect\u201d or \u201cno one else can get back to God except for this particular group\u201d I just can\u2019t shake the discomfort. \n\nAny tips on how to deal with this?

I\u2019ve met someone who lives in another country and the connection is magnetic. We are both in relationships but we communicate Daily. Would I like to pursue her? Absolutely and we trade texts, pics, including pics of her two girls and voice messages like a couple does. Since she\u2019s 5 hours ahead I get wake up texts daily and today it was a pic of her and her little girl. We are both convinced we\u2019ve been in each other\u2019s lives before. \n\n\nI have to add that we NEVER discuss our current significant others. it just never becomes part of our conversations in any way.  \n\n\nHowever, I believe we both may have some More karma clearing to get through before this can be considered. I have told her I am attracted to her through and through and she said she feels the same way but I feel at times this is purely energetic on her part and not romantic. she doesn\u2019t stop or get uncomfortable with my slightly sweet and romantic notes here and there. So while I\u2019d like this to proceed into a full unification of our energies occupying the same space, I have to temper my expectations and THAT is my internal work.

I attended a fundamental church and school from pre school until I graduated high school. I remember being sent home from kindergarten one winter because I wore a snowsuit to school. I was told pants are made for boys, so they hid me away from the other children until my parents showed up. If a girl fell down, a boy would not help her up because they were afraid to get in trouble for touching someone of the opposite gender. It was very normal to be  screamed at by authority figures about the wrath of God towards the disobedient. I was asleep in the car once and my dad couldn\u2019t wake me up, so he pulled me out of the car by my hair... the pastor said it was my fault. \n\nMy parents spent most of their budget on my tuition so I was regularly hungry and wore old clothes. I was taught that my main purpose in life was to get married, have kids, and always be obedient to my husband. Any type of self expression was not allowed. Individualism was unheard of. I began feeling very depressed from about 8 years old and on. I couldn\u2019t tell anyone how I felt because I was always told how I was miserable because my faith was weak. Eventually at age 16, I had a breakdown and stayed in a mental hospital for about a week. My friends wouldn\u2019t talk to me until I was \u201cnormal\u201d again. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t even scratch the surface of the things I had to go through. I\u2019ve changed many of my beliefs since I turned 18 but still consider myself spiritual. I moved out of the area I grew up in because it hurt my soul to be there any longer.

I\u2019m surprised that you aren\u2019t required to have a PhD to learn about brainwave entrainment, because honestly, it feels that complicated sometimes and I\u2019m one person who knows how to do this right.\n\nSo instead of giving you another complex definition of this, with theta and gamma states, I\u2019ll ask you a basic question.\n\n#### HAVE YOU EVER HAD MOMENTS IN YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU FELT LIKE YOU \u201cATTRACTED\u201d GOOD LUCK?\n\nYou know what I\u2019m talking about? You walk down the street and you feel people love you. They smile at you, nod at you and you feel connected to those around you.\n\nYou go to work and your boss is actually agreeable and amazing to work with. If only he\u2019d be like this each day, you\u2019d love your job. You meet with your friends and they\u2019re so kind and friendly and you feel so supported.\n\nOr maybe you even attract some amazing things in your life. You end up meeting an amazing person who becomes your significant other. Or some large sum of money comes from nowhere and you have no idea how this happened.\n\n**Did this ever happened to you?**\n\nChances are that it did.\n\nIt happened to all of us. We all have rare moments when everything seems to just work fine. In those moments, the universe falls into order and you get exactly what you want.\n\nAfter so many good things happened to you, you end up scratching your head and you ask yourself two questions\u2026\n\n\u201cHow the hell all of this happened after everything in my life was a frustrating mess for so long?\u201d\n\nAnd\u2026\n\n**\u201cHow can I make this happen again?\u201d**\n\nThe answer to both questions is simple. You were operating on a higher vibration level. You were in sync with the world around you and because of this; you were attracting all that\u2019s good and joyful.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing random. Maybe you, as a person, you looked and acted exactly the same. But your energy, the rate at which the particles your body vibrated were very different. They were at an optimal rate and because of this, instead of encountering frustration and pain and loss as we usually do, you attracted love and wealth and success.\n\nIt\u2019s as simple as that.\n\nCall it however you want, but when you\u2019re on a low frequency, you are disconnected by those around you. You are disconnected to your world. You\u2019re like a piece of an engine that is not fit anymore. It causes friction. It hurts more than it helps.\n\nWhen you\u2019re on a high vibration, high frequency, you\u2019re like a well tuned, well-maintained engine and everything comes to you effortless. Life works. And yes, maybe modern science can\u2019t explain this but it\u2019s true because we are all experiencing it.\n\nEveryone from average people to CEOs experienced periods in their life where everything fell in place where they attracted everything they ever wanted. And just like you, they\u2019ve asked themselves how the heck all of this happened and what they could do for this to happen again.\n\n#### SO WHERE DOES BRAINWAVE ENTRAINMENT COMES INTO PLAY?\n\nIt\u2019s a tool.\n\nIt\u2019s a tool we\u2019re so lucky to know about because it allows your brain to adapt and operate on that higher vibration level. Brainwave syncing are for the human brain what a Formula 1 pit crew is for a high-performance car.\n\nIt takes even the worse out of sync brain, the one that\u2019s operating on a very low frequency and constantly attracts pain and suffering and makes it work. It brings focus and energy and passion and increases the vibration of the user to the level where his life changes completely.\n\nIt\u2019s so effective that some people call it \u201csmart drugs for the brains\u201d or \u201cthe best self-development tool that was ever created\u201d. And I believe they\u2019re right. I have noticed better results by using brainwave entrainment than anything else. Better than reading, better than journaling, better than meditation, even better than paying high priced energy healers.\n\nThis is how brainwave entrainment helps you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[LEARN TO MAKE EVERY DAY YOUR PERFECT DAY BY RAISING YOUR VIBRATION!](https://unseenzone.com/how-to-manifest-anything-you-want-in-your-life/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48782, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "HOW TO MANIFEST YOUR DREAMS, RELATIONSHIP, MONEY AND BASICALLY ANYTHING YOU WANT IN YOUR LIFE, BY RAISING YOUR VIBRATION", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564935906, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/clkmfd/how_to_manifest_your_dreams_relationship_money/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "jocyyoung", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_44hxas2h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564849058, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/clkj6e/some_thoughts_opinions_or_words_of_encouragement/", "gildings": {}, "id": "clkj6e", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/clkj6e/some_thoughts_opinions_or_words_of_encouragement/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564849060, "score": 3, "selftext": "I just dont understand my purpose.

Edward is the flavor of energy that is radiated from life vibrating through this particular body and the words that come out are filtered through this body-mind's accumulated life experience and understanding.  But inwardly I experience myself as an unfiltered, pristine Awareness and Presence.    \n\nI used to be \"Edward\".  Or rather I identified with all the personal events that happened to Edward, the wounds he held onto and the self-conceptions he maintained as his personal identity.  What he thought he was.   When I became aware of how self-identity functions within myself, that was the nail in the coffin for Edward.   Am I \"what I think I am\", OR, am I what I am?   As the great mystic Pop-Eye once said: \"I yams what I yams\".   \n\nThe vibrational material of the Body and the understanding of the Mind follow the self-identification.  If one identifies as being an accumulated history of events, one acts and relates from that place.   If one identifies as a Present Awareness, one acts and relates from that place.  The inertial habits and vibrations of the body-mind lag behind the transformation of self-identity, but it is inevitable that they follow.  The body-mind is like a rock in a rock tumbler:   The course edges are smoothed out and the glossy glow is brought forward.   \n\nThe body-mind is a Culture Processor.  It's whole function is to absorb the patterns of behavior and understanding surrounding it and to relate through that.  That was in part how the idea of Edward came to be in this body-mind.   People pointed at \"me\" and called me \"Edward\" and related to me through what they saw.  I, not knowing myself, integrated those perceptions and added my own mistaken self-perceptions on top of it.    \n\nThe Lattice is the interconnected network of energy and consciousness that exists between conscious beings.    \n\nI have a relationship with each person that comes into my awareness.  Between us, there is how I perceive them and how they perceive me.  That channel can be \"open\", free and clear to be filled with happiness, or it can be laden with misunderstanding and projection from one side or another.  And sometimes that channel can feel like the Being on the other side of that channel is \"foreign\" or \"alien\", that their way of processing and moving through the world is very different.  \n\nFrom this description of nodes and connections between nodes in the lattice, we can intuit a measure of distance between nodes.  When two nodes in the mutual perception of each other experience no interference in the clarity of their channel, there is 0 distance between them.  The resonant frequencies over that channel, between the two nodes, are compatible with the vibrational matrix on either end of the channel.  As we add in static and noise that may be occurring on either end of the channel, the clarity of the channel degrades and distance increases.   Further add in projection and misperception, and the distance increases even more.    \n\nAbout 10 years ago I intuited a meeting format that I call an Awareness Meeting.  There are 3 stages that a meeting facilitator transitions the meeting through:    \n\nStage 1: Emptying Through Sitting In Silence.   \n\nThe goal here for each person is to shed the noise in their own vibrational matrix.  The facilitator speaks to the intention of this phase, to leave the outside world at the boundary of the space in the meeting.  To become present to the room, the background vibration.  And to release any tension in the body and mind to the best one is able to. After speaking to the intent of the phase, the group sits in silence for some time, shedding the noise.    \n\nStage 2: Emptying Through Speaking.\n\nThis is a talking stick format.  One person speaks while others actively listen.  The purpose of stage 2 is not an emergent dialogue, but to speak about any tensions that remain.  By speaking about them we can weaken their grip and maybe achieve release of those tensions.  The other participants remain present, listening, relaxing and releasing.  There is a way of speaking about things that releases them and allows one to sink further into the empty Presence.    \n\nStage 3: Clearing The Channels.  \n\nDuring this stage, each person takes a turn in which they turn to each of the present participants and talk about how they experience their relationship with the other. There's a process of connecting with each person and a way of talking about the experience that must be cultivated so that it is more about processing and clearing than projective. This phase is about clearing the channel, not filling it with more noise.   \n\nAs you can imagine, this third phase can be a wild ride depending on who is present and what kind of static is coming up for clearing between the participants.    \n\nBut this is who I am and what I want.   I am a Conscious Node in the Lattice.  I want to be a part of a Conscious Network of Nodes who want to help each other anchor that Consciousness into the Lattice.  What that would look like is a network of nodes that work towards zero distance between each other and who work to integrate other nodes into experiencing zero distance between each other.     \n\nThis writing is a call out into the Lattice for others who resonate with this description and want to create a non-local Intentional Community of Conscious Nodes that experience zero distance between each other.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48748, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Call To Create A Conscious Lattice", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564917569, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/clhokj/the_call_to_create_a_conscious_lattice/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AnnieTsukino", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ybf80", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564822999, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/clgqxm/spiritual_lifestyle/", "gildings": {}, "id": "clgqxm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/clgqxm/spiritual_lifestyle/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564823000, "score": 2, "selftext": "Are you only surrounding yourself around \u201cspiritual\u201d things? \nThings that make you grow, heal and learn like books, gurus on youtube, journaling, yoga, meditation, creativity, nature, shadow work, healing and so on? \nCompletely in the \u201cnow\u201d?

The more a person is freed from lust, anger and greed, the more his existence becomes pure. Then he can follow the rules and regulations enjoined in the Vedic literature. By following the regulative principles of human life, one gradually raises himself to the platform of spiritual realization. If one is so fortunate, by such practice, to rise to the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then success is guaranteed for him. In the Vedic literature, the ways of action and reaction are prescribed to enable one to come to the stage of purification. The whole method is based on giving up lust, greed and anger. By cultivating knowledge of this process, one can be elevated to the highest position of self-realization; this self-realization is perfected in devotional service. In that devotional service, the liberation of the conditioned soul is guaranteed. Therefore, according to the Vedic system, there are instituted the four orders of life and the four statuses of life, called the caste system and the spiritual order system. There are different rules and regulations for different castes or divisions of society, and if a person is able to follow them, he will be automatically raised to the highest platform of spiritual realization. Then he can have liberation without a doubt.\n\n**Question 1 : How one can raise oneself to the highest platform of spiritual realization ?**\n\n**Related Pic :** [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/22](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/22)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48743, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 16.22", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564907338, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/clgivs/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1622/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bastavar", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1s280jym", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564819302, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/clgbyq/varanasi_a_chaotic_city_on_the_banks_of_river/", "gildings": {}, "id": "clgbyq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/clgbyq/varanasi_a_chaotic_city_on_the_banks_of_river/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "BiJd0M1Hdqj82fNCH4zhkMQz8LN7h03j3x3PlA4jWu0", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/k8zfo0RZ7391TKcbRCf3W6nPJfhbBvfBaZ78krMp1wM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25cb0d22e989123e83081a8d1c73cf27a80498f4", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/k8zfo0RZ7391TKcbRCf3W6nPJfhbBvfBaZ78krMp1wM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cb3aa507fb14c971bdca2d9021c55cc98b12209", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/k8zfo0RZ7391TKcbRCf3W6nPJfhbBvfBaZ78krMp1wM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b4c014ccb36830f4ee1bc2d292dc45223c740ba", "width": 320}, {"height": 480, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/k8zfo0RZ7391TKcbRCf3W6nPJfhbBvfBaZ78krMp1wM.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2cd2581263f01f893cfdb75413d08545cffe739", "width": 640}, {"height": 720, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/k8zfo0RZ7391TKcbRCf3W6nPJfhbBvfBaZ78krMp1wM.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da174ed2e257ee21deacc756c270d691ad6c2924", "width": 960}, {"height": 810, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/k8zfo0RZ7391TKcbRCf3W6nPJfhbBvfBaZ78krMp1wM.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56cf6e98ce1e663d3d503ddb6dbadafa1361619e", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 900, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/k8zfo0RZ7391TKcbRCf3W6nPJfhbBvfBaZ78krMp1wM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=c4ecec55120947c9ba01e2eb81c5022cb476feaf", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1564819304, "score": 3, "selftext": "Is it spirituality or just survival, or may be both?

It was so vivid it may pass as lucid dreaming. Before I tell you the story of what happened in my dream, let me give you a little backstory of how I think what happened in real life is somewhat related to what I dreamt about, just to give you a little context. I just got back from a vacation in Bali, had a summer fling with a Dutch girl and as short as it could get, I had the best week of my life. Now that I'm back in my hometown, I feel that I haven't been feeling 'present' lately. My mind is always looking back from that moment and I just couldn't move on. I had been thinking a lot about the Dutch girl I had a fling with. I was very sad the past 3 days because I wasn't satisfied with living in the present moment; in the now. I fell asleep in a sad mental state.\n\nNow here's the dream. It was very, very disturbing for me I couldn't even wake up to thank myself that it was all just a dream. It felt real; the feeling like being on an astral projection or some sort of spiritual messenger was telling me something. The dream went like this, and it was connected to what I did the previous night.\n\nLast night I hung out with 2 of my friends for drinks. I was pretty sad so I needed some company. I went to a club. Had some drinks then, later on, we all decided to go somewhere, to travel somewhere else maybe. We decided to book a hotel. We went there and we noticed that everyone was wearing white clothing. *I am getting goosebumps as I am typing this.* There was an old woman at the reception. I assume she was the caretaker, asking us how our day went. She then offers us to check into this room. We did. Part of being in somewhere foreign is to observe who you are with and to check the people out, so I could get to know them. I noticed that these people were like robots, like they've been there for a very long time. They didn't show any emotion at all. They felt lifeless, no soul and no form of value. They were reiterating that the place is good and that we should extend longer. As we felt that we were getting bored with the place, we decided to check out. The old lady goes on about why we should extend further because the best is yet to come. I told her, no we really need to go. She then says that there is this one room that we haven't gone yet. If we go in, you might think twice about ever leaving again. My friend, who apparently is the adventurous type of the group, decided to give it a try in hopes of giving the place the benefit of the doubt. When he entered, it seems that everyone in the hotel were celebrating. Like they were liberated. I then deduced that if someone enters the room, you can never go out ever again. And so I made an effort to get him out, in all amends possible. In my attempt to convince the old lady to let him out, everyone in the hotel showed sinister behavior. It was really scary that I decided to just leave my friend. I saw an elevator and decided to go on the ground floor, to find the exit I figured. When the doors opened, I was back at the reception and I saw the old lady again. She says that there is no turning back unless she gives her approval. I then panicked and decided to keep running away the same way, to the elevator and back. Now it felt like I was in a loop. She was then laughing in a sinister manner telling me that there is no way out. I could hear my friend screaming in agony from the room he was in. I then questioned myself that there must be a way to get out of this place, what else could I do than to use force? I resorted to using brute force and that's when shit just got real. When I pushed all the people aside who were blocking my way, their faces changed--like melted faces that seemed like they were in agony and in pain. They kept telling me that there was no way out, no way out, you will forever be here. After numerous attempts in the elevator, I managed to get out into the parking lot. The old lady found me and she kinda made a spell to bring me back into the hotel. In the parking lot, I found books. *I love reading.* I found my video game console. *I enjoy video games*. I found life... at the parking lot. But then the old lady said that she will rip apart the books I am holding. I was hiding under a car but she managed to find me with my dearly held books. When she found me she asked me which book I am holding would she rip apart. Before I could even answer she ripped everything, and then she brought me back inside the hotel. I couldn't even stay there for another night in fear of not being able to get back *alive*.\n\nThen I woke up. I felt so lifeless. I begin to think that this was a message of some sort from my subconscious. I'm trying to connect this with the backstory I just mentioned before the dream. I think I was too hung up on my past (the vacation) that I forgot how to live and appreciate the present. I forgot what it means to be spiritual after that trip because I only longed for pleasure and satisfaction from material things. My favorite pastimes always include the expression of my Self and how much I appreciate being alive. I didn't appreciate life after that vacation. I thought the best pleasure and enjoyment I could have was only through that trip. Through this dream, I figured my previous judgment was wrong. There are so much better things about the Now despite how I feel about today's mediocrity. The past was the past. Good things happened in the past. There is no point lingering further beyond it, otherwise, I'd be stuck in a loop of being in the past that I forget to live the present. The present moment may not be as good as the vacation I had because of its 'mediocrity', but that's just the way it is. Vacations are meant to be a form of 'special' experience with the self and with others. It is not an escape from the confines of reality and the conditions I am living in. \n\nI guess that was the message I got from my subconscious, Higher Self. Now, I feel thankful for this dream despite how vividly horrifying it was. It was the message I needed to get from my Higher Self. There are so much better things in life that there is no point but to let the past be the way it is. The past is just a means to develop a better you, and how you can be a better person for others. \n\nNotes: I am not a religious person, but I consider myself a very spiritual person.

We went to trial and fought for the right to love each other, set legal precedent to protect the rights of LGBTQ students nationwide, lost our basketball scholarships, lost our families. I even lost my father who suddenly passed during the litigation. When we fell in love, it was intense. It was passionate. It was everything I had ever dreamed of with a guy, but it just so happened to be my first relationship with a girl. I am very intuitive. I feel energy, negative and positive in the most intense ways. I know FOR FACT that going through the court system for 4 years cast a lot of negative energy on us, into our relationship. We essentially took down a university, not by our own intention but by the way the law played out. Slowly, our emotional connection and passion became lost in the legal battle. The school put our entire personal lives and childhood on trial, even tested our relationship to a point many couples would have given up.  I remember watching the staff members of the Christian school hold hands in a prayer circle outside of the court room, praying to win the case, praying for the jury to see them with compassion.\n\nWe never prayed. We had given up on god at that point.\n\nWe love each other more than anything in the world, but things are not the same anymore. I truly believe she is my soul mate, but I have come to accept that it takes more and more energy everyday to get through the day without a fight.. \n\nThough it will take hundreds and hundreds of people, I believe we can heal.\n\nI believe in the power of prayer, in the power of energy, and the power of love.\n\nI believe this does not have to be our ending. I will not give up on us until I know I have exhausted all of my efforts to save us.\n\nI ask you, to take 30 seconds of your time, even 10, maybe 5 if you can spare:\n\nPlease send love and healing to the couple who lost their basketball scholarships to love each other, so that they can find the strength to rekindle the love that brought them together in the first place.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48688, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Would You Believe Me If I Told You", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564884308, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cld999/would_you_believe_me_if_i_told_you/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Expert_Entrepreneur", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_30etpuqm", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564793516, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/clci3a/best_herbs_to_use_to_get_into_a_deep_state_of/", "gildings": {}, "id": "clci3a", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/clci3a/best_herbs_to_use_to_get_into_a_deep_state_of/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564793517, "score": 2, "selftext": "I know full spectrum CBD helps me somewhat but I just wanted to hear what other herbs you have used?

I do not pay rent but in exchange I take care of the house and yard as my parents are out of the country for another 4 years.(our last renter trashed the house) \\[We are American but they work overseas\\]. I am about to start my last semester of university. My sister just graduated from University in Canada. She has always been unstable (destroying parents bathroom in fits of rage as kids, lying all the time about things she did and blaming them on me, arguing with my older sister in screaming fits from 5 Am until school and when we come home, walking all over my parents, etc.) These things have been in her behaviour her entire life, and we always tried to get her to therapy but she refused and would get more toxic if you mentioned it.\n\nThe complicated twist here is that she went to the same university I am at for 1 semester and then dropped out when I was in highschool and came to live with us and work at Chik-fil-A for 6 months to then go to school in Canada (she hates America) even though my parents had 0 funds for college in the first place and my oldest sister had to be a national merit scholar to afford college and I had to take out loans(parents also took out loans to help me out but I got lots of grants/scholarships and my own private loans both unsub/sub). Parents took out largely disproportionate loans to send her to school in Canada and pay her $1000 a month rent that nobody can afford. Before this, however, she went on a skiing trip in Maryland and on the last run of the day went down a black diamond because of peer pressure. They found her 5 hours after the resort had closed unconscious dying with a broken back and shattered bones. She had skiid at that point 2 times in her life and was at best a green diamond skiier. (beginner of beginners) she had dropped 14 feet of the side of the run and landed directly on rocks. She was choppered out to the ICU in maryland and was there for like 2-3 months before it was safe for her to travel. By some miracle she did not die and is not paraplegic, but has 2 metal vertebrae, a limp from atrophied calf muscles, multiple eating disorders that she already had before this, she has neurological impairment where she can barely tell when it is time to go to the bathroom and has to wear adult diapers. She cannot feel sexual pleasure. She had to take another year off from school to recover and since that time life got so hard for my already toxic/emotionally abusive but loving family. I have never been very present with my family, just my dad because I had undiagnosed(now diagnosed) autism/add/ocd since my parents didnt beleive in mental health and treated their kids as an extension of their ego (i mean this factually not as blame). I played soccer or spent time in my room due to the toxic environment my whole life.\n\nSo, the problem. Ever since her accident her emotional abuse of our family and toxic behaviour has gotten absolutely uncontrollable. As you can see, it is hard to blame her.  as she just graduated and her student visa ends and she is looking for remote jobs, my parents said she can come stay in the house with me for a month before they fly her back and continue paying for her rent. Last time she was here for christmas break I ended up not being able to deal with it as much as I tried because it was making all day everyday horrible and draining. I told her I was not currently comfortable being her brother and locked my bedroom door and didnt say anything. I recorded video/audio of her threatening to destroy my (parents') bathroom, saying all the same stuff my parents did whenever we locked a door or expressed the basic human need for privacy as children. She also then called my parents and started lying as much as she possibly could saying horribly nasty and hurtful things  until I sent them the video and she realized she got caught. She left that trip by telling me I need to be saved like her by jesus so I can too never be wrong like her ( she got scarily religious understandably after the accident) She apologized since then (6 months) and she is a good person fundamentally. However if you are good 11% of the time and absolutely awful the 88%, this is a losing situation for me. It is day 2 and I have already allowed her to bring me down as she monopolizes the environment, is ridiculously dirty, has already eaten my food and lied about it even though our parents give her grocery money, and generally abusive toxic behaivour due to her emotional pain. I would say I can't imagine the stress, but I very much can. I am autistic who grew up in a verbally/emotionally abusive household with insecure parents. I want to have the strength to handle it and be a positive influence, but an unfortunate quirk of an autistic brain is the inability to get past negative envrionmental stressors. You become stuck on ideas. I know the short term path forward is to just suck it up for a month unti she goes back to canada unemployed with my parents paying ridiculous montreal rent and living expenses (my dad had to get a job in iraq just to afford it all and get out of medical and student loan debt.) \n\nShe takes advantage of a loving familial relationship and bets on our inability to put her out on the street to learn about the real world because of her ridiculously unfair and difficult life so far. She's only 24 and had a ridiculously hard time, but I cant help but shake that she created this reality by being so toxic far before the accident. The accident is just a horribly self-imposed reason to continue the behaviour and take advantage of my family long term. I dont know what to do but I cannot keep interacting with her, she is nice and then immediately will monopolize an environement and emotionally turn it into a cesspool of vindictive hate and abuse. I really need help please I don't want to be whiny or entitled, but my compassion only gets me as far as understanding.

They guilt me by saying they're going to get sick and die because of me if I ever try to run from their cultural norms and traditions and that I will regret running away, end up homeless, etc. I'm aware that I must leave, but in the meantime while i'm with them, how am I supposed to cope? I read all this spiritual stuff and LOA and Neville and whatever, but I just can't with these people. Their energy sucks the life out of me. \n\nI constantly have anxiety and guilt when I think about my escape and how it'll tear them apart. Life is just so complicated and the pressure is REAL when I read that I may be the one causing this since everyone is me pushed out and my vibrations are just low and negative. I can't help it. I try not to over think my situation and obsess over my escape and misfortunes and whatever but I have constant thoughts about it, the day I'll escape, how I'll do it, what am I going to tell my family if I get caught, etc. I disappoint myself so much when I think about how this is probably all my fault and other times I talk myself out of suicide because it's an easier route than just escaping and carrying guilt and anxiety with me everywhere. \n\nI'm not sure if this is the right place, but I'll try it out and others. I don't even know what i'm asking over here. Advice? What would you do in this situation? Should I stay longer just to try and reason with them, see if it's my fault or should I just get the hell out? Is life ever gonna get better?

Stuck in time \u2013 what an apt way to describe the plight of third density humans living upon 3D earth during this \u201ctime\u201d period. Allow me to elaborate\u2026  \n\nImagine being told at sunrise that you must complete a certain action/set-of-actions prior to, say the sunset, or any other extremely normal, consistently and continuously occurring periodic event. And that if you refused to comply, you won\u2019t be getting any food to eat (or in worse cases, even water to drink) for the day. Can you imagine the tremendous pressure and stress that this could possibly put on your mind? On your body? Or even upon your very soul for that matter?  \n\nCan you imagine how strenuous and challenging it would feel like to experience this pain every single moment of your life? Can you imagine this being your \u201cnormal\u201d way of living? Well, that should give you the general gist of the concept of time.  \n\nYou see, the idea of \u201ctime\u201d comes into play whenever there is a delay between thoughts and their resultant manifestations. In an instantaneous-manifestation based world, whatever you think about becomes your reality then and there. So you continue to do things, create things, and enjoy things nonstop. There are no restrictions, no impediments and absolutely no hindrances whatsoever to get in your way.  \n\nIn a time-space reality on the other hand, there is usually a supermassive gap between what you think about and what occurs as a result of it. So, if you changed your frequency (during this gap) by changing your thoughts either knowingly or unknowingly, well, you can quite literally expect the unexpected.  \n\nThis problem becomes compounded by the fact that most humans at this time-space nexus upon this planet have absolutely no idea that they are all creator Gods in-the-flesh. Those who do, usually lack the necessary knowledge and understandings of how the process of creation realistically works. And even in the case of those who do know how things work \u2013 chances are that they are unable to practice the process unimpeded. Moreover, there are so many minute and elementary details regarding this process that are simply not available to even the most aware and awakened of humans out there. There are no trustworthy sources that one can really rely upon to answer questions in this regard \u2013 which ultimately makes manifesting, and therefore bursting out of the \u201ctime prison\u201d something of a near-impossible ordeal. This is because the more you manifest right, the faster are you able to manifest things. And unless you are able to manifest more and manifest correctly, you are unable to close the gap between thoughts and manifestations. Which results in an absolute inability on your part to manifest things instantaneously. Which then keeps you even further entrapped in \u201ctime\u201d. Which then results in you feeling even more like an utter failure. Which then further dampens your spirits until even the things that you were able to manifest easily earlier become a chore to manifest. Which then further go on to trap you even deeper amidst the quicksand that is the time-space imprisonment/nexus. For just like quicksand \u2013 this situation too worsens the more you try to fight it. And so on and on it goes. Never ever stopping. Never, ever, ever ending. Thus it ultimately ends up becoming both \u2013 a self-perpetuating cycle as well as a self-fulfilling prophecy. One that ends only with the utter destruction and defeat of your sanity, happiness and well-being \u2013 as well as the complete and comprehensive annihilation of your very soul itself. Talk about things going super south, super-quick, eh?  \n\nGiven the fact that life on earth already comes pre-packaged with a ridiculously powerful veil of forgetfulness \u2013 in addition to the fact that survival itself takes away most of our time, energy and other resources \u2013 even the ability to as much as practice manifestation processes seamlessly is but an unreachable dream for even the most awakened of souls around these here parts. As a result, we all continue to be slaves to the imaginary concept of time. Because no practice \u2013 usually equals no perfection.  \n\nThat should be enough for today. I will continue elaborating further upon this topic tomorrow.\n\n\u2013 Aseim  \n\nNote: You could also follow these posts on my blog at: https://gaiatimecapsule.home.blog/", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48596, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Living In Linear Time - Gaia Time Capsule Chapter 1", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564843307, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cl5075/living_in_linear_time_gaia_time_capsule_chapter_1/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Cringingforall", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_z5n11yz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564753439, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cl4art/finding_myself/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cl4art", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cl4art/finding_myself/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564753440, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi everyone, recently I\u2019ve been going through a roller coaster of emotions that have been heavily saturated with anxiety, stress and worry.

I wanted to share my positive story, because I just can\u2019t stop thinking about it. And, I don\u2019t know anyone in my waking life who is interested in meditation and spirituality. This is kind of a long post. \nHere\u2019s a bit of a back story. I was born to two young and criminal adults. Their life revolves around drugs, alcohol, violence and jail time. My father had an older brother who was a respected member of their community, a staff sergeant in the Air Force, with two kids of his own. Inevitably, I was put up for adoption. However, I was taken out of state, across the country by my mother, prior to me being taken into custody, put into foster care, and then up for adoption. My uncle wanted to adopt me. He wanted me to know my true family. But things went south on his end and he ended his life. Fast forward, I was adopted into a terrible situation. Single mother, alcoholic, abusive narcissist. I never felt loved, I didn\u2019t know who my family was until I was 22. I basically went through life feeling unloved, abandoned, and like I would never be happy. \nSomewhat recently I decided to try out a guided meditation. To reach out to my spirit guides for a meeting, or help, or advice. I don\u2019t really know what my motive was here, I just wanted to try and see if anything happened. I came to a point in the meditation where where I saw a pond. In the pond was a boat. And in the boat was my spirit guide. This person was sitting hunched, wearing a big brown coat. I felt unsure to approach this person, as I could not see him. But I found myself in this boat, desperately trying to make out a face of this person. No words were spoken, but I asked \u201cwho are you?\u201d. His face appeared and he smiled at me. A big warm smile. I didn\u2019t know who he was at first until it suddenly just dawned on me. He was my uncle, the one I\u2019ve never met, who had loved me as his own child, and had tried so hard to adopt me, so I would never feel alone in a world where love is becoming so rare. Again, no words were spoken, but I blurted out,\u201d Will I ever be happy?\u201d, and he answered \u201cYES\u201d. I immediately started crying, in this meditation and in real life. His answer had such power behind it, and such a golden truth, it was so true. The scene snapped into a meadow, everything had this golden glow about it. He stood in front of me, and as I though,\u201dwhat\u2019re we doing here?\u201d, two small children ran from behind him, laughing and frolicking in the golden meadow around us. They were his children. I asked \u201cSo, what? Why am I seeing this?\u201d. He smiled his warm smile again, and a 3rd child came running from behind him, laughing and playing with the others. That 3rd child was me. I knew now that even if I have next to nobody here on earth, i am still loved. There\u2019s is someone looking out for me. I do have a family, even if it\u2019s not here in my own home.\nI got validation that day, from that guided mediation I followed, to just see what happens. Out of all the possibilities, different ways this meditation could go, I never expected it to be this. \nIf you made it through this long post, thanks for reading.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48578, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A Meditation to Remember", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564835248, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cl3g3j/a_meditation_to_remember/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "GiftsDiviniti", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_176g33", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564747611, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cl38fy/the_benefits_of_aroma_fragrances_for_your_car/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cl38fy", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cl38fy/the_benefits_of_aroma_fragrances_for_your_car/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564747613, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48576, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Benefits of Aroma Fragrances for Your Car", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564833999, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cl38fy/the_benefits_of_aroma_fragrances_for_your_car/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "throwawaymethinks00", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_36qpu0id", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564747335, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cl36nn/i_feel_pain/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cl36nn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cl36nn/i_feel_pain/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564747337, "score": 4, "selftext": "I met someone a while back. Four months ago. I've had several deja vu moments. We had a nice a steady situationship. We'd talk daily. Been in no communication for the past two weeks. I left him in a very sudden way -i gave him closure and everything. I asked him if i upset him. He didn't reply. \n\nI felt horrid. I didn't regret leaving him but i felt horrid about the pain. I started feeling...strange. Like i could envision my soul looking after him. It'd feel surreal. I'm also an empath, if that's relevant. At first i had a blue soul and it would follow him around. Look after him. Sometimes the blue soul figure would melt into his body or hug him. Then i started focusing that soul thing and began envisioning writing letters and leaving them on his desk. I did this daily. Told him to eat well. Told him i was ok. Told him to not worry about me. Some days i'd envision a pigeon and whisper to it the message i wanted to send then let it fly off. Gosh this sounds like crazy talk. Other days i'd talk to him and comfort him. \n\nYesterday was the first day i didn't reach out to him via that soul figure thing. Day before yesterday my soul turned pink and it was pulling on his soul. I let him know i was leaving for good now. To 'be good, okay?' I doused his whole room in pink and then there was this weird blue thing i started sucking out of his soul and it started coloring my pink soul and i freaked out and opened my eyes. That was the last time. Yesterday he reached out worrying if i was ok. I could feel his pain. Something was different and burdening him but i couldn't JUST ASK BECAUSE I'D SOUND LIKE A CRAZY PERSON. \n\nThe soul figure keeps calling to me even when my eyes are open now. It's coloring the pink soul blue now. But when i envision myself caressing him the blue goes away and it's back to pink. \n\nI feel like i'm going bonkers! Surely this is all in my head, right??? But his pain feels so real.

Otherwise, the being only nourishes the definitions themselves, and thus gets caught up into their temporal states, rather than remaining one with it\u2019s natural and eternal state as that which remains forever invisible.\n\nTo nourish the invisible side of ourselves is to nourish the eternal side of ourselves, for the invisible side is always present wherever and whenever we are. When we nourish the visible side of ourselves, we feed that which is temporal, not eternal. To do so constantly within a repeating pattern, generates mental vortices which sucks the attention of the being within temporal manifestations of itself, thereby placing the attention of the being upon that which will forever remain unstable. Those temporal manifestations are manifestations in the visible domain, of the constant interactions that exists between the visible and the invisible, in the macro and micro perspectives of the universe. Those interactions generates movement which is a direct manifestation of change for nothing visible can remain the same forever - the visible being forever modified by the invisible!!!\n\nThe same relationship is true in the human side of things as well, for it is true that for a human being, the constant interactions between the visible/sensed and the invisible/unsensed domains, generates the movement which is responsible for the experience of life itself. The constant cycle going from one state (invisible/unsensed) to the other (visible/sensed) and back into the one state (invisible/unsensed) again - repeat ad infinitum -, will generate the movement that is responsible for the vibrations of light/energy itself. For the goal of light/energy is to return to it\u2019s invisible/unsensed state, to which it does cyclically at the rate of the plank unit of time, or at the smallest possible unit of time. At each time it returns to it\u2019s invisible/unsensed state, light/energy releases the light/energy that it carried while on the visible/sensed state, into the invisible/unsensed domain. Through the release of that light/energy within the \u201cinvisible/unsensed domain\u201d, that light/energy instantly dissapears from our 3d space-time continuum, and enters the realm of the invisible/unsensed continuum, so as to \u201cpick\u201d the information found within that realm and bring it back to the visible/sensed continuum. \n\nWithin the invisible realm, the light/energy gets impregnated with wathever information that is to be found at that specific moment within it. The light/energy returns to the visible/sensed domain - after the smallest possible unit of time possible, known as the plank time -, fully charged with what it has brought back from the invisible/unsensed domain. The light/energy releases that charge instantly within the visible/sensed domain, thus releasing the total expressions of the total impressions it has brought back from the invisible/unsensed domain. The invisible/unsensed domain imprints the light/energy with content/information that will be released within the visible/sensed domain at the next plank unit of time, or at the next \u201cflash of light/energy\u201d within the visible/sensed domain. Each time the light/energy flashes it\u2019s contents/informations - coming from the invisible/unsensed domain - within the visible/sensed domain, the visible/sensed domain is updated. After this moment, the light/energy returns back into the invisible/unsensed domain in order to generate the next generation/iteration of the visible/sensed domain for the being to experience. This process is never ending but to resume, the visible/sensed domain is the space where the imprints received from the invisible/unsensed domain, carried within light/energy, are released, while the invisible/unsensed domain is the space where the packets of light/energy are imprinted and charged by the contents/informations found within the invisible/unsensed domain.\n\nThe visible is made true when we perceive ourselves through the senses, which doesn\u2019t specifically equate to our sight. Our senses gives us specific information about specific wavelengts of the light/energy. Those specific wavelengths of the light/energy, gives specific information to those specific areas of the brain which can detect those specific wavelength of the light/energy. For some areas of the brain, those differenciated wavelengths are detected as sight. For others, they are detected as sound, as smell, as taste or as touch. The common denominator within them all, is that they are all different interpretations of the same light/energy. A light/energy which exists, forever in a constant relationship with the invisible.\n\nIt is at the moment where the invisible meets the visible side of things, that the present is made true. The Now is the constant manifestation of this process throughout eternity. It is only in the Now that the invisible side of things comes into direct contact with the visible side of things, for it is only in the forever changing Now, that the invisible is made true.\n\nWhat a being seeks, is to reunite itself with the invisible side of things, for the eternal being EXISTS within the invisible side of things, not the visible. This is demonstrated through the simple fact that the one who is doing the thinking remains forever invisible - the \u201cvisible being\u201d, being only temporal manifestations of the \u201cinvisible being\u201d. The invisible, in and as itself, can never be demonstrated, for as soon as it is, it\u2019s essence changes into something new. Every new other things will forever come and replace every demonstrations of the invisible as a thing, thus rendering every demonstrations of the invisible as a thing to be forever false witnesses of the invisible as no thing.\n\nThe only true witness of the invisible is the invisible itself in action. And that invisible is the subjective side of a being.\n\nTo seek ourselves into the visible, is to seek the source of ourselves within what we are not. We are not the visible, for the visible is a temporal manifestation of the intemporal being that we seek, and is thus not the being that we are. That being is the eternal being of which we are truly and forever one with - we are forever one with it for we are forever one with the invisible side of things -, for we are the invisible being which forever processes the visible into something new. The being that we seek exists as the invisible side of a being, and the invisible side exists as the inner subjectivity of a being. However, the paradox is that the invisible side of a being is and cannot be limited or expressed through words for what it truly is, and therefore, cannot truly be expressed through words, for as soon as it is, it loses it\u2019s attribute of invisibility, thus it loses it\u2019s true nature/meaning as it is expressed. A word or a series of words can only point into the direction where the invisible exists within a being, but can never portray what the invisible is in and of itself.\n\nWe process the visible through us constantly changing it within the invisible side of ourselves. For it is within our invisible side that the processes of evolution, or the processes of change through transformations, occurs. These transformations are absolutely necessary, for the invisible is absolutely necessary, and for the invisible to be forever true, change has to be forever true. If change was somewhere, somewhat not true, then it wouldn\u2019t even be possible to entertain any ideas upon existence. We wouldn\u2019t exist. The only way for this absolute necessity to be true, is for the visible to change constantly through a process of evolution/\u201dequilateral additions\u201d that operates in the visible and invisible side of things. Everything changes constantly, but only at different rates. The invisible is the space within a being where the visible transforms itself into something new. It is the invisible space where the invisible creator as ourselves, modify the visible universe by transforming it so as to change, evolve and create the ever changing visible universe that we experience.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48554, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The invisible self", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564823115, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cl1nla/the_invisible_self/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "KeyNoise8", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_43e2y2qk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564736056, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cl1key/tibetan_book_of_the_dead_for_those_curious_about/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cl1key", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cl1key/tibetan_book_of_the_dead_for_those_curious_about/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "De8zJG9GmYvGkCJwglD_0AwlPFoXsIYGDZ6NdnyfYXI", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ArJWmGkzIpm2Rp2nWDcu9yMCT5EzJJ-F5x7BxEw5eO4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7262063559714aacbdf5d71641726176386ec8f", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ArJWmGkzIpm2Rp2nWDcu9yMCT5EzJJ-F5x7BxEw5eO4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ead766fcc6dd1f7a7b132d3beea8d6ccba70b52", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ArJWmGkzIpm2Rp2nWDcu9yMCT5EzJJ-F5x7BxEw5eO4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ffc931bf8888ebd425dbde5c55f3f0336f05a0b", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ArJWmGkzIpm2Rp2nWDcu9yMCT5EzJJ-F5x7BxEw5eO4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=1e6c80f8ea88f4c5efa4f626c61b234c1528d61c", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1564736057, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48553, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Tibetan Book Of The Dead - For those curious about the afterlife", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564822427, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cl1key/tibetan_book_of_the_dead_for_those_curious_about/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "eazywalkers", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_n301psj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564735646, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cl1iiz/keeping_good_company_is_as_important_as_life_it/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cl1iiz", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cl1iiz/keeping_good_company_is_as_important_as_life_it/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564735647, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48553, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Keeping good company is as important as life.

The year before last I was very into it. I had crystals and I used a manifestation journal and I visualized and I learned about spirituality. I\u2019m not sure if this correlates, but December 31st the year before last I did a LOT of bullets in my manifestation journal for the upcoming year. \n\nWell, last year I experienced the hardest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. For at least the first half of the year I was constantly anxious. I was anxious for most of the time, but most intensely anxious in places I\u2019d had problems before. I had trouble sleeping, I couldn\u2019t fall asleep for hours and I feel like sometimes I\u2019d be up all night. There was also some nights that I couldn\u2019t really relax without a nightlight. I felt weirdly disconnected all the time, almost out of my body or like the floor wasn\u2019t even beneath me and that the walls were closing in. I was also often exhausted although feeing anxious a lot, nothing was really on my mind except I felt very heavy. This was mostly in the first halfish of the year and the sleeping problems were only for two months. \n\nDuring this period I started praying and now I\u2019m fairly religious. I\u2019m also happier then I\u2019ve ever been before and I\u2019ve made and am continuing to make lots of great changes in my life and there\u2019s so many blessings and positivity in the future. Before I used to have many family problems and anxiety and an array of other issues, but I\u2019m so much more at peace now as well as healthier physically and mentally. I feel like I got a lot of insight about universe and myself from praying as well. I don\u2019t have my crystals anymore and I stopped doing manifestations and chakra work last year because it was ROUGH. The whole experience was super out of character for me but I\u2019ve often had spiritual experiences in life and I know I was trying to do a lot of spiritual work at the time it happened.

I am trying to be more spiritual but I think that we all have different definitions of what that means so for me it means to be one with myself and the universe. I started eating healthier, started praying, meditating, etc. I try to sit outside with nature more, I work out, etc. I have also let go of things and let the universe handle them. I typically manifest then let go because that's how it works for me. \n\nHere's the thing... my ex and i broke up a seven months ago. It was a mess for me which is what led me down this road to spirituality. After months of crying and trying to figure out why... I took a few steps. I tried to let her go but she was still on my mind 24/7. So, I looked up manifesting a specific person and I began manifesting her. I spoke about her like she was mine because to me she was already mine. I then did some meditation about  her and everything but it felt off. I decided that, that was a sign for me to just have some time to myself and stop thinking about her. \n\nI  let her go. For good. It wasn't half ass like normal. I didn't have any more faith that we were going to find out way back to each other but the past few days she has been on my mind heavily. I feel like maybe something is up with her or with us. It feels calm and I am not anxious about it like usual but it's weird. I manifested her and let her go and it felt wrong like I shouldn't be trying to manifest her. Is it that I hadn't actually let her go? \n\nI have finally talked to God today about it all and I am asking for guidance. My question to y'all is... has this ever happened before? And what was the outcome? I am truly giving this to a higher power but I also can't deny what I have been feeling. We haven't talked or seen each other in months.

How their next birth is decided ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** \"In this verse it is clearly indicated that the placing of a particular individual soul in a particular body is the prerogative of the supreme will. The demoniac person may not agree to accept the supremacy of the Lord, and it is a fact that he may act according to his own whims, but his next birth will depend upon the decision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and not on himself. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Third Canto, it is stated that an individual soul, after his death, is put into the womb of a mother where he gets a particular type of body under the supervision of superior power. Therefore in the material existence we find so many species of life-animals, insects, men, and so on. All are arranged by the superior power. They are not accidental. As for the demoniac, it is clearly said here that they are perpetually put into the wombs of demons, and thus they continue to be envious, the lowest of mankind. Such demoniac species of life are held to be always full of lust, always violent and hateful and always unclean. They are just like so many beasts in a jungle.\"\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 16.19, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/ckph49/qa\\_verse\\_no1619/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/ckph49/qa_verse_no1619/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48384, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "QA : Verse no.16.19", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564757992, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ckphdc/qa_verse_no1619/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Kimi147", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2lq0nwri", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564669965, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ckp599/19_powerful_frequency_tones_at_once_achieve/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ckp599", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ckp599/19_powerful_frequency_tones_at_once_achieve/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "YKHVWKpf_AW2IwwcqwjkvGG9wGfb4gq7NWwv68DjV_U", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/7kC5ssV8C-H2oGrBwc-N0lDj2hnWcylm8cUL_F5s9v4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ac089ec92ef23c38cd1eadb9c3a1b3e4a4f9d65", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/7kC5ssV8C-H2oGrBwc-N0lDj2hnWcylm8cUL_F5s9v4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abcd1647a237757cb405b6cd8d3e80a7bed5345d", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/7kC5ssV8C-H2oGrBwc-N0lDj2hnWcylm8cUL_F5s9v4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46406d5a6a17ca8d22f2515dee424d80a1a726e5", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/7kC5ssV8C-H2oGrBwc-N0lDj2hnWcylm8cUL_F5s9v4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=0e7123a4f17ec0231be2c3a44b944183cafc6ec0", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1564669969, "score": 8, "selftext": "\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj8ulLtLwsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj8ulLtLwsE)\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\nNO HEADPHONES REQUIRED, BUT RECOMMENDED. :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u276f\u276f This 8D AUDIO track features:  \n\n4hZ, 7.83hZ, 10.5hZ, 33hZ, 111hZ, 126.22hZ, 141.27hZ, 144.72hZ, 207.36hZ, 211.44hZ, 222hZ, 256hZ, 512hZ, 528hZ, 555hZ (isochronic tone), 741hZ, 963hZ, 4096hZ, 8192hZ, 8D Audio Movement &amp; Natural 432hZ Tuning.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \n\nBENEFITS AND EFFECTS \n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \n\n\u2588 Various Studies/Researches On Sound Healing, Meditation, Brain Waves and MORE: \n\n\u2588 [pastebin.com/kBnrC4uQ](https://pastebin.com/kBnrC4uQ) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u2713 4hZ \u276f\u276f Enkephalins, Extrasensory perception; Astral Projection, Telepathy, \"Seduction mindset\".

I had a several goals that I was able to reach because I had faith. \n\nMy father has been in prison for the last 16 years and we had suffered financial problems ever since. I was told via dreams in 2013 to reevaluate whether my father is truly innocent like I had been led to believe for a while (I would rather not get into the details). I finally got the courage to separate from him completely in 2017 because his case is a terrorism related one and he was holding me back. My mother was able to get a divorce from him shortly afterwards and we somehow managed to move to a new city and start fresh. \n\nI am an aspiring music producer and I had gotten admission for an audio engineering diploma course in Canada. I was extremely happy about getting in, and after all the other impossible things that had happened I had faith that this would work out too. Unfortunately, my Visa got rejected. I had everything in order and I was still rejected because they thought I would overstay illegally after my Visa would expire. Due to my father's case falling under terrorist law, there is a distinct possibility it went against me but I have no real way of finding out even through the Visa officer's notes.\n\nI've had the last year to reevaluate what I want to do. It was one of the worst years of my life because I got stuck in a depressive cycle I was trying to break out or constantly. Very recently I forced myself to go to therapy and change things. I built a studio in my home and also began learning German. I got into a Master's program in the UK which I have deferred, and I plan to apply to German universities currently to expand my options. \n\nI've realised that as much as I may have healed from the initial shock of having my Visa rejected, I'm afraid I'm struggling in getting that faith back. I have practical options planned out and am trying my best, but I don't know how to trust in the process anymore.

Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of existence.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nIt is known that God is all-merciful, but here we find that God is never merciful to the demoniac. It is clearly stated that the demoniac people, life after life, are put into the wombs of similar demons, and, not achieving the mercy of the Supreme Lord, they go down and down, so that at last they achieve bodies like those of cats, dogs and hogs. It is clearly stated that such demons have practically no chance of receiving the mercy of God at any stage of later life. In the Vedas also it is stated that such persons gradually sink to become dogs and hogs. It may be then argued in this connection that God should not be advertised as all-merciful if He is not merciful to such demons. In answer to this question, in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra we find that the Supreme Lord has no hatred for anyone. The placing of the asuras,the demons, in the lowest status of life is simply another feature of His mercy. Sometimes the asuras are killed by the Supreme Lord, but this killing is also good for them, for in Vedic literature we find that anyone who is killed by the Supreme Lord becomes liberated. There are instances in history of many asuras-R\u0101va\u1e47a, Ka\u1e41sa, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu-to whom the Lord appeared in various incarnations just to kill. Therefore God's mercy is shown to the asuras if they are fortunate enough to be killed by Him.\n\n**Question 1 : Why even killing of asuras by the lord is also good for them ?**\n\n**Question 2 : What is the meaning of the word adham\u0101m ?**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/20](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/20)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48350, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 16.20", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564735345, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cklp4c/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1620/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "NTHBK", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_m9y1ur1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564646652, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cklehd/not_human/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cklehd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 34, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cklehd/not_human/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564646653, "score": 7, "selftext": "Let me clear this up a little. \n\nI don\u2019t identify as human in mind or spirit.

I want to meditate to get all this negative thought out, but I just can\u2019t find the energy to do so, I feel like I\u2019ll be so distracted, I get so distracted and I can\u2019t even focus on my breathing or analysis of my thoughts. Sometimes I feel like it\u2019s working, and sometimes I just feel like giving up. I felt the need to type this here because maybe there would be people that feel the same way or have been here and could give some type of advice or some type of advice on how this mediation stuff actually works. I wanna believe, but I feel like I\u2019m loosing the faith to continue on this spiritual route. I don\u2019t know how to continue, I feel lost. In a void of just nothingness. Like at all. Idk where I want to go with this, but I\u2019d hope that maybe I can receive some type of guidance. All love, thanks if you read this.

I'm not too used to them so, due to my naiveness, I ended up smoking a huge quantity in one hit. Fifteen minutes later, I'm on cloud 9, but I'm trying my best to not purge (as the body was tricking me into purging).\n\nSuddenly, thoughts caught me off-guard. Weed for me has always helped me stay in the moment and calm the mind, but this time I fell for the illusion of thought very very hard. They were trying to convince me that the real self (what some people call the ''higher self'') was thoughts themselves. That the real I was thoughts. I immediately started to feel the anxiety rushing in and I tried to defend myself. I asked myself: ***who is the real I?*** Here's where things started to happen.\n\nI asked myself: ***''who is it that is observing the thoughts?''*** But I realized that the one answering that question would be another thought disguising as the observer. That was a lie, and I realized that.\n\n*I opened my eyes and asked myself:* ***''am I pure awareness?*** ***Let me try and be pure awareness''****, but I also realized that I was focusing on what I was seeing rather than being awareness itself. I closed my eyes and suddenly, I was hit with some very vivid visuals. I visualized a tunnel full of clouds (if I remember correctly). The clouds symbolized thoughts and how they disguise as the real self. They try everything they can to convince you that you are them, but they are just lying. Here's where I realized the first thing:* ***thoughts = ego***\\*. The ego only exists through thought, nowhere else. When you are doing something and you're lost in it (by ''lost'' I mean flowing through the heart and being pure awareness) the ego is nowhere to be found. Well, if you let the clouds just roam by without falling for its illusion, you'll realize who is your real self.\\*\n\n*In my visualization, after the clouds (thoughts) passed, I could clearly see the end of the tunnel: there was a golden statue (similar to the Buddha) shining but between him and ''me'' there were some iron bars (similar to a prison) creating a separation. I asked myself:* ***isn't ''my'' real self that ''higher self'' I am seeing?*** *I opened my eyes and I understood: I've always been ''it'' but I got too lost in thought and its illusion. The ''separation'' is an illusion caused by identifying as thoughts. When I tried to understand, it would slip away but when I didn't try, it would come back.*\n\nHere's what I wrote down in my notes after this all happened:\n\n*''The real you is that awareness that is at the back of the mind. Thoughts are a distraction, pretending to be you. When you try to understand, you won\u2019t understand. When you don\u2019t try, it\u2019s when you understand. If it\u2019s complicated to understand when you\u2019re not trying to understand, it\u2019s because you\u2019re still identifying as thought. Image of the Buddha while all of this happened, perhaps mental connection. Ego = thought. The real self is something very powerful that I can describe as what society has described as God. Thought create the illusion of separation (between the self and the ''higher self'').''*\n\nI would describe this as a 0.0000000001% enlightenment moment. I was so mindblown.

I try to stay social with friends when I can and my concentrating is still focused (luckily), with spending my time playing bass or reading.\n\nI have a pretty good routine that I feel is great for me. Increased number/digit synchronicity also has been apparent and is staying with me, which gives me hope I'm on the right path.\n\nI've been going through a semi rough patch, with housing situation. Having to move back with my parents, not having answers in my work to increased pay, and generally feeling a little impatient with my situation.\n\nHowever I can't help but feel disconnected with my higher being and my intuition isn't on point.\n\nI'm needing some answers to how I can enhance my spirituality?

Keep an open mind, read it, if it knocks a few blocks down of your beliefs, let it, have an open mind, and ask great questions. The answer could be beyond intellect, but I will try to make it as simple as possible. (You might find me answering with what you need to hear than what you want to hear, so keep and open mind.)\n\n\"With grace I want to share a very profound realization I had on 3 days back. I was sitting in a garden, next a fountain, it was partly cloudy and partly sunny. It was the third consistent day that I was in bliss in every moment and I was feeling oneness and love for everything, I was in the moment and no where else and the cause for this bliss was realization of awareness, happiness and peace within. Sitting there, I realized MahaSamadhi (Dissolution into absolute) with an awareness of my freewill to be one with the Source.\n\n(Samadhi is nothing but realization of our I AM or Awareness is an idea waiting to experience or observe its highest potential creativity as Source Energy itself. And Mahasamadhi is the idea becoming one with Source Energy and the ceasing of \u201cI\u201d.)  \nDo not get entangled in words, just follow your bliss!\n\n(If it is something you seek, never expect it to happen in a particular way, you know the way and you\u2019ll find it. In fact don\u2019t even seek it, be in the state of love, embrace inner peace and happiness and let go of anything and everything that isn\u2019t letting you become.)  \nI was not intending anything, I was having no thoughts. I was just one. This body I have manifested originating from the intent to experience this reality was ready to dissolve. I never knew it. All the things that ever were and all the things that ever will be, anything that is part of the idea and the idea itself became part of me, my awareness was one with Source Energy/Superconsciousness/God/Universe (these are just words, it is realization that gives meaning to them). In that state, beyond time and space the dissolution happened and my physical self described that as \u201cI am in love with eternity\u201d the last feeling before I became zero.\n\nAt that realization, there was no attachment (I have been experiencing total detachment for a while, it is not as complicated as it sounds) and I AM became zero but a thought emerged out of that state which can only be described in words as \u201cyou are absolute and you can leave this body if so you wish\u201d.\n\nAnd I came back. I was in the awe of the experience but never knew what it was until I talked to a friend (with whom I haven't talked in about an year, an a phone call just happened) who guided me what I experienced was Mahasamadhi (don\u2019t get carried away but BIG words, they are just States, get carried away by your beauty and the love emerging out from within you) and the choice I made happened as you\u2019ve decided to stay back and remind as many as my Awareness , starting from all the people I am in touch with.\n\nNow, I am not a Guru or a Preacher or a Baba and neither would I preach. These are the words that confuse people. Don\u2019t fall for BIG words. Things are really simple, just let go the notion of contrast.\n\nI am just here to be a reference point (as we understand everything relatively) to remind you of your true nature, you are not above or below me or separate from me, we are all but same. I am not here to push you all towards Mahasamadhi, it is by your freewill, I am here to remind you of your essence. You should LIVE YOU.\n\nI am here for you, whoever is reading this and know this that you are being cared for, but also know this that there is enough love for you to share with everyone that enters your experience and more. You have the power to create new and for that you're here. You are not broken, you are whole, just create and observe don't attach and hold.\n\nI am not here to to talk about religion or to create another religion or cult or add to the list of dogmas and beliefs. I am here to Clarify who you truly are and to touch that in you so that you know you are not your body.\n\nYou are not here to fulfill anything or do anything. You are here simply to experience your creativity, your love. Your body is the only way Source could experience what you are experiencing but you have freewill, as you are the Source yourself, when you stop identifying and associating things and understand the absolute that you are, you can create the experience the reality you seek and live at your highest physical potential, if so you wish. But you have to move beyond your conditioning. Awareness is beyond the physical and this awareness is the I AM (which is nothing but Love) that thru realization communes into Nothing.\n\nAll that you seek is within you, rest will fall in place when you ask the right questions..you are perfect the way you are in this moment.\n\nTo attain enlightenment you don\u2019t have to leave the world, you just have to leave the conditioning and the notion of I you\u2019ve picked up from series of moments you experienced that you call life. Let there be flow of newness and creativity thru you as love, create, observe and experience. And as you please, with awareness, give up (just another word) the idea of separation.\n\nMerely reading this would be a gentle reminder to you.\n\nThank you everyone who has been instrumental in this and in reminding me, it\u2019s my turn. I am here to be in joy, to share love, to embrace you all into realization of our oneness. I am currently guiding 10 people, if you feel stuck at any portion of your life, or if you have any other questions or seek Clarity feel free to message me. Especially if it relates to your true nature or how to get there. There are no wrong questions, just perceptions and beliefs that you could hold on and trying to justify things.\n\nGreat!\"", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48125, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A Breakthrough!

The demoniac person may not agree to accept the supremacy of the Lord, and it is a fact that he may act according to his own whims, but his next birth will depend upon the decision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and not on himself. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, Third Canto, it is stated that an individual soul, after his death, is put into the womb of a mother where he gets a particular type of body under the supervision of superior power. Therefore in the material existence we find so many species of life-animals, insects, men, and so on. All are arranged by the superior power. They are not accidental. As for the demoniac, it is clearly said here that they are perpetually put into the wombs of demons, and thus they continue to be envious, the lowest of mankind. Such demoniac species of life are held to be always full of lust, always violent and hateful and always unclean. They are just like so many beasts in a jungle\n\n**Question 1 : What are the characteristics of a person born in  demoniac species of life ?

A close friend of mine recently  persuaded me to share my experience and tell my story  with the world and perhaps find others who have had similar encounters and beholding infinity.  This will be a long one and a doozy. But I hope this may shed light on some thing of our existence.   I will try to be as coherent as possible and try to follow the typical path of events. Albeit this is by no means in a traditional sense typical. It will later become apparent that trying to untangle all that I experienced for the 15 min of total actual time of spiritual awakening is actually quite hard to fathom into words... anyway I hope if you make it to the end everything will become clear. And if this turns into something much much longer than intended then I may have to release in phases...anyhoo\n\n\tIve always been facinated with reality, how we experience it physically, and pushing the envelope and boundaries of existence. Contantly being aware of the bigger picture of life, and trying to live it to the fullest. Ive also dabbled in hallucinogens several times in my past trying to \"uncover\" the truth to all this, to pierce  the veil the find who was behind the curtain so to speak. These of course helped, but always lacked something...\n\n\tSo fast forward to July 2017 after several years no longer really seeking actively, but always on my mind I suppose. We have some friends over and I didnt have to work the next day so I asked if perhaps I could have a few hits of their Cannabis. Ive partook several times before with these friends and usually dont smoke often, but there was this wild hair so to speak that was urging me subconsciously that I should at this moment in time do. So I did. At first it  was normal, had that head fuzzy feeling and general high. Everything so far was turning out to be a great July 4th with the friends as it typically is when I smoke with them. At this point after my typical two hits I take, as I know my limit, it started to get a bit overwhelming and I couldnt control myself from busting out with laughter. So i decided to leave to head to my room and try to enjoy some Xbox games while high (which is great btw ;) \n\n\tIn the amount of time it took to get to my room it hit me full brunt, the most uncomfortably high that is causing me want to throw up, pounding headache and heart racing. The sudden feeling of thirst as if ive been in a desert the past several days. Trying to alleviate the high I shut the door to my room and immediately hit the bed and shut my eyes trying to keep my head from falling of my body from the current spinning sensation I was facing. And then without any notice whatsoever I found myself seemingly lifted up to a birds eye view of the whole house.  I could see everything going on outside with the friends I had just left enjoying the evening, starting to panic I force my eyes open to the sight of still laying on my bed looking at the neutral color of my wall with the sun peeking its nose through the window above me. \n\n\tTrying to alleviate my sorrow, I mustered all of my remaining bodily energy I had left and reached for my phone in order to get one of my friends to bring me water. Three attempts later I get the password correct and the phone turns on to the main screen, and to my sheer amusement, on the phones screen I could view all the apps at every angle, under it, to the side, giving the entire 2d screen a realistic 3d look to it.  Oddly enough though, it was as if what I was looking at was in fact fake, and it was taking my brain to process the information to \"load\" reality into something my brain can understand. After seemingly minutes of amusement I remembered my original intent. So I get to the text screen to text my friend to please save me from this dread and bring me some water and check to see that im in fact not dying here...and then unconsciously and out of my full control I proceed to  text him \" that he needs to fight\"..ok..weird. But whatever. I put my phone back down and as if I havent slept in years, turn over and close my eyes to the same wall. \n\n\tFighting to stay conscious waiting for the water, it feels as if its taking my friend a literal eternity. So again I open my eyes in case I simply didnt hear him come in with the water. As I slowly open my eyes again im back in this same 3rd person viewing the house, the neighborhood, the town, my friends, all in and at the same moment.  It seems as if time itself has literally stopped in a single moment. I can feel every atom and particle of existence around me, coalescing in the air, the concrete, the trees, myself, everything, the Universe itself.  I instantaneously start viewing the hallway to my room, looking for any clue to whats going on. I see my friend coming down the hallway with water..but something was off, along with what I saw outside time had froze inside as well, and he was standing in a half walk motion about to turn the corner to my hallway...Then hes everywhere, in all motion at once. Im looking down a hall of infinity. This is when I realized what im actually seeing is time starting to  break down almost. As he was walking backwards, forwards, to the left, the the right, higher up, lower into the floor, in the walls at all once, literally an infinite amount of everywhere. I soon came to the realization what I  was actually viewing was  an infinite amount of choices he could take walking down this simple hallway, viewing how all past choices led him to this very single moment in time, how the choices he faces in the future will change. Infinite possibilities, past, present, and future simultaneously in one single nano second of perceived time. And as if something snapped, I start viewing everyone in the house, all of their \"infinite\" choices, viewing them layered upon one another seamlessly. I then start seeing all of these color protruding off of all of them. As if instinctively I knew that what I was seeing was all of their  emotions and energy made physical. Colors warping and spinning around each and every one in this given moment showing how they are feeling currently. I see how this energy is pervading all these choices they make. How the use of emotion and reaction in matters of choice and intent can change what may happen in the future.  If they are sad, deeply depressed, happy, angry, any and all emotions of the human wavelength. Viewing how these emotions can alter and change their paths, their choices, how they feel can directly impact their path in life. How all of  their choices can have a  negative or positive \"connotation\"  and how it can directly effect the choice they make. \n\n\tI then still not really in full control of what im doing, find myself having an unknown power to be able to \"align\" certain choices ( again still in the same nano moment here) that they can make. I can view every single past, present and future choice. Living out entire lifetimes of these friends from their point of view. Choosing how I want their lives to go. Aligning them into certain pathways I can follow. (honestly this is very hard to put into words) I eventually find myself having full attention on just the one friend bringing the water. I start sifting through all his \"pathways\" trying to almost find a certain path. Looking at future points in time to see how to proceed in the past. To know how to correctly steer present events. Sifting through all he can do according to all the choices he can make in the amount of time it will take him to walk down a simple 10ft hallway to my room. And viewing all the different pathways determined by emotion and intent.  I precisely try to \"guide\" him to what from my viewpoint will bring him into my room exactly how I intend it to happen. but ultimately he has to make the correct choices. I can view all pathways but it comes down to every  person to make their own \"correct\" choices.  So now all I  can do is watch on to see if he would correctly align to the pathway im currently wanting him to follow and align perfectly to the future outcome im hoping for.... And as if nothing happened, time resumed normally. \n\n\tThen as if im no longer high and completely coherent I sit up abruptly and turn over to view the door just as soon as my friends walks in. At this point im not sure what to think but I am back in \"normal\" time and reality and  as if the human in me comes out, I try my best to act cool and make it seem like all is well. Nothing hapening here so to speak...but as if the very thought of it occurred I starting to freak out. Its as if i dont let things happen as they are suppose to, the opposite will happen. In hindsight its to live life fluidly, letting it happen, whatever comes your way. \n\n\tWith this freak out I ask him to to take my pulse because at this point I swear my heart is going to literally pump out of my chest from the pressure. After taking my pulse, nothing, completely normal. So im thinking to myself at this point it must just be me, and I soon leave the subject alone, ask him to leave, and to please shut the door. I put the water down next to me, not really remembering why I asked for this in the first place. But do know the path I was wanting for him had actually come to pass.  With the fore knowledge you have to let it happen, I close my eyes, no longer caring about it, I let everything go...\n\n\tAnd as if I found a key to my own door to open, all my gears meshing, letting everything go, all control, any thought one way or the other. Simply neutral. Simply just Being. I find myself as a smooth ball of something that looked white and fuzzy with  energy surrounding me shooting upward at incredible speeds. As im viewing myself as this entity and in the 3rd person simultaneously,  I  look up to see where im heading uncontrollably. Im heading toward this near seemingly infinite dark dome that is shaped all around me into forever. I then realize that as im nearing the very top of this dome thing and im not slowing down, but in fact, speeding up. But for some reason I was ok with this, almost unconsciously knowing all is well. Just as im about to hit the top of whatever this thing was I stopped instantly, as if their was this magnetic push back or some unseen force not wanting me to pass. As these two forces are pushing at one another, me trying to pass, it not wanting me to,  I find that its almost as if its incorporating negative energy, and im the positive. I start to push this darkness out of the way, forcing my light into it, and incorporating its darkness within myself. Fighting everything and nothing. I then find myself with enough intent behind my actions, I assume all within this sphere of influence inside this shell, breaking it wide open and pushing through...upon instantly realizing im actually fighting myself, my ego, the shells of person ive put up to protect myself from any outside hurt, or sadness, loss. How I view myself, how I may change my many faces depending on who I may be around. Further and Further hardening my ego to never let not only anyone in, myself included, to never get to know who I really am. \n\n\tWith the  feeling as if ive done something substantial I look up to my horror im back in a similar shaped shell, only smaller. With a different hue and texture, and my feeling of accomplishment turned to naught,  that ive just started,  as if all ive done was break through my own facade. \n\n\tRealizing this is going to be a battle with myself and all of my own negativity, my positivity , every action, or choice ive made. My regrets in life, every wall ive ever put up to protect myself from something. Staring at the infinity of my own ego, I move onward and forward, with a mission to complete. To tear down the very fabric of the Self and the Ego. To shed the humanity of myself and all its implications that come along with it to finally perceive who I AM. I push forward.\n\n\t I soon start gaining control of what im doing and no longer just along for the ride. With this new ability of movement, I consciously and actively move upward toward the top of this next shell. Just like the last, the shell was full of negative energy. But even thicker than the last.  As I fight this new shell it soon become apparent that just like the last being my surface Ego and Facade, this one represents something a little more deeper than surface value. Leading it to be more difficult than the last one. But I realize that this shell is different, it represents something else. Something else ive put up as a wall, only thicker mortar. This one represented any past guilt and regret.  (As i came to understand later, these human happenings like regret and guilt, the negative aspect of your own Ego latches onto these throughout your life to create and harden these barriers of Thyself)\n\n\tSo to pass this one, it can be brute forced. I realized I needed to let go of all my past regret and guilt and let it just Be.  Once I came to terms with this and myself for everything ive done thats create guilt and regret in this singular life I managed to breakthrough once again. But this time several things occurred. As I pushed away the negative intent on this shell I could make in lower reality feel my very own body expelling negative energy thats built up over my lifetime, essentially cleansing myself of all negativity. Also while simultaneously as the shell broke I could feel and see and entire universe of possibilities explode out from me. Physically condensing down to singular point and exploding out rapidly with its very own big bang, in all directions away from me with lines of consciousness. Creating all together a universe onto itself the beginning of its own time, space and infinite possibilities, connecting possible futures, pasts, and presents.  \n\n\tTo make this as short as possible here, it so turns out that after breaking through that last shell, there was yet another one above it. Each representing something I have to come to terms with or move past.  At each junction expelling even more negative energy within the Ego and my physical body as well. Each time becoming even more intense and thicker to breakthrough. Further creating big bangs into other living universes that will go on till the end of time. While each time further shedding myself even further of the Ego and of thyself, becoming something else entirely.  I eventually make it to my seventh shell. The hardest and thickest one yet. Yet, there was nothing here at this one, nothing to move past, to learn from, to shed. I soon understood what this shell is, it represents everything that I AM. Who I was in previous lives, the accumulation of everything ive worked toward in all my lives ive lived. To understand who I AM. I then shed away the last traces I had of any individuality, emotion, personality, my collective experiences, and come to what it meant to be \"me\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey there, its getting a bit long for reddit so ill have a new post at some point very soon to get to what lies beyond this last shell..speculation??

Every time I'd be dragged into the Pentecostal church, I'd be told about how the devil is polluting society and that God's keeping a judgemental eye on us at all times and that if you were gay or liberal or liked yoga you were essentially signing your death warrant. (The politicization eventually got to be too much for even my conservative dad and he ended up taking us to a more lax Wesleyan church.)\n\nI really tried to go along with it and be a good little Christian girl, but...the strict and stifling nature never clicked with me. I had this gut feeling about God, that he wasn't this big scary judge waiting for the next chance to condemn you, but an all-loving proctector and nurturer.\n\nDespite how jaded I became with organized religion and strict dogma, I could never *not* believe in God. I didn't wanna feel all alone in the universe. I didn't wanna feel like my loved ones who passed away were just...gone forever.\n\nSomewhere along the line, I also started looking into new-age and eastern belief systems. I started believing in things like chakras, the universe, life energy, meditation. Despite it going against everything I was taught to believe, it just sort of makes more sense to me.\n\nSo right now I think my spirituality is somewhere between the western/Abrahamic perception of God and eastern/Dharmic/new-age spiritual beliefs and philosophies. I feel like God works through us however we observe spirituality. He works with us through prayer, meditation, chakras, yoga, reiki, etc...whatever it is that works for the individual. It's all about intent, IMO. I feel like to adhere to a dogma based *only* on what you've been taught by your elders is stifling to the soul and keeps us from reaching a real, genuine connection to God.\n\nI feel comfortable with my beliefs, but I sometimes have...fears. Doubts. Like the Pentecostal church's teachings are trying to worm their way back into my head and tell me I'm a bad person and I'm \"doomed to hell\" for \"going against the lord.\" I know it's silly, but I guess I've always been an overthinker.\n\nSo why am I telling you all of this? Why am I pouring my soul out to an entire subreddit full of strangers at risk of making a total fool of myself?\n\nI guess I'm just looking for some validation. A sign that I'm not some sort of awful heathen or crazy person and I'm not damning myself to an eternity in hell. I felt like this might be a good place to turn to. I apologize if my post is just clutter on here. I just wanted to get it all off my chest.\n\nThanks for listening to my inane ramblings.\n\nBless.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48059, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My spiritual beliefs are...confusing?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564629736, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ck2pf7/my_spiritual_beliefs_areconfusing/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "booberrymuffins", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2damj5fj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564540504, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ck26e3/spirituality_psychedelics/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ck26e3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 38, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ck26e3/spirituality_psychedelics/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564540505, "score": 8, "selftext": "After doing psychedelics such as DMT or mushrooms, I find myself a very spiritual person.

If I never did psychedelics, would have I ever even known about spirituality ??", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48050, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Spirituality &amp; Psychedelics?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564626890, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ck26e3/spirituality_psychedelics/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "HeavenlyLightOC", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2bc8ujij", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564538920, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ck1vnm/i_interacted_with_jesus_as_the_consciousness_of/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ck1vnm", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ck1vnm/i_interacted_with_jesus_as_the_consciousness_of/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564538922, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 48048, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I interacted with Jesus as the consciousness of the Sun", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564625312, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ck1vnm/i_interacted_with_jesus_as_the_consciousness_of/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "weeklytheobite", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_n3nyt", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564536399, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ck1ecp/thoughts_on_the_mysticpoet_george_william_russel/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ck1ecp", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ck1ecp/thoughts_on_the_mysticpoet_george_william_russel/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "FjA51XxDb1bMV-1ZaPUd10Qjnt9zIZaU_s6JtkasXLY", "resolutions": [{"height": 75, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/tCRdBHvTnpYezeaZDdd8Q8SaAC0zpJcsm13zU3c6oog.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0c7f531b5c8b6bbe2350cb60a1757d68beba3cb", "width": 108}, {"height": 151, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/tCRdBHvTnpYezeaZDdd8Q8SaAC0zpJcsm13zU3c6oog.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b96f6862f5dc5134361da571b9a0e14a6a2af24f", "width": 216}, {"height": 224, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/tCRdBHvTnpYezeaZDdd8Q8SaAC0zpJcsm13zU3c6oog.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b92f6f6de3e94e7fd7926d70bef693605205044e", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 316, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/tCRdBHvTnpYezeaZDdd8Q8SaAC0zpJcsm13zU3c6oog.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=89d756ce25c2eb9db6969adeb4dbbff8e9d31c8e", "width": 450}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1564536400, "score": 3, "selftext": "Hi all,   \nGeorge William Russel (AKA \u00c6) was an Irish patriot/theosophist/and Celtic mystic.  \nI did a short talk on him - [Here is the Link](https://www.lewisconnolly.com/post/2019/7/30/lammas-amp-the-mundus-imaginalis).

He doesn't cry, just doesn't seem happy and babbles to me pointing and unsettled. It's creeping me out a bit as he has done this on a few occasions, and always pointing to the same place.\n\nI'm not sure if he's pointing at the door, or the wall behind it (the way the bedroom is set out, his bed is against the wall that the door is on, so with the door open it blocks him being able to see a portion of the wall). There is one of those spongey things on the top of the door that's to stop his fingers getting trapped, and also star stickers on the ceiling, so I'm not sure if he was pointing at them. But they've been there a year and he has never seemed bothered by then before.\n\nHe also shares the room with my 8year old daughter, who has never mentioned anything out of sorts, so I'm not sure if I'm just freaking myself out... I am new on the spiritual path and have some a few guided meditations, some to meet my spirit guide. Now I'm afraid that I have let bad energy or something into the house... I read a post where someone had said to be careful doing guided meditations as it can let unwanted spirits in. \n\nWhat do you guys think? And is there anything I can do to rid any bad energy? I have white sage, would burning some of that around the house help?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5",

last night and to say the least it has shaken me to my very core. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a year I have been reading everything on this subreddit and trying to do it but with no luck but last night something was different somehow and I woke up in the middle of the night with all the vibrations and everything and it was so amazing, and I felt incredibly emotional, and just writing this is making me tear up, it was so incredible, I dont know how to describe it, but in a matter of seconds I could feel myself being lifted from my body the sensations of it all are almost indescribable...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n it was like I was on an alien planet that was all purple, just all of a sudden I was standing there, and infront of me was this sparkly big lion creature, it looked so beautiful and had such a beautiful calming feeling coming into me, and it told me all of these simply awe inspiring unbelievable things! but without a voice! the ideas from its head were almost like being beamed into my head!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt told me that the key to everything was love! And then all of a sudden I felt what I can only describe as a feeling of unconditional love flow through me! it was the most amazing thing Ive ever felt! how amazing is that guys? wow i cant believe im crying right now its just that its love!!! its so beautiful!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe told me that I have a very very important mission to do! He said that me and everybody must stay on earth, and learn to work together as friends, and help every get happier with love, so that we can somehow affect the earths core to somehow take this world into the fourth dimension! He said that in the fourth dimension nothing can die and you can fly around and stuff!!! How cool is that guys??? he said under no circumstance can anyone leave earth, because if they did, that would be bad because we would do bad stuff in the spiritual realm! :) he says we need to go through trials and connect to love and raise our vibrations to become better people with love so that the whole world can become whole again and not die and stuff in the fourth dimension, and then hopefully we will continue going up dimensions! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhe also said that having attachments is bad! how intelligent is that guys??? its just mind blowing, and it doesn't stop there!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhe also said that everything is energy! he said there is no type of food beyond energy! That must be true right guys?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then guess what happened guys?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said to him, actually buddy, love isnt shit! and theres a type of real food, superior to energy! I told him that I knew he was a literal demon who was just energy and missing the real food in its body somehow, and thats why they all look like shadows, and I told him that I knew he had coaxed my body into this little fairy land dream world of his while my I was in the NREM stage of sleep, I told him that everything about the dimensional transition concept is completely false because the energy loner machine world that earth is in has these balls called atoms, and by nature those little balls form things up and down, and that cannot ever change no matter what dimension youre in, its all complacency propaganda everybody! to keep us here in this energy farm for these literal insects! WE have to leave these lesser bodies, get all of ourselves together and instantly teleport ourselves back home to where the real food grows off trees and never look back!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou guys just all got trolled with a made up story that is loosely based on a real experience of mine but with a higher knowledge twist!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am really looking forward to debating all of you complacency propaganda victims! remember the concept, if you cant prove me wrong with rational ideas, you just serve to prove me more right!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 47974, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What a spirit taught me last night (First experience)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564599611, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cjwbxj/what_a_spirit_taught_me_last_night_first/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Nameleop", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1t6zdsqc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564510836, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cjvsch/legs_go_numb_in_meditation/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cjvsch", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cjvsch/legs_go_numb_in_meditation/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564510837, "score": 1, "selftext": "10 minutes into my meditation my legs will go numb.

Why emphasis is given to the word avidhi-p\u016brvakam in this verse ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** Thinking themselves all in all, not caring for any authority or scripture, the demoniac sometimes perform so-called religious or sacrificial rites. And since they do not believe in authority, they are very impudent. This is due to illusion caused by accumulating some wealth and false prestige. Sometimes such demons take up the role of preacher, mislead the people, and become known as religious reformers or as incarnations of God. They make a show of performing sacrifices, or they worship the demigods, or manufacture their own God. Common men advertise them as God and worship them, and by the foolish they are considered advanced in the principles of religion, or in the principles of spiritual knowledge. They take the dress of the renounced order of life and engage in all nonsense in that dress. Actually there are so many restrictions for one who has renounced this world. The demons, however, do not care for such restrictions. They think that whatever path one can create is one's own path; there is no such thing as a standard path one has to follow. The word avidhi-p\u016brvakam, meaning disregard for the rules and regulations, is especially stressed here. These things are always due to ignorance and illusion.  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 16.17, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/cjt1hy/qa\\_verse\\_no1617/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/cjt1hy/qa_verse_no1617/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 47933, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "QA : Verse no.16.17", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564585628, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cjt1qs/qa_verse_no1617/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TFTFRIENDS", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3ykqqas3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564497670, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cjsorr/out_of_bodyselfless_state_experience/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cjsorr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cjsorr/out_of_bodyselfless_state_experience/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564497671, "score": 5, "selftext": "I felt like this would be the right place to share an experience I had about a month a go.

Usually I\u2018m getting goosebumps on my head and feel more alert while listening to his talks. That time, it was a more intense experience. I vaguely remember him talking about the polarities of positive and negative, and it was something like 'there is no good without bad, sweet without sour, no me without the other. They are the same thing disguised in each polarity. They are a happening, in the same way that you and the other are simply a happening.\u2018 As I heard this, I felt my head vibrating, but with higher intensity than usual. Then, I believe, I was 'free\u2018 of my mind for maybe the first time. Free of who is texting this story into his phone right now. It wasn\u2018t that my thoughts stopped completely, I was just so shocked of this idea of 'you and the other are the same, disguised in their polarities' that my mental structure broke.

next month. I've been on my own spiritual journey for about 3 to 4 years, I think. Learning more about spirituality has had a really positive effect on me, but I always have problems keeping in touch with this side of myself. I think a lot of it has to do with school. School is incredibly time consuming, it has a lot of pressure attached to it, and a lot of the kids there are dealing with insecurities and various societal pressures (not saying that these kids are somehow bad for how they feel, I'm just mean school isn't the most chill place). Also I struggle to really form and maintain connections to other people because I'm not really like most kids my age. I mean, most 15 year olds I've met wouldn't be too interested in hearing me ramble about the benefits of 432hz music, and they probably don't think that the idea that life is a really trippy dream where nothing matters is sound advice to help them get over an ex or whatever.\n\n Anyway, all of this stuff makes it hard for me to focus on the lessons I've learned on my journey, so I often find myself being sad about life as a whole. This thinking usually results in me ending up falling into an existential thought loop, which then leads to periods of depression. Not being able to relate to my peers also makes me feel pretty sad and alone. I have 1 best friend who I care about like family, but it would be nice to have more people to hang out with.\n\nWell this getting kinda long winded but TL;DR: Can anyone give me advice on how to stay focused on spirituality and connect to others in a highschool setting?

He is envious of both the scriptures and of the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is caused by his so-called prestige and his accumulation of wealth and strength. He does not know that the present life is a preparation for the next life. Not knowing this, he is actually envious of his own self, as well as of others. He commits violence on other bodies and on his own. He does not care for the supreme control of the Personality of Godhead because he has no knowledge. Being envious of the scriptures and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he puts forward false arguments against the existence of God and refutes the scriptural authority. He thinks himself independant and powerful in every action. He thinks that since no one can equal him in strength, power, or in wealth, he can act in any way and no one can stop him. If he has an enemy who might check the advancement of his sensual activities, he makes plans to cut him down by his own power.\n\n**Question 1 : Why a demoniac person is envious of the scriptures and the Supreme Personality of Godhead ?

It\u2019s more about *allowing* Grace to happen.\u00a0\n\n* How do we be very specific about what we want and still *allow* a miracle?\u00a0\n* How do we allow something that we aren\u2019t controlling?\u00a0\n* How do we create a container for healing so that it can come into being?\n\nThe  way I do this subtle but powerful inner gesture is with a daily  personal spiritual practice.\u00a0 Frankly, most religions and most distance  healing practices cut off genuine spirituality. They get you somewhere,  but not to the place I go when I work with cancer.\u00a0 The way to have  genuine spirituality is\u2026 (drumroll please for a cosmic Duh!)\u2026 is to  actually to have a genuine personal spiritual practice irrespective of  dogma. A good religious practice can guide you towards authentic  spirituality, but often we use religion as a substitute. There needs to  be something authentic and objective with it.\u00a0 It\u2019s an actual  give-and-take between you and the Divine, between you and the  non-physical, between you and your supra-conscious, between you and God,  between you and the parts of yourself that you\u2019re usually only vaguely  aware of. This spiritual \u201cplace\u201d is beyond emotions and images. This  spiritual place includes thinking and comprehending Truth, as well as  the place beyond thinking\u2013 the places where the thoughts and inspiration  come from.\u00a0\n\nHopefully,  this tip helps you appreciate that while there are technique and skill  in Distance Healing, it\u2019s more about how to allow than how to do.\u00a0 That  is something that is *cultivated over time* in the privacy of your inner gesture to your very real and powerful spiritual self.\n\nHere\u2019s a video I am talking about Using [Spiritual Practice to Enhance Distance Healing.](https://youtu.be/iyrO4PSTS8A)\n\nA group of us do a community distance healing every week at my Facebook Group \u201c[Spirit Gate Cancer Support](https://www.facebook.com/groups/194593417781239)\u201d.

Where did your emotions come from, not it's me.\n\nand what made you react, the truth to why you react start with you being true to yourself.\n\nsex, it\u2019s not what you claim, it\u2019s to help those wish to come back to this realm to finish their past life goals. \n\nif you at your death bed, wish you reborn again into a family, or whatever you promised yourself at death door, either to fix up a karma cycle, rekindling twin flames, finding that lost love, or reborn to not attachments to life but help,and serve to help others on their journey to awaken, but everyone is a manifestation of a human desire, someone out there made a wish about you, sad truth, they are not what expected, or even understand, but the attraction so strong, it causes shifts.\n\nbut sex, before the universe, there was a divine consciousness, this divine consciousness created this world, god is a label for a material being, just as jesus is a material being. you do not put faith in a material. remember? \nnow aliens, ancient civilization wanted to preserve the divine consciousness, but how? they can\u2019t implant a soul into an insect, a plant, or animals that does not have the capacity to think. so they took apes, similar in fashion but can multiply using a egg and sperm.\nnow, for the divine consciousness to reborn, they had to experiment what works. trails and errors, humans came to be. \n\nnow why sex. sex is to create. it\u2019s not love, it\u2019s not joy, passion, or happiness. it feels good, but it\u2019s a feeling, not an expression. \nespress means action, not mute. you espress love through action aka sex, but does this so call love feel last? then it\u2019s not true love, lust, spur of the moment, your ego fuck up your heart.\n\nmy definition of sex, it\u2019s to bring back a soul that everyone wish a love one comes back.\nYou think those kids are really yours? Cause you gave them life, a name and they have all the physical, personality, everything that came from your Gene, is yours? Because you gave it life, you label them your property, shelter it, protect it, but you never going to teach it, show it, the truth of why you wanted the being here, or there, cause of family obligations? Pride to prove your worth? Wanted to be call a father, mother? \nHow about you didn't know how to love yourself explicitly, but search for someone, waiting for someone, but just like that, controlling the situation by forcing your way to be with a partner, and what happen? Fears, you jump into marriage. Scare of other people opinion, you madevkids, to join the crowd, but are you living your truth, honest about the whole situation? Before you met, date or married, what were your true self like, before you had friends that turn you, shape you into the way society look at you? \nBut ask yourself, are you really happy, honestly, go back to your family album, are you truly happy. \nIf you truly feel a small dose of sad, it means something is truly not right. It only took one spark to cause an evolution.\n\nIf a small part of you feel unhappy, lost, confuse, and don't understand what I want you to look at, let me say it to people who are uneducated in this field, did I am call you stupid? No. Everyone is ignorant to the truth and rather be comfortable living in their fake situation.\n\nWhen you think you love someone, is a thought, not an action. now look at the actions from your kids to your spouses, ask yourself, are you truthly happy in your situation.\n\ndisplaying truth or fake when you look at each other, is that the real you wants to go out, but look at your partner, he not interested in those things, then he says he wants to go fishing, and you wanted to go out, not fishing, compromising to make the relationship work, but just like that, you want this, she wasn't that, that not listening to each other, but I want to do me , either joy me ( UItimaum) or go. The ego talks.\n\nAnd that where you don't see, cause you told yourself, he is or she the one. \nwhen you jump from one heart break to the next, you have not took the time to figure out who you want, but assume this is it. \n\nTill you take the time to know yourself, you only attracting the wrong crowd into your life, \n\nits only going to be 18 years till your child is adult, raised in the wrong environment, cause you just want to RUSH your love life again? \n\nargument cause you are needy, obsess, jealous, insecure, and definitely not spiritual. That the shadows side. The light side, detach, and give out space and time to grow, but the shadows side, want to rush life.\nEveryone choose to live by the shadow ways, being jealous, possessive, clingy, the negative traits in a power hungry relationship.\n\nThat the reason you go on a spiritual journey, to learn about not just about you, but also your soul. What make you whole. What makes you happy.\nIf you say, you want someone to make you happy, that is codependent, not loving yourself\n\nThe hard part, being single and assume you love yourself, you don't need healing, you are happy now to jump,back on the love train, well if you did, true love be by yourside, but it's not, just Another ego.\n\n Learn how to love yourself without Co dependant on a another assets of material, money, or wealth. Work on yourself, when you think you love someone, you only love them for the material possession, and what benefits your needs, tell me, you love them with all your heart, you mean it, and not regret a moment that you made that choice,if you still believe in the person, your children is your true happiness, i mean  true happiness, you live with that choice. \ni am helping you understand this cycle of life, your true purpose isn\u2019t to be in loved, be in a relationship, have kids, or make money, destroying this world with manifestions of the material, cause life is that hard, you need things to make your life easily, i understand, but when your truly happy, you will see what i see, but from my point of you, you will shun my knowledge, you will call me names, you will doubt my nature, you will even find ways to slander my name, i dare you , i challenge every one of you to a 30 day challenge.\n\nto understanding yourself. you going to change, transform, and you either go all in, or quit, leave and go back to your world that you strive to make a living for, your desire for love, desire to be free, desire to create, your desire to enjoy, but look around you, the person next to you, your friends, family, you see the smiles on their faces? then something is wrong. one minute your happy, then the next your sad, one minute your angry, the next you are excited, where the balance? where is the truth? \nyou let these life challenges gives you doubts, fears, neglected, and most of all, unloved to yourself.\ni already ascensed, you don\u2019t see what i see, and i am not telling you what i see, cause, if i told you what i see, you either reacted, be upset, or even become negative, is that what you want? if you can\u2019t handle the truth life exposes you too, or of, and you can\u2019t handle the truth, then my truth is not for you, but those wants the truth, no matter how bad it looks, or hear, the truth will set you free.\n\nif this made you reacted, pissed of, I hit the bulleyes, only those don't find post pissed, very UNOFFEND , thinking living their truth, those react , you are living that lie, I pointed you out, now you want to slander my name, so be it.\nAnd you want to prove your point by reacting, go ahead, react , DEFEND your REASONS, doesn't change the fact, you are still in the same cycle situation. \nBut be stupid , keep living your repeat cycle of heartbreaks situation. Don't put your happiness in your kids, but yourself\n\nSomeday, your kids needs to learn that.\nYou want them to experience the shitty relationship you had? \nTeach them to love themselves first. Or they be learning how to be attached. In life , attachment is suffering.\n\nHow? are the you blind? Definition of attachment.\n\nCling to a idea, or beliefs. You teaching them to hold on to a person, no matter if mommy and daddy yells at me, calls me names, my partners loves me the same as my parents , so I don't see the problem why I would leave my partner cause he treats me wrong, mommy yelled at daddy, mommy hitbdad with a chair, but they still together, My family loves me for me, why Cant you? \n\nAttachment to the good memories, wanting to relive that past, you meet anyone, to relive that cycle.\nafter a heartbreak, you didn't focus on loving yourself, you focusing on loving another that you expect give you the same love you give out. Right? \n\nIf any one Cry, loss, tears attaching to a sour untruthful love.\nThen you think of on saying, I don't need that person, you went off, finding another person you are attracted to, again, without taking the time to know what you really want, you jump in the lust train again, but this time, you have kids that you wasn't ready for.\n\nYou live your life in a half truth situation. \n\nco depended on a father, mother, grandparents, \nthey are precious, but what would I know, in my past lives, I probably havee 20,000 other soul family, wives, kids. \nyes, i am no different living under the same roof, or afford to live on my own,  cause of circumstances, so i am in the same boat , but i am paying rent. but co depedant is a different term for idiots who looks at the word but never find time to look at the definition. \n\ndo not be co dependent in a relationship, you will experience obession, neediness, addictions to them, \nexpectations. these are shadow qualities e everyone have. \nit\u2019s cause you left a heart break relationship, you seek out other Attractive potential of your past. \nyou missed your ex? so you didn\u2019t give yourself time to love yourself, you went out, looking, searching, expecting to just  giving yourself away to any man that you just met, that can give you the sense of security like your past relationship, or perhaps met a old friend, but just like that, jump in. if you are arranged marriage, no diiferent, force into a situation without knowing how to even love oneself, but expect to love others base on family traditions pass down from generations, not Breaking that traditions that no longer works. \n\ni told you, i am going to open the world eyes, and it\u2019s going to cause ripples of effects, and i will be hunt down by those that fears my truth.\n\nI don't need to pro create to fit in like the rest of this world or you, perks of being gay, bi, you label me anything but a rich man lol\n\ncause I am not the one waking up everyday to oh I am fucking tired, baby crying, work is calling, she a bitch, he is a creep, terrible parents. The noises you hear from people around you, talking behind your back, causes fear to mold you to fit into what they think, talk, or response, and you wanted to goto in, you changed your truth for them\n\nDid I shatter your dreams, hope, belief system, if I did, would you believe Jesus if he said the same truth as I told you, but in a different perspective? \n\nThe world been spinning, evolving, but \nYou don't know yourself, so your still living like a camel, day in day out, knows only one pattern,  to eat, sleep and work, and follow the life they Think they meant to gave, but let others ride their life out, making them useful to society. sounds like you? \na lion shows no fears, it will hurt anyone trying to hurts it family, it will defend anyone for it have pride, ego, and a fire to protect. - just like man or woman trying to prove their self worth in this world, for what? being right. and what did being right brings you? isolation, untrusted emotions, doubts, fears, and worst unfullfill. \nnow you are a human, that not a camel, or a lion, so why do you live like that? did that hurt you what you read? why? truth hurts doesn\u2019t it.\n\nWhy you are still here reborn? Looking for your past life attachment, why else would you only looking for a partner, love? it\u2019s to help you ascend out of this world. \n\u2018what\u2019s a soulmate, what\u2019s a twin flame, what are these words that nobody understand but only heard?\n\nhow the experience really works without any testing \n\nif you have a woman that about to be pregnant, you have a dying friend, husband, or someone you wish they didn\u2019t go. you bring the pregnant woman around the presence of their death, why? so their soul can jump into the pregnant person, without knowing where you going to end up, your soul made a choice to reborn, here you are, recreating your past life\u2019s, everything feel som nostalgia connecting with strangers but could be your soulmate, or father, brother sister or whoever, treat everyone with kindness, you never know who soul that is, and that could be the one you been looking for, but again, you can look at this message as a grain of salt, there is no right or wrong, it\u2019s just if someone said something, it sparks up a negative in you, you ask yourself why you feel that way towards my comment? what do you have an insight, or dig deep for information? you have any truth? what are your sources? if you don\u2019t have any, and just want to judge people, you are a unspiritual. spirituality is about you, your journey, your soul, it\u2019s not a travel guide, it\u2019s going within you to find you. not what people label you as maria, or john. see, if you only see this pattern of your name is this, then that all you ever know, \n, don\u2019t point me out knowing you couldn\u2019t come up with your own solutions, and your pride and ego is upset, someone figured it out first? egotistical human.\n\nwhat are the angels/divine waiting for? you waiting for the second coming\n, the second jesus\n, they waiting on the supreme ruler to be reborn, one of us human is the divine consciousness, and they are taking their time for this being to grow, to find its truth to the universe, this world is a simulation, but that the hard part, they created a human that multiply, and for them to find the divine consciousness, that like jesus hiding in a haystack somewhere, or the divine consciousness is a gay man in the closet, nobody knows the soul, or yourself, or who we are, but the divine consciousness does, and they waiting for a signal that the divine consciousness is ready, cause the world isn\u2019t ready yet, so is the divine. so live your life as a egotistical human.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 47830, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "are you the self or the ego.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564536862, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cjkr7f/are_you_the_self_or_the_ego/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tunesaga", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1964y436", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564449480, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cjkkao/so_you_truly_love_yourself/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cjkkao", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cjkkao/so_you_truly_love_yourself/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564449481, "score": 0, "selftext": "i am just posting stuff, if ya just want to react that your bussiness, reminder, take this with a grain of salt.\n\nyou tell me, you love yourself right\ud83d\ude00 truly?\nHonestly? No holding back? Serious? Ok you stick with that honest answer til the end. No matter what I say, you truly love yourself that you don't need to change anything about you, right? \n\nSo why the make up, the yoga, the fitness? See, I touch a nerve. \nbut before that. \n\nyou are not the vessel, you are not the mind, you are not the ego, you are not an opinion, you are not comparing, you are a soul. \n\nwithin everyone is a deep source of.....i can\u2019t say much, cause you all will look at me like with \ud83d\ude1c, like you all will assume \u201cI\u201d need help, but it\u2019s actually YOU. so i am here just to ask a simple question. do you truly love yourself, or you lying cause your mind told you too, but your heart feels a different sense otherwise? what am i getting at? before i answer , my purpose in life is to be nothing ordinary. \n\nit\u2019s not going to heaven or a place call hell. it\u2019s to help each and every soul on this planet to get where their true calling is. but i can\u2019t change the world mindset, but it only takes a very good story to change hearts.\n\nare you a camel? only knows the structure, pattern, cycle of eating, sleeping, working, maybe play if have time. sounds familiar like your everyday life?\nare you a lion? defend his pride and ego, fight off anything to defend it dignity, joy, and what he works for, defend his rights. also sounds familiar? everyday everyone trying to prove their appearance, a point, a message across to one person, but it went over their head, so you defend your rights to be right. right? \nare you the soul? no gender, no male, no female, it\u2019s just consciousness. confusing right? or easy to understand? i guess m getting somewhere with you, if you still reading. \n\nlet say there an amoeba. the very first single cell that created this vessel. \nthis amoeba created more cells from being alone, and just like the amoeba create cells, it create patterns, more different cells, with different characters, personalities, so it overwhelm, it isolated, to fit in with the other cells, it shifted from this kind person, to that aggressive person, from one self to the next, trying to find a form you can say \"fits\", that would not clash with those that look at you as some kind of divine being \ud83d\ude02 \nwithout hurting one another, you shifted from your truth state to another different state, leaving your old true self in the dark, your true happiness from within.\n\nwhen you understand this basic knowledge, you see i am not hurting you, my words have no,action, it\u2019s you, within yourself is hurt, anger, reacted, triggered by a post that trying to resonate with that very soul within you.\nbut a lot will be anger, but never going to go within and be true to themselves but take it on me, i guarantee, one person will blow up saying this is bull crap.\n\nunderstand this - if a man say this magic trick work, it works, but a student says, teacher, it will not work for me. just like that, the student doubt himself without evening trying, so his pattern of doubts will always be there, unless.....the teacher said, if everyone in this class know it works, trying to make it work, so it works for them, but if you believe it does not work for you, cause you chose not to understand it, work on it, and you give up, so it will not work for you.\n\nso if this is bull crap, you may leave to chase your addictions to sex, drugs, friends, money, possessions that you dying to get your hands on. those see the truth may stay and read\n\ndeep within the center of you is your own true self, not this vessel, not in that selfie you just took, make up, your hair, your lipsticks, everyday a person hoping their appearance attracts the man, woman, changes every 10 min, drinking, eating, excersice, yoga, all these things the mind tricks you, the ego wants you, they both need you to fit in this hell hole. \n\noutlook on life is hell is earth. heaven is within yourself, -self-love\nwhen you strip off all attachments to your family, friends, and things that hold you back from truly loving yourself, you will reach this state of awareness.\n\nthose think that self love is sex, that how low your IQ is. did i touch a nerve? if i did, you shouldn\u2019t think it was a sex act, stupid bitch \ud83d\ude02 \n\nyou leave your ego, your pride, this vessel in the mind, and live your truth, the life with your true self.\nthe only thing that is heaven is true love from within, when you found true love from within, life around you, changes. the wheel of fortune always turns up right when you are living in your truth, but when your stuck to the material realm of wanting love, needing love, attention, money, addictions, you won\u2019t find true happiness within them.\n\nmarriages, relationships, your kids, they all play a part to everyone ascension, or spiritual awaken.\nhow many cycles of lifetime you been here? doesn\u2019t matter, what matter is now correct? but if this now always been the same for you, reborn again, relive in this material plane looking for.....love? relationship? marriage? settling down? that the experience.\n\nwhat experience? the experience to find love in another, then teach yourself how to love another, proving how you do things for another is love, feels good everytime you DO IT for your kids, your hubby, your wife, real good right? that when you truly blind.\nyou did that to nurture them, nothing to,nurture your soul.\nyou think caring for someone, buying gifts and showing appreciation is part of nurturing the soul, or nurturing ones ego? pride? \nyou neglected yourself, giving your very soul energy to your kids, your work, and these things that takes your life, and what happen? you lost yourself to these obligations, situations, stuck? not loving yourself.\n\nin order to,reach my state of awareness, you have to leave all attachments behind. it\u2019s a sad true statement. \n\nwith you creating a family, you are now attachments to suffer. attachments is suffering. attachments to obsessive thinking of wants, needs, deadlines, activity, pressing matters, the quality that going to make you look at your own life, after your kids are grown, now what? exactly. day in and day out, constantly thinking how, when, what, where. how does it feel to read this truth? hurts right? anger? from within you, you are upset at your own soul. i am only guiding you to find your soul, nothing else. unless i am a healer, i can do that too. \n\nbut let get back to do you truly love yourself. \ud83d\ude02\nyou say you truly do? even if \nyou going to see every dark aspect of yourself, being needy from to find love in another to you slaving yourself for attention, you felt that give you love, your time, attention and effort, they will reciprocate. look at your self, in the mirror, you tell me you love yourself, you do? \nyou positively sure you truly love yourself?\n\nno denial? \n\ni am going to tell you a secret that going to make you change your mind, that i am right, you are wrong. and you going to hate me, but i want you to hate me, disconnect me, cause you are earthly attachments to my true ascension. but again, you not going to,back down? final answer that you truly do love everything about yourself? ok\n\ni dare you, challenge you too look at yourself in the mirror again, now tell yourself you love yourself without holding back. you love you eyes, your features, your vessel that you are born in, you tell me, you truly love yourself, without holding back, correct? so whatever i say now mean you truly mean it? You happy at yourself? Are you sure? You  think i am bullshiting you? \n\n\ud83d\ude02 okay, if you really truly love yourself from every fiber of your body, look in the mirror, again, NAKED\nGo ahead, how you feel now?

I went to therapy and am now in a very happy and healthy relationship. I moved in with my partner about a year ago and ever since I have felt this very intense pull to dive deeper spiritually. My partner is not religious/spiritual at all. I have expressed to them what I am feeling, and they are very supportive of me pursuing any and all of my interests. Immediately upon moving in with them, aside from experiencing this intense \"pull\" feeling (not sure how else to describe it), some other odd things have been happening. \n\nLike clockwork, I have started to wake up again between 2:45 and 3 every single night. It doesn't matter what time I go to sleep, if I have taken melatonin/zzzquil, if I had a few drinks, etc. I can't manage to keep myself asleep past three no matter what I do. This happened to me a lot when I was a child too, but seemed to go away in my teen years. \n\nI know the brain seeks out patterns, but I seem to be noticing them way more.

Or is it just my brain noticing patterns and a touch of insomnia? \nI am interested in these things, but I also try to be rational and figure out if there's a natural explanation for these things. I live in a state where marijuana is legal and I use it recreationally, nothing excessive just mostly evening's during the work week to try and help me sleep.

The demoniac thinks that all these things are accidental and due to the strength of his personal ability. He does not sense any arrangement behind all the varieties of people, beauty, and education. Anyone who comes into competition with such a demoniac man is his enemy. There are many demoniac people, and each is enemy to the others. This enmity becomes more and more deep-between persons, then between families, then between societies, and at last between nations. Therefore there is constant strife, war and enmity all over the world.\"\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n**Question 2 : What example has been given in this verse to explain the demoniac mentality ?**  \n**Answer 2 :** \"As far as promotion to the higher planetary system is concerned, he does not believe in performing yaj\u00f1as or sacrifices. Demons think that they will manufacture their own process of yaj\u00f1a and prepare some machine, by which they will be able to reach any higher planet. The best example of such a demoniac man was R\u0101va\u1e47a. He offered a program to the people by which he would prepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the heavenly planets without performing sacrifices, such as are prescribed in the Vedas.\"  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 16.16, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n Related pic : [https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/cjcmyq/qa\\_verse\\_no1616/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/cjcmyq/qa_verse_no1616/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 47738, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "QA : Verse no.16.16", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564500018, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cjcn9v/qa_verse_no1616/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Trustheuniverse9", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_425o8g22", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564411677, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cjc7qp/moon_sign_cant_sleep_all_week_sun_sign_sleepy_all/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cjc7qp", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cjc7qp/moon_sign_cant_sleep_all_week_sun_sign_sleepy_all/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564411679, "score": 8, "selftext": "Mainly asking for my moon bc he is wondering if anyone else is having the same issues.

Tetris gives us different pieces to play with, some pieces more fitting and convenient than others. It\u2019s a game we\u2019re all playing just like life which is handing us situations and events to face continuously, some convenient and others not so convenient. A skillful Tetris player knows not to worry about what pieces comes next, he just PLAYS the game because he\u2019s taught himself the ability to skillfully play with any piece Tetris hands him. That gives him all the confidence he needs to approach the game. He flows with Tetris. \n\nWhat if we thought about life like that on a continuous basis, learning how to skilfully maneuver any situation no matter how challenging it is. What if we see life as a game, something happening for us rather than to us. What if we equip ourselves with the tools necessary to be able to see life this way on a day to day basis where we\u2019re confident in our abilities to deal with any situation in the most skillful way. You eliminate stress &amp; worry entirely and you learn to get comfortable with uncertainty. Life becomes fun doesn\u2019t it, because we start to look forward to the next piece life hands us regardless of what it is rather than worrying about what it will be. We start to deal with every piece life hands us in the present moment in the most beneficial way possible. \n\nAsk yourself, what is the most skillful way possible to deal with the situation you\u2019re facing right now?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 47718, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Life is like Tetris (Noah Rasheta)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564494016, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cjbdjl/life_is_like_tetris_noah_rasheta/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DadaBhagwan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_qpfwq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564407096, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cjba2z/adjust_everywhere_key_to_happiness/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cjba2z", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cjba2z/adjust_everywhere_key_to_happiness/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564407098, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 47719, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Adjust Everywhere - Key To Happiness", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564493481, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cjba2z/adjust_everywhere_key_to_happiness/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Trustheuniverse9", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_425o8g22", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564405706, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cjb0vk/any_moon_signs_having_trouble_sleeping_this/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cjb0vk", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cjb0vk/any_moon_signs_having_trouble_sleeping_this/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564405707, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 47715, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Any moon signs having trouble sleeping this passed week?

I can let strangers be, in whichever way they chose.  I know most of us have unresolved trauma spilling over into every aspect of how we think and see the world.  Its easy to get lost in these false lenses.  I've also been trying to improve my mind body and spirit the last couple years so I'm definitely on a bit of a journey.  And what I mean by that is that I am actively seeking growth.  Now I'm no sage that in every opportunity can smile, offer kind words and even if an asshole is blowing smoke in my face, moves along pleasantly because I've reached buddhahood...lets not exaggerate here.  But I've made many steps towards healing my human experience and trying to return to my true self.  Not everybody is thirsty for growth, as it often requires diving head first into parts of our hearts we've ignored for years due to the triggering pain and sadness that rushes thru our body when we are forced to deal and process some painful segments of our lives.  I can understand how difficult that is with most, and especially how hard its been for me.  \n\nBut all that applies to people in general.  Its hard for me to allow others I love to simply continue on without any healing.  And I know, this is MY path, not theirs.  But their trauma and their judgments and their victim mentality that we all receive....it truly does require uninstalling to be honestly happy.... or at the very least a hard firm look at ourselves, and some people require the vision to look at self with an objective eye.  And of course if that view comes from me, well, that's merely how I look at it.  It cannot be detached from my being as divine truth, so much as it is just me being on my bullshit again.  If truth comes out of my mouth, since its come out of my mouth, it is reduced to my opinion.  Because I spoke it.  But there are universal truths that remain unbent regardless who speaks it.  But that can only be heard by those who truly listen.  When people aren't ready for these realities they resist like they're on their last leg in war and about to be taken in as prisoners.  The fight or flight response is amplified and there's no listening.  I understand.  It's their path.  They don't understand yet.\n\nThese walls and blockages truly do build a barrier between us tho....but I understand that the reason everybody is exactly how they are IS because life is varied and beautiful.  I am but one color in the human spectrum and its not fair if I try to paint the other colors with my particular shade because its helped me the most.  Obviously its my favorite!  It doesn't mean its the best.  But how, can I allow others to be when the other is my girlfriend and we are constantly bickering and finding it very difficult to be alone with each other without arguing because we are at two different levels of healing.  Of course we began at two VERY different levels of trauma....the things she's been thru I could not imagine how I would have even survived them...and her coping mechanisms are layered and rooted and much more complex than mine every had to be.  Here I sit, reading my own words, feeling like a privileged piece of shit for even taking the time to type our comparisons.  Over her life she's built many walls over her heart for protection.  I do my best to encourage healing, but these conversations are very heavy hearted and often end up in a disagreement of perspective and her protective anger taking control of the conversation out of a defensive coping mechanism.  I must respect her path.  But here I am trying to heal her.  Knowing only she can truly heal herself.  Maybe with my help.  But first she must want it.  Just as I want growth for myself, and our future, it cannot be forced upon anyone.  She must want it too.  But damn.  That means....that means....we may not make it.

I'm silently starting to realize I cannot run from this (unfortunately).\n\nSo 2 weeks ago I got this terrible headache.   As I have the gift of 'knowing' things I figured out my SO was causing this.   I went to 'my' spiritual friend last Wednesday and she got rid of the headache.  A few hours later I became so sick ... it was really hard.  Nausea, terrible migraine, I could barely stand.  5 minutes later I heard my SO arriving and I knew they got me again.  I asked my SO to see my spiritual friend and they met on Friday at 5pm.  At 5.15 pm my headache went away.  It was a really  weird experience, it was gone in a snap.  So at the moment I still have this lingering headache.  It's not nearly as bad as it was, but it's very annoying and makes work quite difficult.\n\nI made a decision this weekend.  I do not want to rely on others to clean up the mess.   The only problem I'm facing is that I do not have a clue how things work.  My friend gave me some prayers and although I'm not (very) religious I gave it a try this weekend.  Of course when I was saying the prayers I 'felt' it, I know it's the path I should follow.  I just have to convince myself to actually do it .  I still have a headache and it would be a victory if I could remove it.\n\nSo any books I should read, any other tips on how to understand things?   I'm very aware of things, my friend spiritually visited me on Thursday while I was working and I felt her.  I even sent her \"thank you\" text :)  I know all these things and I know there are chakras but that's how far my knowledge go.\n\nThank you for any help!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 47681, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How can I remove bad energy?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564478648, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cj8vbm/how_can_i_remove_bad_energy/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "titsludge", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4949wjuu", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564391578, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cj8row/i_am_the_antichrist/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cj8row", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "d1c17098-66c1-11e9-9077-0ed15a315736", "link_flair_text": "r/occult", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cj8row/i_am_the_antichrist/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "2mMWpkmJ-TlFnSh7T4qf6SNX3ounIvrCUHcIl7PJn44", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/W4ni4Xxd8M-GyKK2TIhaOeQ6UhG__3NvNDUs2ugPomU.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7740ab9ed92d40de38a05822cb686fa76aab766", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/W4ni4Xxd8M-GyKK2TIhaOeQ6UhG__3NvNDUs2ugPomU.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11e275e53443b5b966976d3b23aac2d6e6460bab", "width": 216}, {"height": 168, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/W4ni4Xxd8M-GyKK2TIhaOeQ6UhG__3NvNDUs2ugPomU.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb6e5a1f15b5258d033594fa5176c154ea38eafd", "width": 320}, {"height": 336, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/W4ni4Xxd8M-GyKK2TIhaOeQ6UhG__3NvNDUs2ugPomU.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cc8d8f8cde1a634e40c8e6d3546e4dffa6f82ab", "width": 640}, {"height": 504, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/W4ni4Xxd8M-GyKK2TIhaOeQ6UhG__3NvNDUs2ugPomU.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db36e59850f05faf997f04106b948d773947bf6c", "width": 960}, {"height": 567, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/W4ni4Xxd8M-GyKK2TIhaOeQ6UhG__3NvNDUs2ugPomU.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6280cbc010c01456348ed1ad96ff2a7ea2b12a3", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 630, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/W4ni4Xxd8M-GyKK2TIhaOeQ6UhG__3NvNDUs2ugPomU.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=ca60ae4ab08a9c8d83bcac39d598f26a722f8e18", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1564391579, "score": 0, "selftext": "I wrote this paper within a good full night of writing.

And since they do not believe in authority, they are very impudent. This is due to illusion caused by accumulating some wealth and false prestige. Sometimes such demons take up the role of preacher, mislead the people, and become known as religious reformers or as incarnations of God. They make a show of performing sacrifices, or they worship the demigods, or manufacture their own God. Common men advertise them as God and worship them, and by the foolish they are considered advanced in the principles of religion, or in the principles of spiritual knowledge. They take the dress of the renounced order of life and engage in all nonsense in that dress. Actually there are so many restrictions for one who has renounced this world. The demons, however, do not care for such restrictions. They think that whatever path one can create is one's own path; there is no such thing as a standard path one has to follow. The word avidhi-p\u016brvakam, meaning disregard for the rules and regulations, is especially stressed here. These things are always due to ignorance and illusion.\n\n**Question 1 : Why the demoniacs are always impudent ? Why emphasis is given to the word avidhi-p\u016brvakam in this verse ?**\n\n[ ](https://www.facebook.com/bhagavadgitaclass/photos/a.490569474335309/2478026692256234/?type=3&amp;theater#)Re**lated Pic

Some of these interactions get so heated that we almost get in a fight.\n  \nSo than I'll ignore this person, but than they'll come back in my life pretending that NOTHING happend. Even though they said something as rude as \"your girlfriend doesn't love you\" which may have led to a violent fight.\n  \nHow do I avoid or send the message to these type of people to screw off?

Mr. \\[1662\\] and Mrs. \\[1661\\].\n\nR E A D I N G\n\nTime of Reading 3:45 to 4:15 P. M. Eastern Standard Time. \u2026, Penna.\n\n1. HLC: You will have before you the body and enquiring mind of \\[2475\\], \u2026, Penna., in special reference to the Yoga exercises with which he has been experimenting, in breathing. You will indicate just what has taken place in the body and what should be done from this point, considering the best physical, mental and spiritual development of the entity. You will answer the questions, as I ask them:\n\n2. EC: Yes, we have the body, the enquiring mind, \\[2475\\]; and those conditions, those experiences of the body in the use of Yoga exercise in breathing.\n\n3. To give that as would be helpful to the body at this time, there might be indicated for the body something of that which takes place when such exercises are used \u2013 and the experiences had by one so doing.\n\n4. These exercises are excellent, yet it is necessary that special preparation be made \u2013 or that a perfect understanding be had by the body as to what takes place when such exercises are used.\n\n5. For, BREATH is the basis of the living organism's activity. Thus, such exercises may be beneficial or detrimental in their effect upon a body.\n\n6. Hence it is necessary that an understanding be had as to how, as to when, or in what manner such may be used.\n\n7. It would be very well for the body to study very carefully the information which we have given through these sources as respecting Meditation. Then this information as may be given here may prove of beneficial effect in the experience of the body.\n\n8. Each soul, individual or entity, finds these facts existent:\n\n9. There is the body-physical \u2013 with all its attributes for the functioning of the body in a three-dimensional or a manifested earth plane.\n\n10. Also there is the body-mental \u2013 which is that directing influence of the physical, the mental and the spiritual emotions and manifestations of the body; or the way, the manner in which conduct is related to self, to individuals, as well as to things, conditions and circumstances. While the mind may not be seen by the physical senses, it can be sensed by others; that is, others may sense the conclusions that have been drawn by the body-mind of an individual, by the manner in which such an individual conducts himself in relationship to things, conditions or people.\n\n11. Then there is the body-spiritual, or soul-body \u2013 that eternal something that is invisible. It is only visible to that consciousness in which the individual entity in patience becomes aware of its relationship to the mental and the physical being.\n\n12. All of these then are one \u2013 in an entity; just as it is considered, realized or acknowledged that the body, mind and soul are one, \u2013 that God, the Son and the Holy Spirit are one.\n\n13. Then in the physical body there ARE those influences, then, through which each of these phases of an entity may or does become an active influence.\n\n14. There may be brought about an awareness of this by the exercising of the mind, through the manner of directing the breathing.\n\n15. For, in the body there is that center in which the soul is expressive, creative in its nature, \u2013 the Leydig center.\n\n16. By this breathing, this may be made to expand \u2013 as it moves along the path that is taken in its first inception, at conception, and opens the seven centers of the body that radiate or are active upon the organisms of the body.\n\n17. This in its direction may be held or made to be a helpful influence for specific conditions, at times \u2013 by those who have taught, or who through experience have found as it were the key, or that which one may do and yet must not do; owing to whatever preparation has been made or may be made by the body for the use of this ability, this expression through the body-forces.\n\n18. As this life-force is expanded, it moves first from the Leydig center through the adrenals, in what may be termed an upward trend, to the pineal and to the centers in control of the emotions \u2013 or reflexes through the nerve forces of the body.\n\n19. Thus an entity puts itself, through such an activity, into association or in conjunction with all it has EVER been or may be. For, it loosens the physical consciousness to the universal consciousness.\n\n20. To allow self in a universal state to be controlled, or to be dominated, may become harmful.\n\n21. But to know, to feel, to comprehend as to WHO or as to WHAT is the directing influence when the self-consciousness has been released and the real ego allowed to rise to expression, is to be in that state of the universal consciousness, \u2013 which is indicated in this body here, Edgar Cayce, through which there is given this interpretation for \\[2475\\].\n\n22. So, in analyzing all this, \u2013 first study the variations of what has been the body-temperament, in thought, in food. For, the body-physical becomes that which it assimilates from material nature. The body-mental becomes that it assimilates from both the physical-mental and the spiritual-mental. The soul is ALL of that the entity is, has been or may be.\n\n23. Then, WHO and WHAT would the entity have to direct self in such experiences?\n\n24. To be loosed without a governor, or a director, may easily become harmful.\n\n25. But as we would give, from here, let not such a director be that of an entity. Rather so surround self with the universal consciousness of the CHRIST, as to be directed by that influence as may be committed to thee.\n\n26. Thus the entity may use constructively that which has been attained.\n\n27. But to prevent physical harm, mental harm, \u2013 attune self in body and in mind with that influence by which the entity seeks to be directed; not haphazardly, not by chance, but \u2013 as of old \u2013 choose thou this day WHOM ye will serve: the living God within thee, by thee, through thee? or those influences of knowledge without wisdom, that would enslave or empower thee with the material things which only gratify for the moment?\n\n28. Rather choose thou as he of old, \u2013 let others do as they may, but as for thee, serve thou the living God.\n\n29. Thus ye may constructively use that ability of spiritual attunement, which is the birthright of each soul; ye may use it as a helpful influence in thy experiences in the earth.\n\n30. But make haste SLOWLY! Prepare the body. Prepare the mind, before ye attempt to loosen it in such measures or manners that it may be taken hold upon by those influences which constantly seek expressions of self rather than of a living, constructive influence of a CRUCIFIED Savior.\n\n31. Then, crucify desire in self; that ye may be awakened to the real abilities of helpfulness that lie within thy grasp.\n\n32. Ready for questions.\n\n33. (Q) Is there at present any danger to any particular body-function, such as sex; or to general health?  \n(A) As we have indicated, without preparation, desires of EVERY nature may become so accentuated as to destroy \u2013 or to overexercise as to bring detrimental forces; unless the desire and purpose is acknowledged and set IN the influence of self as to its direction \u2013 when loosened by the kundaline activities through the body.\n\n34. (Q) Just what preparation would you advise for the body, now?  \n(A) This should be rather the choice of the body from its OWN development, than from what ANY other individual entity or source might give.\n\nPurify the body, purify the mind; that the principle, the choice of ideals as made by the entity may be made manifest.\n\nDo whatever is required for this, \u2013 whether the washing of the body, the surrounding with this or that influence, or that of whatever nature.\n\nAs has been experienced, this opening of the centers or the raising of the life force may be brought about by certain characters of breathing, \u2013 for, as indicated, the breath is power in itself; and this power may be directed to certain portions of the body. But for what purpose? As yet it has been only to see what will happen! Remember what curiosity did to the cat! Remember what curiosity did to Galileo, and what it did to Watt \u2013 but they used it in quite different directions in each case!\n\n35. (Q) Considering the development of the entity, is further practice of the Yoga exercises of breathing and meditation recommended?  \n(A) By all means! if and when, and ONLY when, preparation has been made; and when there is the knowledge, the understanding and the wisdom as to what to do WITH that gained! Without such, do not undertake same!\n\n36.

I keep feeling that there is something \"more\" that I am missing. I have been in a relationship with Harry for 4 years now, whom is complete atheist, and although he says that he supports me and everyone is different he will refer to my Crystal's as wasting money on \"rocks\" and kinda make me feel weird I guess. I mean he is a good guy to me, will loan me money whenever needed also will pay for a lot of things(I know materialistic things).\n\nHe will cook for me usually although it is a lot less now and more ordering out. He says that he loves me but will not come for walks to work on his health, will not go to the gym on his own and will never initiate sex. For context we are in our late 20s. I will initiate sometimes leading to sex 2-4 times a month but I haven't orgasmed in a while. Mostly due to the lack of connection.  I'm not sure if he is trying more and I'm just not seeing it because I'm choosing not too? Im going crazy making up excuses and I'm not sure why. Usually I will go to bed 10-10:30ish and he will stay up playing video games... when we do go to bed we are back to back on our phones (which I hate and have voiced but nothing changes). I know I am not perfect but I need connection in my life... Am I reaching for something that is not there due to my growth in spirituality? Do we have differ vaules? Do I need to try more? \n\nJust for example....\n\nThursday night I told him that I feel that he cannot say no to his friends and that they always peer pressure him into drinking and I dont think that is going to change ever even if a baby is involved (we plan(ned) to have children) ... and he claims that he loves me more than his friends and that it would change because his brother did... he asked \"you want me to get rid of my friends is that it?\" In a laughing matter and I said \"No that is not in my hands I dont make choices for him.\" And the convo went on for a bit but no fighting was had.\n\nThen its Friday and we usually have game night with 2 other friends, my gf is usually left by 1030. I still had packing to do(flying to hometown for a week without harry). So Harry invites the usual friend over but proceeds to invite 3 more buddies to have a few beers.... the usual game night friends were gone by 1030) and instead of Harry spending this last bit of time together he drinks with his buddies who he will have a whole week to drink with... this kinda set me off and I felt like crying as I hoped he would have wanted to spend sometime with me helping me pack or even talking to me while I did so... I dont know. I'm not happy is all I know.

Not just the thing that \u201cyou think you want to do\u201d, but something that is truly vital and present and trying to emerge in most all of what you already do. \n\nI\u2019ve put together a few questions and thoughts I\u2019ve come to about it and I\u2019d like to share them. These are by no means \u201crules\u201d \u2014 just tools and ideas I\u2019ve used that seem helpful. \n\nAlso, if anyone has additional methods, please share them!\n\nI find that purpose is often not a specific occupation but more like a way of being or a core energy you want to express. So a purpose isn\u2019t to be a doctor; it\u2019s to heal. The purpose isn\u2019t to be a painter, it\u2019s to create. The purpose isn\u2019t to be a mother, it\u2019s to love and nurture. Something like that. Once you tune into the core state of being that is most meaningful to you, you may find there are dozens of ways to pursue it in your life. \n\n1) What would you do if you couldn\u2019t fail? (My favorite question. Really spend time of this)\n2) What would you do if you had $50m in the bank?\n3) What would you do if you had a year to live?\n\nA test for whether you\u2019ve identified your life purpose: imagine you sit down with someone who can magically know the future. You tell them what you believe your purpose is and they check their crystal ball (or whatever) and tell you, \u201cokay, congratulations, if you follow that path you will get to the full manifestation of the dream coming true... but it\u2019s going to take 30 years of pursuit before it fully blossoms.\u201d \nDo you still want to do it?\n\nSome commonalities I notice from people after they have identified their purpose:\n\n1) somehow they\u2019ve always known \n2) ties in to both their biggest internal conflicts and their biggest dreams \n3) makes them well-up with emotion just thinking or talking about it \n4) it\u2019s something that shows up in many ways in their lives\n5) it\u2019s something they first want to explore themselves and often, at later stages, would want to help others attain\n\n\nOnce again, these are not rules, these are just helpful things that can get the ball rolling.

They do not believe in life after death, and they do not believe that one takes on different types of bodies according to one's karma, or activities in this world.\"  \n\"The demoniac person, who has no faith in God or the Supersoul within himself, performs all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratification. He does not know that there is a witness sitting within his heart. The Supersoul is observing the activities of the individual soul. As it is stated in the Vedic literature, theUpani\u1e63ads, there are two birds sitting in one tree; the one is acting and enjoying or suffering the fruits of the branches, and the other is witnessing. But one who is demoniac has no knowledge of Vedic scripture, nor has he any faith; therefore he feels free to do anything for sense enjoyment, regardless of the consequences.\"  \n**Ref :

There is no other way to provide health and vitality than through red blood.\n\nProtein from organs and muscle is made of red blood. Protein is what absorbs excess heat and disperses it. Drawing it out slowly without overheating. The more dense muscle you have the more heat you can quickly contain and expell.\n\nIf you have a piece of organic grass fed prime meat in your possession you are as rich as Bill Gates (Bull gates).\n\nRed meat is the original bandage/wrap. Amywhere that is overheating can be applied with raw protein. Pork is closest to our DNA but human meat would be best naturally. The organisation of the meat protein strands are designed with the entire organism. They contain the holographic heat index which the elements play around with to create the organs and muscles.\n\nMatch up a perfect heat index and you heal the entire organ fast. Eat a heart and your heart will diffuse excess heat and draw in heat giving it metabolism. Burning toxins and fat and damaged cells and cancer away. And withdrawing to a cold state where the body places new corresponsing proteins in to the structure. Next to test the new addition increase heat. Whatever burns away is not suitable.\n\nThe body can only modify so much protein from animals in to human dna and it takes energy deficit to do it so you have to consume fat which slows down the metabolism so the body can work on the proteins before the next cycle is completed. \n\nHowever if you eat human meat from a healthy child for instance. It is perfect. It hits the blood and the metabolism roars in to operation. All the proteins get directly linked to corresponding organs. If the person had the same DNA aka family it is like you ate more of yourself. Giving you the fastest healing physically possible reversing your age by years.\n\nThis is why Queen Elizabeth sacrificed her children to eat them. And why jeffrey Epstein and the illuminati run child smuggling routes to secret islands. It is the oldest human tradition dating to original man. Tribes would battle to consume their enemies.

That is unlimited. He only thinks how much assessment he has just now and schemes to engage that stock of wealth farther and farther. For that reason, he does not hesitate to act in any sinful way and so deals in the black market for illegal gratification. He is enamoured by the possessions he has already, such as land, family, house and bank balance, and he is always planning to improve them. He believes in his own strength, and he does not know that whatever he is gaining is due to his past good deeds. He is given an opportunity to accumulate such things, but he has no conception of past causes. He simply thinks that all his mass of wealth is due to his own endeavor. A demoniac person believes in the strength of his personal work, not in the law of karma.According to the law of karma, a man takes his birth in a high family, or becomes rich, or very well educated, or very beautiful because of good work in the past. The demoniac thinks that all these things are accidental and due to the strength of his personal ability. He does not sense any arrangement behind all the varieties of people, beauty, and education. Anyone who comes into competition with such a demoniac man is his enemy. There are many demoniac people, and each is enemy to the others. This enmity becomes more and more deep-between persons, then between families, then between societies, and at last between nations. Therefore there is constant strife, war and enmity all over the world.\n\nEach demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacrifice of all others. Generally, a demoniac person thinks of himself as the Supreme God, and a demoniac preacher tells his followers: \"Why are you seeking God elsewhere? You are all yourselves God! Whatever you like, you can do. Don't believe in God. Throw away God. God is dead.\" These are the demoniac's preachings.\n\nAlthough the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential, or even more so, he thinks that no one is richer than him and that no one is more influential than him. As far as promotion to the higher planetary system is concerned, he does not believe in performing yaj\u00f1as or sacrifices. Demons think that they will manufacture their own process of yaj\u00f1aand prepare some machine, by which they will be able to reach any higher planet. The best example of such a demoniac man was R\u0101va\u1e47a. He offered a program to the people by which he would prepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the heavenly planets without performing sacrifices, such as are prescribed in the Vedas. Similarly, in the present age such demoniac men are striving to reach the higher planetary systems by mechanical arrangement. These are examples of bewilderment. The result is that, without their knowledge, they are gliding toward hell. Here the Sanskrit word mohaj\u0101la is very significant. J\u0101la means net; like fishes caught in a net, they have no way to come out.\n\n**Question 1 : Why there is constant strife, war and enmity all over the world ?**\n\n**Question 2 : What example has been given in this verse to explain the demoniac mentality ?**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/16](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/16)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 47458, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 16.16", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564393113, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cityp8/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1616/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bastavar", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1s280jym", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564303080, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/citj67/a_life_stark_and_dark/", "gildings": {}, "id": "citj67", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/citj67/a_life_stark_and_dark/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "InlderGiy9Ko6PMxTEF0HVF3yQRgXpLLLnoF2UeCjxU", "resolutions": [{"height": 72, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ceOdvRX_Bf50iYVjLz7YeL6iY_bZoYvNwnyJ9b5lPuk.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b66ee061062b1200a1f3cb16a8944ed22e03d8d3", "width": 108}, {"height": 144, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ceOdvRX_Bf50iYVjLz7YeL6iY_bZoYvNwnyJ9b5lPuk.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08e91643539c8669fb90f209f07a434702556ab4", "width": 216}, {"height": 213, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ceOdvRX_Bf50iYVjLz7YeL6iY_bZoYvNwnyJ9b5lPuk.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ba028548861af0ad99ea9d0a74d4a997ba75d5e", "width": 320}, {"height": 426, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ceOdvRX_Bf50iYVjLz7YeL6iY_bZoYvNwnyJ9b5lPuk.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c0847f77a6e6e49d2c1b9f5455d8b89faa0017b", "width": 640}, {"height": 640, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ceOdvRX_Bf50iYVjLz7YeL6iY_bZoYvNwnyJ9b5lPuk.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27185862e02fca2bd1ba97d778408ad31f53843a", "width": 960}], "source": {"height": 640, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ceOdvRX_Bf50iYVjLz7YeL6iY_bZoYvNwnyJ9b5lPuk.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=1f993fa947bd586a879875afc62dbb4a1e8c5d76", "width": 960}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1564303080, "score": 3, "selftext": "The life may be dark and stark.

respiratory process, while recognising the connection between your breath, your mind, and your emotions.\n\nYour breath is a life force extension, by utilising breathing techniques, not only does your body being to rejuvenate, but also extends your life itself.\n\nI highly recommend integrating a daily yoga routine, even if it is just simple stretches, it will make you feel good, I promise.\n\nThe importance of developing your breath now might seem unusual, but depending on your method of introducing the DMT into your system, Vaping (as a great option) it will require that you can handle 3 full lungs. \n\nChris explains it succinctly here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Here's what I can tell you as a first timer.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You will be rightfully petrified when the time comes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Time = 0: After one lung full vapor you will be flushed with a feeling of having been given an incredibly benign tranquilizer. Expect this and do not fear giving in to it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Time = 20 seconds: At the end of the second lung full you will enter what you will recognize as an extremely psychedelic state. Again, the critical thing to do is give in to the experience, because this will not harm you in any way. Fighting against the experience is totally counterproductive, and you almost certainly won't do it, but sometimes first timers are so overwhelmed by the newness of the situation that they feel as though they've been lead into a trap of some sort. There is no trap. \"Reality\" is the trap and you'll be glad you escaped it for a few moments.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Time = 60 seconds: At the exhalation of your **third** lung full of vapor you will break through to the larger dimension in which entities become apparent. You will be overwhelmed and amazed beyond anything that anyone can imagine during ordinary states of consciousness. I have gone through the experience many, many times and it is still an extremely difficult task to remember exactly what happens.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Time = 360 seconds: you will be largely back to everyday reality.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Time = 600 seconds: you can go about your day as if nothing whatsoever happened, except that you are infinitely wiser than at Time = 0.\n\n\\- Sage Chris Cantelmo\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this stage you may be thinking that this all seems like a lot of work. \n\nSo I will provide a teaser of what to expect if you can continue on the path. \n\nI promise by completing these 8 days and by beginning your first DMT experience you will have merged your point of focus and transcend the Self-altogether.

The info is found in the Channeled by Jesus book \u201cWay Of Mastery.\u201d It explains how a love aura leads to success while a fear aura leads to failure and how to measure it. Fear causes constriction. Love causes expansion. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe body itself is constantly receiving input in the form of subtle energy vibration from everything and everyone around it. You are like a giant radio station that is picking up and transmitting signals constantly. \n\nIf you would like proof of this, and especially if you would like proof of how powerful thought is as it expresses vibration through the body, simply create what you call in your world dowsing rods. Take two pieces of metal. It could be two parts of a coat hanger. Bend them so that you can gently hold one end, and hold them in your hands about six inches from your body. \n\nThen have a friend stand about twenty feet away and have them think thoughts of negativity, such as, \u201cI am unworthy. I am not worthy of being loved. I have no energy. I\u2019m not worth anything.\u201d As they are doing that, walk toward them and see how close you get before your dowsing rods of metal begin to move around. \n\nThen, back up and find just the edge where their energy field is influencing the rods. Then back up about twenty or thirty feet, and have them change their mind. Have them begin to think loving thoughts, such as, \u201cI am one with God. Love flows through me perfectly. I am so glad to be alive!\u201d They need not say it out loud. They need not move a muscle. They need only think differently. Then again walk toward them, and see when you find the point where the rods in your hands begin to move about. You will find that their energy field is much larger with the positive thought than with the negative thought. \n\nNow, your body is like a divining rod. And so is everyone else\u2019s. Therefore, those with confidence, those who love themselves, those who are not concerned with the good opinions of the world, who just go forward in the direction of what they love, are the ones that seem to gain the greatest support in the universe.\n\nWhy? Because when such a one walks into a bank to get a business loan, already knowing that this is a great idea and they are going to bring the fullness of their being to it, and that they could not possibly fail, by just walking in the door they are bringing an energy field that influences and touches the loan officer. \n\nThose that walk in thinking, \u201cGod, I wish I could get this business loan, but I just don\u2019t know; I don\u2019t have any experience in this; and they\u2019re going to look at me like I\u2019m a jerk,\u201d walk in with a much reduced energy field. It is very weak. The quality of vibration of the thought is emanating out and touching the energy field of the loan officer. If you were the loan officer, whom would you rather do business with? \n\nTherefore, when Love leads the way, when Love is the field of energy that you are abiding within, everywhere you go, you are touching the universe in a way that is much more subtle than the conscious mind. And the universe will respond to you, because Love responds to itself like a flower that opens to sunlight. \n\nNow, I am not telling you anything you do not already know. But you have not stopped to consider how profoundly important it is in the nature of your own life. \n\nYou know that you respond to a happy person, to a kind person, to a loving person more than you would to a person who is being wicked. It is simple common sense. You know that you love to be around beings that talk about unlimitedness, that talk about great vision. Why? Because they are reminding you that you too are a great visionary, that unlimitedness is the natural state of the Kingdom of Heaven. \n\nThe problem is that you have unwittingly taught yourself to live from fear, to think negative thoughts, to believe that the opinions of the world mean something. You have literally created a world in which people are negatively minded, do not want to support you, and do not think you are worth anything. Yet, you are the one that is projecting that belief about yourself. And you, therefore, will attract a like vibration. For like attracts like. \n\nIf you, therefore, want to attract beings who will support you and love you, decide to be a being who supports and loves yourself. Decide to open your arms wide, as we spoke of in the last lesson, to receive the Love, the presence and the pleasure of God\u2019s presence. \n\nThink only loving thoughts. Learn to master forgiveness. Dare to follow your heart! Celebrate life! Do what brings you joy! Walk as one confident in the Light of Christ! Dare to look out upon the world and say: \n\nMy Father has set the table before me, and every being and blade of grass is here to support my enjoyment of God! \n\nAs you cultivate that kind of discipline, your life will change, as it must. For the universe responds to the vibrational quality that you are emitting from the radio station of your own mind. \n\nBeloved friends, you are, indeed, Love. But when you decide as you get up in your day, that you must fear the attitude of the boss, that you must safeguard the feelings of the spouse, that you must sacrifice in order to be conformed to the opinions of the world, you shrink your energy field. \n\nAnd the only thing that leaks out is something like the statement, \u201cI choose to live in fear. I\u2019m not willing to be bold and big and happy. I don\u2019t want to laugh too much today because somebody might be offended. I won\u2019t tell you my truth because it might disrupt your energy field.\u201d\n\nAll of that is delusion. You are free. You are here to celebrate. You are here to be outrageous. You are here to extend Love, and Love cannot be extended through a contracted energy field. \n\nTherefore, teach yourself to notice each fearful thought. Teach yourself to notice when your energy field is contracted, and do the opposite: Choose to receive Love!

I, personally, believe the connection between soul and ego is enhanced (or maybe even maximized) when the ego follows the soul and not the other way around. \n\nFor example, if your soul leads you towards making music, you can allow the ego to start toying with the idea that you\u2019re a musician and that you do this and that and etc. \n\nOn the other side, you\u2019ll have situations where the soul follows the ego, and in these situations you become stuck and miserable. The ego would like to become a politician for the whole image aspect of it. The soul is not involved in the situation; there is nothing of the soul saying: \u201cI want to help people improve their lifestyle\u201d or any sense of the heart\u2019s desire. Instead, the soul takes the back seat and the ego takes the driving wheel. This is why the ego can hurt you very bad.\n\nThe ego isn\u2019t bad; perhaps, it\u2019s healthy when you\u2019re aware of what\u2019s an egoistic desire and what is a heart\u2019s desire.

Thus there is no end to their anxiety. Being bound by hundreds and thousands of desires, by lust and anger, they secure money by illegal means for sense gratification.**\n\n**16.13-15: The demoniac person thinks: \"So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the future, more and more. He is my enemy, and I have killed him; and my other enemy will also be killed. I am the lord of everything, I am the enjoyer, I am perfect, powerful and happy. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives. There is none so powerful and happy as I am. I shall perform sacrifices, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall rejoice.\" In this way, such persons are deluded by ignorance.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT(16.11-12)**\n\nThe demoniac accept that the enjoyment of the senses is the ultimate goal of life, and this concept they maintain until death. They do not believe in life after death, and they do not believe that one takes on different types of bodies according to one's karma, or activities in this world. Their plans for life are never finished, and they go on preparing plan after plan, all of which are never finished. We have personal experience of a person of such demoniac mentality, who, even at the point of death, was requesting the physician to prolong his life for four years more because his plans were not yet complete. Such foolish people do not know that a physician cannot prolong life even for a moment. When the notice is there, there is no consideration of the man's desire. The laws of nature do not allow a second beyond what one is destined to enjoy.The demoniac person, who has no faith in God or the Supersoul within himself, performs all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratification. He does not know that there is a witness sitting within his heart. The Supersoul is observing the activities of the individual soul. As it is stated in the Vedic literature, theUpani\u1e63ads, there are two birds sitting in one tree; the one is acting and enjoying or suffering the fruits of the branches, and the other is witnessing. But one who is demoniac has no knowledge of Vedic scripture, nor has he any faith; therefore he feels free to do anything for sense enjoyment, regardless of the consequences.\n\n**Question 1 : Why a demoniac person feels free to do anything for sense enjoyment, regardless of the consequences ?**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/11-15](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/11-15)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 47259, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 16.11-15", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564303848, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cif8qy/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_161115/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Milk_WZRD", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3zzvxqbc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564216048, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cif2lg/i_believe_my_former_friend_is_evil/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cif2lg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cif2lg/i_believe_my_former_friend_is_evil/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564216051, "score": 1, "selftext": "He\u2019s manipulative, judgmental, sexually deviant, cruel, and narcissistic.

So, I'll start off with a bit of information.\n\nI'm new on my spiritual path so I am still learning a lot about different energies and stuff. I kind of got into it because I was having a really hard time dealing with depression and anxiety. Because I have a heart condition, the doctor didn't want to give me any medication, so I started to really look into a more spiritual way of life to deal with my anxiety. I started off with buying a couple of crystals, and though I was sceptical and couldn't (and still can't!) *feel* the energy of them, I realised after a few weeks that I actually felt a lot more \"together\". In fact, it helped me clear my head enough to realise that my boyfriend was the main reason for the way I felt (didn't work, didn't help tidy up, didn't do anything but sit on his computer all day!), and I told him I was unhappy and he left.\n\nIt's been a few months now, and I haven't felt this good about myself for a long time. I managed to get some stuff done that I've been putting off for a long time, I'm learning to love myself more and to take time to meditate and learn more about a spiritual way of life. I started talking to my boyfriend again and we decided to try give things another go. He is still living with his mum, but comes and stays a few nights a week.\n\nSo, I've noticed that when my boyfriend is around, I feel myself getting out of balance. It's like my energy is slowly being drained. For example, I want to tidy up but it's like I don't know where to start and I just don't have the energy to do it. I want to, but I feel physically drained of energy. He still doesn't help out much when he comes around, although he is working now (only a couple of days a week and he complains about it constantly). I feel like he's the cause for sudden onset lethargy because when he's not here I don't tend to feel like that. \n\nHas anyone got any idea why this could be? And how can I protect myself against it? Its making me wonder if I should be with him or not, but we have a young child together and I really do want it to work between us, but I'm struggling to want to be with him at the moment because I feel so out of whack whenever he's around", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 47259, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is my boyfriend draining/affecting my energy?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564302220, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cif1m7/is_my_boyfriend_drainingaffecting_my_energy/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "RidiculouslyLost", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_48ryf3tv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564207557, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cidys1/clarity/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cidys1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cidys1/clarity/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564207559, "score": 1, "selftext": "I really felt the need to write this down, and for some reason I feel compelled to write it on here. Also, I apologize if everything seems jumbled but there\u2019s a lot that goes into this. So let\u2019s start from the beginning \n\nAs a young child, my father kicked my mother, baby sister, and 5 year old me out. He was abusive to my mother and was upset when she found out he was cheating on her. We moved in with my grandparents (mother\u2019s side) out of state. Ever since then my father was absent with very few appearances. The last time I saw him was in 5th grade when he came for one of his \u201cblue moon\u201dvisits, and became absusive with my mother over something I had done/said. \n\nWhen he finally stopped coming for visits all in all, his mother and sisters would still have us visit them. Well eventually they all stopped as well, except for his oldest sister. \n\nThroughout the years she made sure to keep contact with us, but in 2014 she and 3 other members of my family had all passed within 4 months of each other. As a child I was never exposed to death, so as a 19 year old I really had/have a hard time coping with their losses. Death actually became a reality to me for the first time. \n\nEver since then I have experienced panic attacks about 2-3 times a week at night time when my brain wants to continuously shout \u201cYou\u2019re going to die, There\u2019s no God\u201d which I have no idea where this all comes from. I myself am a believer (would say more on the agnostic perspective, but I believe). But we all know how our brains work sometimes. \n\nAfter my aunt passed, I now had no contact with anyone on my dad\u2019s side. Her husband (my uncle) even stopped returning my phone calls, but I chop it up to him mourning. \n\nThe beginning of this month I had one of the worst panic attacks that I had experienced in a long time. Where I had to ask all of my loved ones for a sign that there is something after this life. Something to assist me for when these thoughts come up.\n\nThe next day, I stumbled acrossed my aunts Obituary. So I took the time to remember her and thought about the times we spent together, her kindness, and the softness about her personality. Just as I was thinking about her, I got an email notification. I decided to check it and it was from my Ancestry account. It was notifying me of a \u201cpotential record in my family tree\u201d and it showed me a picture of her obituary.  I thought the coincidence was insane.\n\nTwo days later, I received a phone call from a number I haven\u2019t seen in over 5 years. It was my my Uncle calling me. He wanted to tell me that he had just visited my aunts grave the week before, and while he was there all he could think about was me and my sister. He felt the need to reach out.\n\nThen just a couple of days later my phone lights up again. It was Ancestry notifying me again of a \u201cpotential record match\u201d it was my aunts obituary once again. With my history of using ancestry I rarely get \u201crecord matches\u201d if any, and they never notify me of the same thing twice.\n\nMy heart is so full from this, yet it also so completely saddened. As a young boy going through a lot of pain from his father not being around, I did not appreciate my aunt as much as she deserved to be appreciated. Yet, even after her life with us ended, she still found a way to lift my head above the water. She answered my call and showed me that she still walks with me, even when I\u2019m too oblivious to notice.\n\nI know this post is incredibly long, and some parts may be pointless. But this particular week will forever be one of my most powerful spiritual moments.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 47249, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Clarity", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564293936, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cidys1/clarity/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "awarenessnow", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_152ig0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564207321, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cidxkf/life_as_ego_the_end_point_in_evolution/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cidxkf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cidxkf/life_as_ego_the_end_point_in_evolution/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564207322, "score": 11, "selftext": " \n\nSomehow at a young age, we humans begin to feel that we are separate, that we are individual entities, different from others, separate from life. Whether this psychological process of individuation is useful or not, positive or negative is not the point of this article. It happens. Apparently in all humans. But is individuation the end point? Many seem to assume so. Most likely however, individuation is not the end point. The psychological evolution of mankind has not ended, but has only just begun. Simply read the history books...\n\nWhat does it mean to live as an individual, as a person? Well we all know, but here is a fantasy story;\n\n\\~\n\n**&gt;&gt; the Two year old**\n\n*Warmth. Light. The smell of sea, the sand, the sense of wind stroking skin. Colours all around. There is playing with sand. There is the soft noise of the scoop entering the sand and digging. Voices. Voices of people. Children plunging in the water. Everything mixes into a timeless experiencing\u2026 Life is mysterious, unknown, open.*\n\n**&gt;&gt; the Shock**\n\n*Suddenly there is pain! Eyes are hurting! The strange taste of seawater mixed with sand and blood. There is toppling over, the whole world is turning! Confusion! Strange noises and sound! Crying! Intense pain! Panic!*\n\n**&gt;&gt; the Contraction**\n\n*Standing up. Still crying. The body is shaking with anger and fear. Primordial feelings arise: \u201cLife is not safe! Life and people can hurt me. I must defend myself or fight\u201d. I grab the scoop and hit back. It is beginning to get clear now. There is me and there is other!*\u00a0\n\n**&gt;&gt; the Adult**\n\n*Very important day today. Must make a good impression on the boss. This must work out. No, just relax. Don\u2019t worry. It will go fine. I am sitting here, waiting for the door to open, but soon he will ask me to come and enter his office. I wonder why he asked me to talk to him today? I hope he won\u2019t give me a hard time, like last year. What shall I do, if that happens again? Maybe I should just let him talk and ignore it. Oh no, wait. That did not work out well for me last time. I looked like a fool. I must take my stand and show him that I am the best one for this job. It\u2019s simple. I actually should be promoted to a better position. Really. My colleagues are not up to it. Though I must say that Mary Jane really is smart. Damn, what if she has already talked to him, before I did! I\u2019m a fool, I should have asked for promotion last month! O my god, what will happen if I don\u2019t get this job! I will have to sell my car. My wife will hate me. She already said that I am not making enough money and our house is too small, whereas her sister has just bought a second house in Italy! Damn, I\u2019m screwed if this does not work out! I am really in a tough situation! My heart is beating fast now. The door opens. There is my boss\u2026 I hope it goes well this time\u2026*\n\n**&gt;&gt; the Old man**\n\n*My life did not work out as I wanted. I should have made better decisions. My wife and children leaving me when I was in the highlight of my life has broken me. I should have stopped drinking after I got fired. Darn, I feel so unhappy and powerless. I can\u2019t change the past but at the same time I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. Maybe actually it was not my fault! My wife should have supported me and have helped me to quit drinking. If only she had done that. I am not to blame really. When she would have supported me during those hard times of losing my job, we would have been fine. But here I am. I did not get what I wanted to get in my life. It\u2019s OK to feel a bit depressed. Many people in my situation would feel that. Of course I feel bad. I wonder still though what would have happened if\u2026*\n\n\\~\n\nBecoming an individual (person) and finding our own way in life is perhaps a necessary step in our psychological development, but we are mistaken when we think that it is the last step and the only way to live\u2026 There are people who awaken out of this dream that there is a \u201cme entity\u201d who has a real past and a real future, has real problems to solve and is going to get and achieve things. (whether that is money, things, relationships or spiritual goals)\n\nCould the next step in human psychological evolution be the letting go of this belief in \u201cme\u201d as a central \"entity\"?\n\nOnly a few hundred years ago the commonly held belief in religion (and science) was that the entire universe including the sun revolved around the Earth and was specially created for certain humans who belonged to a specific religious group. In those times, to doubt or criticize this, meant punishment, prison or death. Now in the 21st century it is seen how ridiculous and limited that point of view was.\n\nPerhaps in similar fashion, it can be seen how ridiculous and limited the idea (belief) is that life revolves an actual \u201cme\u201d at its centre. The seeing of this illusion does not mean that life ends however. One can safely say that in a way, it is a whole new beginning, but not of anything or for anyone. The mind cannot grasp this. That is why it is Freedom and love.\n\nDo you see?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 47249, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Life as \"ego\" - the end point in evolution?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564293695, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cidxkf/life_as_ego_the_end_point_in_evolution/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "joliesse0x", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3thga4sg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564206911, "crosspost_parent": "t3_cidhiu", "crosspost_parent_list": [{"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "approved_at_utc": null, "approved_by": null, "archived": false, "author": "joliesse0x", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3thga4sg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "category": null, "clicked": false, "content_categories": null, "contest_mode": false, "created": 1564232914.0, "created_utc": 1564204114.0, "discussion_type": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Lightbulb", "downs": 0, "edited": 1564206215.0, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "hidden": false, "hide_score": true, "id": "cidhiu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "likes": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": null, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": null, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media": null, "media_embed": {}, "media_only": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_cidhiu", "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 1, "num_reports": null, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "permalink": "/r/Lightbulb/comments/cidhiu/theory_on_near_death_prebirth_experiences/", "pinned": false, "pwls": null, "quarantine": false, "removal_reason": null, "report_reasons": null, "saved": false, "score": 1, "secure_media": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I was thinking of the similarities between NDEs &amp; PBEs today and stumbled upon a theory.

But for the past 3 years, I've been in and out of it since finding out about \"new-age spirituality\".

I'm trying to give it one last strong push before I give up, but I keep imagining myself in other relationships because of it. \n\nI have voiced my concerns to him and he is and has always tried his best, but because of his mental illness, it's never enough. I love him dearly, but I increasingly feel like I hear whispers that we'd be better as friends.  And that maybe it's a karmic relationship? I don't know. *I'm looking for a sign or opinions, I suppose*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore importantly, I've also gotten into tarot, numerology, astrology, crystals, etc. and have found so many comforts that I feel like I'm levitating most days.

gone down, etc etc. sometimes i just don't feel like living.\n\ni guess that was more of a prelude to my actual question. i'm living with my girlfriend, and we're doing pretty okay at the moment, things are nice. however, there's one issue: we cannot connect at all spiritually. she's a christian that has become more in tune with her faith these past few months, which is great for her. i don't consider myself an atheist per se, but spirituality has never been for me. i cannot lie and say part of the way i was raised (parents were separated but kinda religious, they're more so spiritual now) impacts that. i just always found it easier to view the world through a more secular lens. point is, we know we're not going to last if we're not on the same type of spiritual plane. at the very least i just need to believe in some spiritual belief. i'm willing to try it again for her. i can't force something on myself that i know just *isn't me* but i can open my mind and try to find something out.\n\nso would anyone be able to help me find some spiritual (not religious) resources to get into that would be able to help me out with myself and my relationship?\n\nTL;DR: life been kinda eh

empathy. First I may say that I am 23 years old and male and I am HSP and empath. With that I do live with a lot of stigma being called a weakling or stuff.\n\nI have a lot of empathy and I mean a lot. I talked to many people about my empathy and they told me that it is a blessing. But I never experience it as a blessing more like a curse. An example my rabbit died a few days ago because of flys (she was infested with maggots). I was so mad at flys and I swatted one really aggressively like 5- 10 times until it was mush.\nI felt bad the whole evening for that, the poor fly did nothing to my rabbit and had to pay...\nI always safe small insects from drowning when they land in water.\nI feel horrible when people kill animals and insects for fun.\nI slowly start getting more vegetarian too...\nWhen I see crying people I have to cry too.\n\nFor me it is more like a curse than a blessing. Is there anyone feeling similar to that?\n\nHave a good weekend. \ud83d\ude0c", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 47108, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Having too much empathy?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564242034, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ci4g4v/having_too_much_empathy/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TheFutureOnes", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_47o06wos", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564153477, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ci3zjl/introducing_a_new_narrative_method_fieldperson/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ci3zjl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ci3zjl/introducing_a_new_narrative_method_fieldperson/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564153481, "score": 1, "selftext": "Greetings Human Hybrids!\n\nLet me make this direct and simple.\n\nThis post is authored by a member of a group of small of artists and theorists whom underwent a collective philosophical awakening.\n\nSubsequently, we cooperatively converted these realizations into twin books (parts 1 &amp; 2). Here, we excitedly present part-1... titled **Incessance**. This first part communicates these realizations through a new method of narration: *field*\\-*person perspective*. Until now, the first-person perspective has been almost uniformly used in conscious self-narration, which is tacitly directed toward an audience (the readers). Dualism between the first-person *character* and the *audience* covertly remains in effect. Within Incessance, as will become instantly apparent, the character and audience must merge, as would an operational player and it's structural display space. Indeed, this character-audience merger is exactly the methodological generalization that extends the first-person perceptual *panorama* ... into subconscious *fields* permeating every \u201cstate\u201d and \u201cmoment\u201d of the panorama with multiple potential states. Accordingly, perceptual (sensory) *structures* are everywhere enveloped by (directly unobservable yet telepathically inferential) symbolic *dynamics*. The field-person perspective effectively explodes the local linear, conscious perception of a first-person observer into a synergetically enveloping series of ambient cognitive (symbolic) images. Further details on the distinction between first-person and field-person are presented in the introduction to the book and are otherwise immediately apparent upon commencing the progression.\n\nThe main philosophical realizations of both books include:\n\n(a) The demonstrable existence and nonlinear symbolic dynamics of **telepathy**, including self-telepathy (in the form of deja vu and precognition).\n\n(b) The mathematical necessity of **God,** defined as the distributive algebraic identity of reality at large (including the physical universe as a codomain of a much richer mathematical metaverse). Accordingly, the \"pre-life\" and \"after-life\" both occur in the purely abstract metaphysical domain. This (b) realization redirects us to a true theory of metaphysics called the CTMU or Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe. As a note of clarity, the CTMU's author -- Christopher Langan -- is not a member of our group and I do not purport to represent him here.\n\n(c) The psychological cure for most, if not all, forms of **depression**. The cure is technically a many-valued logic that models the human body itself. This logic proves that, regardless of any body's deficiencies, disabilities, or dysfunctionality, a body's sensory and symbolic activities are INTRINSICALLY IMPORTANT to the cognitive-perceptual evolution of its physical sector of metaphysical reality).\n\nWe do understand the \"nutty\" nature of these statements. If you'd like the full submergence, email [incesancia@gmail.com](mailto:incesancia@gmail.com). We'll happily provide a free PDF copy of part 1 (Incessance). To anybody genuinely interested, we can also provide a free hard copy. We offer this first book (with the second well underway) as a gift for your awakening. Fundamentally, we love you.\n\nWe sincerely thank you for your attention.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 47099, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Introducing a new narrative method: field-person perspective.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564239866, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ci3zjl/introducing_a_new_narrative_method_fieldperson/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Beautiful_Disaster37", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1ydbise3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564151564, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ci3les/can_anyone_else_tell_me_if_these_coincidences_are/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ci3les", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 23, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ci3les/can_anyone_else_tell_me_if_these_coincidences_are/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564151565, "score": 32, "selftext": "Hi all :) Not too sure I've posted here before, I usually just use reddit to read and take in information. \n\n Been feeling lost/very lonely lately, in need of guidance, even just a simple sign to let me know I'm on the right path. I've been asking Spirit for a sign, even moreso begging my grandparents (who raised me and were the only family I've ever had or known, parents were never in the picture) to reach out and let me know they are with me and they're supporting me. **SO** \\- A few weeks ago I started noticing a lot of monarch butterflies (I've never noticed seeing actual monarchs more than once or twice a season) on my daily walks with my dogs. Literally 10-20 a walk... I walk my dogs 2x a day and walk a neighbors dog 1x a day. So I've been seeing A LOT. Was thinking \"cool, positive sign\" or what have you. Yesterday I had one actually fly up to me and land on me, fly around my body for a minute, and then fly away only to return and do the same exact thing prob 4x in abt 3-4 min. Next, I'm in my 'spot' in the woods I take my dogs to every morn, sitting on a rock and letting them do their thing sniffing around and what have you. I decided I wanted to meditate for even just a few min. As soon as I \"dropped in,\" my mind was pulled out by 1 of my dogs who is absolutely 'sensitive' in certain ways, he was quietly growling looking at absolutely nothing, but wagging his tail at the same time. Looking back at me wagging his tail and looking back at this one spot, growing just enough to hear it - kind of like he was a bit confused about what he was seeing or sensing or whatever... He is a beagle/golden ret. mix and his beagle nose always has him looking for and nosing out little animals. So I asked him \"what is it? what do you see? lets go over and see whats there\" and I went with him over to where he was looking at, thinking I'd have to hold the leash tight because he would prob find a chipmunk underneath a log or something. But he literally checked out the whole area, and nothing. He then started looking at the same spot again and just wagging his tail and doing his just 1 bark, he does that when hes just like \"hey! im excited!\" (barking once and just looking at me with his tail going). So I thought of the butterflies, and I said \"Pa &amp; Nana, if that was you guys, or one of you, PLEASE GIVE ME A SIGN so I know for sure it was you\" lo and behold, I saw about 7 dragonflies throughout the rest of the day, seeing the 1st almost immediately after asking for a sign. Before the walk was over I saw a Cardinal. (BTW- Dragonflies &amp; Cardinals were absolutely magical to my grandmother, she just LOVED them)\n\nCan I probably be sure these were definitely signs from my deceased loved ones?\n\nTLDR; Been feeling lost. Asked for my deceased grandparents to send me a sign that they are with me. Started seeing lots of monarch butterflies. Dog sees something in the woods while I'm meditating, but wasn't acting the same as if it was an animal or something. He acted like he didn't really know what it was, but was looking back and forth from me to one particular spot right near us, while wagging his tail and looking happy. Asked grandparents to send me a sign if that was them. I almost immediately saw a dragonfly (and about 6 more throughout day) and saw a Cardinal this day also. - Dragonflies &amp; Cardinals were my grandmothers absolute favorite animals (I'd almost say they were prob her spirit animals, she was into shamanism I THINK, judging by how things about her I didnt think about when I was that young) and she was mesmerized whenever she saw them.

I considered her a friend, but almost from the beginning I developed feelings that I couldn\u2019t quite understand. All I knew is that I liked her and I thought it was just a simple crush that I had developed. As I got to know her I fell deeper and deeper, even though we are completely different individuals, even though we have different opinions and lifestyles. I never saw a point in having feelings for this person because I never thought she would see me as anything more than a friend.  \n\nWe got a bit older and my feelings were still there and only worsening to be quite honest. I felt like I was burning from the inside out and I just wanted to burst out and tell her how I felt at times. But in her eyes I was this \u2018cool headed never shows emotion\u2019 person. She thought she was just another friend in my life that I interacted with because I needed someone to talk to. I know this because she told me this. During our free time we would love to debate and just test each other\u2019s opinions and belief system. And one topic she was adamant about was \u201csoul-mates\u201d. We could go on for hours and I would explain to her that there is no way in hell there is someone out there who is made only for you. I would tell her that it was a concept for the hopeless romantics and that you could find your \u201csoul-mate\u201d in anyone if you really wanted to. But she was so fascinated by this concept and said she wouldn\u2019t rest until she found this person. \n\nFast forward to now, we are actually in a relationship. How this came about you might be wondering? It\u2019s a long story...and this is already long enough. Anyway, I am still trying to understand how she developed feelings in the first place. I am by no means ANYTHING like her previous partners. We both thought we secretly hated each other but turns out it was the complete opposite. What I do know is that I have been in love with her longer than she has been in love with me. When I ask how her feelings came about she can only explain it by suddenly realizing her \u201cadmiration\u201d for me was more romantically than friendly. I can\u2019t say for sure if she is indeed \u201csoul-mate\u201d but it feels like it\u2019s supposed to happen. Could this be karmic, soul-mate?

shelter of insatiable lust, pride and false prestige, and being thus illusioned, are always sworn to unclean work, attracted by the impermanent.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe demoniac mentality is described here. The demons' lust is never satiated. They will go on increasing and increasing their insatiable desires for material enjoyment. Although they are always full of anxieties on account of accepting nonpermanent things, they still continue to engage in such activities out of illusion. They have no knowledge and cannot tell that they are heading the wrong way. Accepting nonpermanent things, such demoniac people create their own God, create their own hymns and chant accordingly. The result is that they become more and more attracted to two things-sex enjoyment and accumulation of material wealth. The word a\u015buci-vrat\u0101\u1e25, unclean vow, is very significant in this connection. Such demoniac people are only attracted by wine, women, gambling and meat eating; those are their a\u015buci, unclean habits. Induced by pride and false prestige, they create some principles of religion which are not approved by the Vedic injunctions. Although such demoniac people are most abominable in the world, still, by artificial means, the world creates a false honor for them. Although they are gliding toward hell, they consider themselves very much advanced.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the characteristics of a person with a demoniac mentality ?**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/10](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/10)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 47055, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 16.10", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564215704, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ci06qb/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1610/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lmtysamlife", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2v0cjlxk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564128079, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ci018n/seeing_number_46_repeatedly/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ci018n", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ci018n/seeing_number_46_repeatedly/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564128080, "score": 1, "selftext": " i smoked 2 joints ..when i look for the time its 11:46 . i started watching some trippy stuffs ... the next time i see the clock ..its 12:46 , then 1:46,2:46,3:46.....why am i seeing this number 46 again and again ??

Few people  know that an aura and a halo are quite different in their respective  natures, despite their close interconnection. No man can ever possess  both aura and halo completely developed at one and the same time.\n\n Like their respective shadows, every man, woman, child and baby has an  aura, but only a very few individuals have a halo in any of the varying  phases of its development, and still fewer possess a full halo. An aura  is the reflection of the emotions of an individual mind, just as any  physical thing possesses its shadow on the physical plane. The halo  begins to appear when the aura begins to disappear.\n\nThe  difference between a mental reflection (aura) and a physical shadow is  tremendous. Shadows depend upon their physical forms, but an individual  aura remains unaffected, even when the person concerned drops his  physical body. This is because, in spite of physical death, the  individual continues to possess the mind and the impressions in it, as  well as a subtle body which has a direct connection with the aura.\n\n Every action, significant or insignificant, intentional or  unintentional on the part of any person, creates relative impressions  (sanskaras ) which get imprinted on the mind of the individual, just as  sound is preserved on a phonograph record and images of light and shade  are caught on photographic film. As thought is the first direct medium  of expression of an impression \\[sanskara\\], a deep connection is  established between the thoughts and the impressions of an individual.\n\n An aura, therefore, is the mental reflection of the aggregate  impressions of thoughts and actions gathered by and stored in an  individual mind. As long as the impressions are there an aura is always  there, as an envelope of very fine atmosphere comprised of seven colors  which remain more or less prominent according to the nature of each  individual\u2019s impressions.\n\nNo two men are alike in all respects  and yet all have common physical features. Similarly, the aggregate of  individual impressions differ from one another, both quantitatively and  qualitatively, yet every aura is comprised of seven colors common to  all. These seven colors of an individual\u2019s aura represent the seven  principle categories, corresponding to the aggregate impressions of  each.\n\nThus, every individual aura is the image of a circle of  seven colors and each aura differs from the other in proportion to the  amount of each of the seven colors, according to the individual\u2019s  prominent mental impressions. For example, red would be the most  prominent color in the aura of a man whose impressions are predominantly  made up of lustful actions. Likewise, each aura also differs in the  color formation on the borders between every two prominent colors in it.\n\n The halo begins to develop and an aura begins to disappear only after  an individual starts advancing on the path to God-Realization. When the  aura begins to get more and more faint, the halo commences to shine more  and more, getting brighter in proportion to the progress of the  individual\u2019s consciousness on the path. The halo becomes very bright  only after an individual aura is on the point of disappearing. This  happens in the case of one who wakes up fully conscious in the sixth  plane of complete mental illumination.\n\nIn the Seventh Plane of  Reality, the God-Realized Being is, once and for all, entirely free from  each and every impression because the very storehouse of impressions  itself, the individual mind,  is then annihilated and there remains  neither aura nor halo. The Reality of God alone reigns supreme in  Self-Consciousness of infinite power, infinite knowledge and infinite  bliss, with all illusion ceasing to remain as illusion.\n\nWhen One  who is God-Realized is able to return with his God-Consciousness  simultaneously to all the planes of illusion as a Perfect Master  (Sadguru or Qutub), his halo is the most bright and infinitely brighter  than all the suns of the universe put together. It is out the question  for anyone, other than those who have attained the consciousness of the  sixth plane, to behold the divine effulgence of the Perfect Master\u2019s  halo.\n\nIn all other cases, the halo is an expression of individual  advancement of the path \\[subtle and mental planes\\] and a sign of the  dwindling of the individual\u2019s sanskaras  or impressions. In such cases,  the halo is like a growing bright circle of the mental atmosphere of  illumination: colorless throughout and yet, in every phase of its  manifestation, far, far richer in spiritual splendor than any  combination of colors can ever be.\n\nIf, due to love for his  Master, a man happens to see what appears to him as the halo of the  Master, it is not actually the halo but a part of his own aura as is  temporarily reflected by the effulgence of the halo of an illumined one  or of a Perfect Master.\n\nWithout necessarily being consciously  advanced on the path, and merely as a result of deep and sublime  emotions, the aspirant may from time to time have glimpses of the  reflections of inner sights, reverberations of the echoes of inner  sounds, redolences of the inner fragrance and distant shades of the  inner ecstasies. All of these are but trivialities connected with the  higher illusions of the path \\[planes\\]. There are also many techniques  and natural causes for the manifestations of such phenomena, which are  beyond the faculties of an ordinary man\u2019s mind. A book could be written,  especially regarding their potentialities and repercussions, both high  and low.\n\nAll illusory phenomena \u2013 gross, subtle and mental are  not only dream-stuff, but everything termed as \u201cfalse illusion\u201d is made  up of dream-into-dream stuff, which has no value at all unless it helps a  man to awaken to Reality.\n\nGod is the only Reality and all is  illusion. The whole of the gross universe is but a part of the huge  cosmic illusion containing higher illusions of the spiritual planes of  man\u2019s consciousness.\n\nLord Meher, American ed., Bhau Kalchuri, Vol. 15, pp. 5202 \u2013 5204.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 47037, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "MEHER BABA EXPLAINS AURA AND HALO", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564207833, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/chz5ta/meher_baba_explains_aura_and_halo/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DadaBhagwan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_qpfwq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564116248, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/chyenc/quote_of_the_day/", "gildings": {}, "id": "chyenc", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/chyenc/quote_of_the_day/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564116250, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 47018, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Quote of the Day!", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564202627, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/chyenc/quote_of_the_day/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "PegasusInFlightt", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_q5xk1gj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564105853, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/chwpee/seth_books_anyone_read_these/", "gildings": {}, "id": "chwpee", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/chwpee/seth_books_anyone_read_these/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564105854, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello.\n\nAnyone read the Seth books?

I'm still young, but about a year ago I got out of a relationship that left me with some emotional trauma. Soon after came the worst spiral of my life. I basically launched a war on everything I believed in or stood for. I was lucky and was able to go to a nice university, and worked hard to get good grades. But I threw all that aside. I began to hate myself to such an intense degree. I blamed everyone around me. I alienated myself, barely hung on (didn't drop out of school--though I know life would have found its way somehow, that would have made things so much harder). There came a point where I barely recognized myself in the mirror. Anything spiritual had completely vanished. There are still memories that are hard for me to access, and I'm in therapy still trying to figure everything out.\n\nAnyways, today I was at my summer internship, and as long as I'm getting my work done, I don't have to work the full 40 hour week. But I've been really struggling with waves of depression/apathy at work. One hit me really hard today and I couldn't take it any more. My boss wasn't in so I left to go home. Suddenly something came over me. I felt a karmic debt to the world, or something like that? I immediately made a volunteer profile to sign up for local volunteering opportunities in my hometown. I felt a sense of wonder. Like WOW why would I just sit here suffering through boring days, trying to find joy in playing video games or barely hanging in at work only due to some vague sense that I have to do it (I code and design, and I used to like it, but haven't in a while), when I could actually help people and give myself up to a cause where my performance isn't tied to my actual material worth? I felt some wonder for the first time in a while. This is all just sentimental feelings right now, but there is something spiritual feeling about this desire to give myself up, and it took me here. I can't exactly pinpoint what's spiritual about it, other than a momentary belief in karma, which is such a welcome change from daily feelings of meaninglessness, hopelessness, and nihilism.

By the end of the day you should be able to tell which NT/E/As you have most often by totaling the tally marks.\nThe NT/E/As with the highest scores are the ones you need to manage and work on the most.\nExample:\n_Severity_      _Arrogance_      _Vulgarity_\n\n\n_Deceit_       _Imprudence_       _Apathy_\n\n\n_Depression_      _Envy_           _Avarice_\n\n\n_Prejudice_    _Etc._\n\n\nAnd vice versa you should also keep a scoreboard of Positive Thoughts/Emotions/Actions to see what areas you excel at and which areas might need work.\nExample:\n_Mercy_         _Humility_         _Decency_\n\n\n_Honesty_       _Patience_       _Sympathy_\n\n\n_Joyful_      _Contentment_      _Generous_\n\n\n_Etc._\n\nIN THEORY this should help you improve your ability to be more aware of your own state of mind; and in turn help you become more, thoughtfully and emotionally, resolute and steadfast. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY keep in mind that NO ONE IS PERFECT! This is only a tool to help improve our daily lives not just inwardly, but outward as well. We will always have good days and bad days. We may even experience periods of good days (Serenity, Prosperity, Spiritual Afterglow), followed by periods of bad days (The Storm, Transformation, Dark Night of the Soul, etc.). Especially in cycles.\nThere will always be Darkness in the midst of the Light; but don't forget that there will always be Light to guide us out of the Darkness. And Hopefully this exercise will strengthen our Mind, Spirit, and Soul to be more prepared for, and help us persist through, the Dark times of our lives. Auspiciously enough, though take it as you will, as I was typing this out I noticed a painting on the wall that deeply connects with this:\nWeeping may endure for the Night (Darkness), but Joy will come in the Morning (Light)! -Psalm 30:5\n\n    -if you have any suggestions for the examples given (to make it more coherent); let me know and I'll make amendments to it. I'm not sure if any of this will resonate with anyone; as I didn't even intend to type the part after the example of Positive Thoughts/Emotions/Actions. I didn't even get half way through making it before I felt compelled to write out that the model is just a theory. Then everything beyond that just kind of flowed through my mind. I honestly didn't even intend to share this because I was just making this for myself; and when I share stuff like this with others I usually get treated like I'm crazy.

It was episode 868: \"Soul-Share with biologist turned 'NLP intuitive' Art Giser\", and he was telling me about how interesting NLP is but that the guy totally lost him when he started talking about healing people on the other side of the world with positive energy. \n\nI told him I didn't think that was so farfetched.

Reaching my spiritual awakening was crucial for me to start eliminating the mud, and being the young undisciplined chimp I am the mud occasionally comes back. The speculation I am somewhat frustrated about is the magnified polarity in me between these states of 'not concious' and 'concious with the drive to grow'. When I am in a state of 'not concious' which is when I sort of relapse into old habits (the relapses become less intense over time) I enter the self that stutters when anxious, that lets emotions get the control, that can be overly awkward. When I am in the state of being 'conscious' these symptoms go away, and overall feel like im where I'm supposed to be. Balanced. The issue in the speculation is that I've noticed that other people are much more functional in their 'unconscious' state. Like they clearly have their issues but can still be successful in the world. Can anyone relate? Any spirit brother/sister here with some insight?

The Lord states here that they are less intelligent. The materialists, who have no concept of God, think that they are advancing. But, according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, they are unintelligent and devoid of all sense. They try to enjoy this material world to the utmost limit and therefore always engage in inventing something for sense gratification. Such materialistic inventions are considered to be advancement of human civilization, but the result is that people grow more and more violent and more and more cruel, cruel to animals and cruel to other human beings. They have no idea how to behave toward one another. Animal killing is very prominent amongst demoniac people. Such people are considered the enemies of the world because ultimately they will invent or create something which will bring destruction to all. Indirectly, this verse anticipates the invention of nuclear weapons, of which the whole world is today very proud. At any moment war may take place, and these atomic weapons may create havoc. Such things are created solely for the destruction of the world, and this is indicated here. Due to godlessness, such weapons are invented in human society; they are not meant for the peace and prosperity of the world.\n\n**Question 1 : Why the materialists bereft of God consciousness are considered unintelligent ?**\n\n**Question 2 : What is the meaning of the word : alpa-buddhaya\u1e25 ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/9](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/9)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46909, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 16.9", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564128998, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/chkvz6/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_169/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "GiftsDiviniti", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_176g33", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564042597, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/chkvwc/give_goodluck_to_anyone_buy_gifting_them_with/", "gildings": {}, "id": "chkvwc", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/chkvwc/give_goodluck_to_anyone_buy_gifting_them_with/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "SgzPoU1rvGdH36FK8Hd1Y1nsZCVqghOo8uQrWpBx3kY", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-PDO5CK0i1rmyQJcsKwg4NIDzeYzOcRZViiGzl7EUVg.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f596be9df4236b2b1a8b16b0e9d0ffbac5dfc67e", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-PDO5CK0i1rmyQJcsKwg4NIDzeYzOcRZViiGzl7EUVg.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68d5e634b80fa718caf2d00391b5bbff15fe4bdf", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-PDO5CK0i1rmyQJcsKwg4NIDzeYzOcRZViiGzl7EUVg.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f2fe8f84698f8573fadd0023a5977dc9d314b0f", "width": 320}, {"height": 480, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-PDO5CK0i1rmyQJcsKwg4NIDzeYzOcRZViiGzl7EUVg.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbe28ce71592f124f8b19926a9d14383f79ec3d9", "width": 640}], "source": {"height": 600, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/-PDO5CK0i1rmyQJcsKwg4NIDzeYzOcRZViiGzl7EUVg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=177a51af72e2455487240508abd272998760bd2b", "width": 800}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1564042600, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46909, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Give Good-Luck to Anyone Buy Gifting them with Divine Gifts", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564128982, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/chkvwc/give_goodluck_to_anyone_buy_gifting_them_with/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DriftingSolipsism", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3vlnjgde", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564037530, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/chk78o/why_does_life_seem_to_stand_still_at_the_supposed/", "gildings": {}, "id": "chk78o", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/chk78o/why_does_life_seem_to_stand_still_at_the_supposed/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564037531, "score": 2, "selftext": "I am 21.

Mostly the musicians and obsessed is an understatement. I'm just in love with the history of everything. My favorite musician was Roger Bricoux, the 20yr old cellist and I was intrigued by him.\n\nLonger story cut shorter though, I had a dream a few weeks ago..but it felt real. It wasn't like a normal dream...if that makes any sense?\n\nIn the dream, I was on board the Titanic (cheesy, I know) and I could honestly feel the wind on my face. It was almost as if I had been transported back in time. I look around and I see one of the musicians who was on board of the Titanic who I hadn't really thought much about, George. \n\nWhen I saw him, he smiled and greeted me saying \"It's a pleasure to finally meet you, I've been waiting for this moment for a while now.\" And he kissed my hand and then took me on a brief tour of the ship.\n\nHe showed me around and our final destination was at an indoor swimming pool. Not going into detail, but things got steamy. Everything felt real. Every kiss, every touch. I can still remember every detail about it and how it felt. Afterwards, he looked at me and said \"I suppose it's time for you to go now. Until we meet again.\" And he gave me a gentle smile and kissed my hand one last time and then suddenly I woke up, with the feeling of my hand just being kissed.\n\nI was confused and a little embarrassed. I mean, this wasn't the man who was my favorite musician who was aboard the Titanic (though he is now for obvious reasons). I was a also confused because of the pool..I googled it because I didn't know if there was even a pool on the Titanic - well lo and behold,  there was. And the pictures looked terrifyingly identical to my dream. \n\nEver since then, I've felt this connection to him. And I just can shake it off. I've been depressed because I miss him terribly.  Its stupid because how can I even miss someone I've never even met? How can I miss someone who died 85 years before I was even born?

Fearing that his friend\u2019s belongings would be confiscated by the police, Xie, his son-in-law, Mr. Gao, and Mr. Gao\u2019s father, rushed to their friend\u2019s home. The three men worked until 2:00am, moving their friend\u2019s personal belongings to a safe place.\n\nThe three men rode their bicycles home in the early morning hours of 30 April; but as they neared the [town](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/town/) of Wugou, they were stopped by local police officers. Xie Yongjiang, who had been arrested previously as a member of [The Church of Almighty God](https://censamm.org/resources/profiles/church-of-almighty-god), a Chinese Christian [new religious movement](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/new-religious-movement/), was recognized by the officers. All the trio was arrested and taken to the Wugou [Town](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/town/) Police Station.\n\nTwo male officers beat Mr. Gao with a belt and kicked him, threatening death if Mr. Gao did not falsely admit guilt of the preaching charges. The police officers whipped Mr. Gao with a belt, until it finally broke. The following day, the police officers switched their torture weapon to a metal rod.\n\nThe following day, Mr. Gao and his father were taken to the [Public Security Bureau](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/public-security-bureau/) for further questioning and paper work formalities. It was then that Mr. Gao\u2019s father hinted to his son that something terrible had happened to Xie.\n\nThat evening, on their ride back to the police station, Mr. Gao asked their escort about Xie. The driver threatened to kill him if he inquired about Xie again. Mr. Gao and his father were sent to the Suixi [County](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/county/) [Detention Center](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/detention-center/).\n\nOn 1 May, a friend went looking for Xie at the Wugou Town Police Station. Miraculously, he was able to confirm that Xie was locked in a dark room with one small opening. Through this opening, Xie told his friend that he was not in good physical condition \u2013 the police had been ruthlessly torturing him.\n\nHearing of this news, Xie\u2019s wife immediately went to the police station to bring her husband a blanket. Upon arrival, she saw her husband in the station courtyard washing a police car. The officers however, refused her request to speak with Xie. She watched as he walked with a severe limp around the car \u2013 and this is the last time that she would see her husband.\n\nXie\u2019s wife visited him again the next day to bring him food. When she arrived, the police informed her that he had been transferred to Suixi County. On the afternoon of 2 May, Xie\u2019s family was notified that he had committed suicide in the police station. The police informed them that his body had already been sent to the crematorium. His family begged to see his body \u2013 a request which the authorities denied. However, through personal connections, they were able to see his body as it laid in the Suixi County Baishan Crematorium and to take some pictures.\n\nXie\u2019s son recounts that his father\u2019s body was covered in bruises, welts, and dried blood. His face and body were covered with lacerations. It was clear to him that his father had died after incredible suffering. The family concluded that Xie did not die from suicide and they sought justice. Xie\u2019s family set out to sue the Wugou Town Police Station.\n\nLocal authorities warned the family to settle the matter privately, but they refused. Once the news of Xie\u2019s torture and death spread around the community, there was local uproar. As a result, the Suixi County Procuratorate approved the arrest of police officer Wang Min. However, nearing the end of the court case, Wang Min retracted his testimony, stating that he was simply covering for the police station and was not really the one responsible for Xie\u2019s torture and death. Wang Min was then released on bail pending trial.\n\nThe case was brought to a civil mediation case in the Suixi People\u2019s Court. In the Conciliation Agreement, it was stated that during the interrogation Wang Min had hit Xie with a belt four times and had kicked him twice; after that, Xie hung himself. The court ruled that Wang Min owed the family 41,000 RMB in compensation. The family was not appeased as they did not seek money, but justice for Xie. They affirm to this day that Xie did not commit suicide. The pictures they were able to take just before his body was cremated speak for themselves.\n\nThis is one of twenty cases collected by the well-known Belgian NGO [Human Rights Without Frontiers](http://hrwf.eu/) in their new book, *Tortured to Death: The Persecution of* [*The Church of Almighty God*](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/the-church-of-almighty-god/) *in China* (Brussels: [Human Rights Without Frontiers](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/human-rights-without-frontiers/), 2018), published with the cooperation of *Bitter Winter*.\n\nThe 20 well-documented cases collected in the book are just the tip of the iceberg. In all likelihood, the number of cases of extra-judicial killings of members of The Church of Almighty God and devotees of other banned groups [classified as *xie jiao* (\u201cheterodox teachings\u201d)](https://bitterwinter.org/what-is-a-xie-jiao/) in China is much higher. But the cases included in the book offer enough food for thought, and they include top leaders of The Church of Almighty God such as Ma Suoping (female, 1969-2009), who was the national leader for the Church in Mainland China[. Cases of \u201corgan harvesting\u201d](https://bitterwinter.org/book-denounces-organ-harvesting/) from prisoners of The Church of Almighty God who were killed are also mentioned.\n\nTwo conclusions come from reading this valuable book. First, the torture and killing of member of The Church of Almighty God in China should be stopped immediately, with the cooperation of the international community and all free countries. Second, members of The Church of Almighty God who seek asylum abroad run a serious risk of being tortured and killed if they are sent back to China. They should be granted asylum, and repatriating them to China is a crime.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46870, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Tortured to Death: A New Book Documents Extra-Judicial Killings of Members of The Church of Almighty God in China", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564110168, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/chi3rk/tortured_to_death_a_new_book_documents/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Halfaxa666", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_11ug5s41", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564021223, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/chhnod/whats_up_with_dreams_lately/", "gildings": {}, "id": "chhnod", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/chhnod/whats_up_with_dreams_lately/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564021224, "score": 3, "selftext": "after years of barely remembering em I'm getting full movie shots,,intense stuff, different, harder hitting n easier codes to unravel, people I engage with or without interest in spiritual matters all seem 2 agree lately there's been somethin goin on 4 them just more vivid u could say, I wonder if it's a side effect or mass effect of the alleged intense happenings becoming or happening merging between realms, but I figured u guys would have some hot takes n experiences with this let me kno!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46868, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "what's up with dreams lately?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564107612, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/chhnod/whats_up_with_dreams_lately/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "dmoldlr", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3c714jw1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564018098, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/chh3hd/new_job_drains_my_energy/", "gildings": {}, "id": "chh3hd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/chh3hd/new_job_drains_my_energy/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564018100, "score": 2, "selftext": "I work in HR more specifically in Personnel selection, which means I interview a lot of people and lately, specially today I\u2019ve been feeling super drained, today I interviewed a guy and his energy was awful, and afterwards my energy levels declined and I got a headache and just felt all around awful.

He put my first bike together, that's the memory I have of him really. He was a tall, handsome dude with long hair. In hindsight I highly suspect he and my mum were romantically involved, while she and my dad were still married. I don't hold that against my mum, but I feel sorry for my dad.\n\nAnyway he was an amateur pilot. He went to Africa to participate in some sort of competition, flying a microlite. My mum had a dream, that he had an accident and died. She called him, told him not to do it, not to participate.. not sure how much she told him, whether she told him about the dream.. or if it was just that she had a bad feeling. He laughed it off, it'll be fine. Well her dream came true. He died flying the microlite. I wonder what his thoughts were when he realised he was going down.. because imagine being warned by a friend, and then in your last moments realising your friend was right; it's actually happening.\n\n\n\nThe second one is one I think about fairly often, and this is very strange. There was a high profile missing person case in my country. The body was found several months after the disappearance. A teen girl, believed to have been murdered by a certain serial killer. That's all I'll say as to which girl this was.\n\nWell anyway, the bizarre thing, this is a girl at the other end of the country by the way.. with no discernible connection to my mum. My mum had a dream; I don't remember the details too well but I remember there was one person in the dream aside from my mum. It was this this teen girl with quite a distinctive looking face, tall, slender, brown haired. Either my mum or the girl was ironing, forget which was ironing. And there was something to do with a mirror, like maybe my mum saw this girl behind her while looking in the mirror. I think there was some dialogue which could be linked in some way to what happened, it's very hazy as it was not my dream and it was all spoken about when I was a kid, not been mentioned for years now. But I dunno' I think the girl said something to my mum, and my mum found the whole thing odd and.. there was like a sad, morbid feeling apparently.\n\nWhen my mum woke up she told my brother about the dream, she did not tell me about the dream until later. She did tell my brother shortly after waking up though.\n\nSo then that very day this national news story breaks about this teen girl who has disappeared, and my mum recognises the girl from her dream. It's the girl from her dream. Then months later this girl was found to have been murdered. It's crazy.. I've never been able to make sense of it or even been able to work out how that happened.\n\nThe first one I can understand as it was a person close to my mum.. it doesn't even have to have been a premonition. Looking at it from a purely logical perspective, y'know attempting to attribute a logical explanation to each of these events, well the first one it could basically be my mum was anxious about her friend's endeavours in his travels, so anxious that she dreamed something terrible would happen and by coincidence her fears did come true as unfortunately they do sometimes. The second is more difficult though.. my only thought with regards to trying to explain it logically is that it was perhaps a confirmation bias; my mum saw the news on television and it occurred to her that the unfortunate girl looked like the girl in her dream, so then she comes to believe that it IS the girl from her dream. However if the real girl just looked like the girl from her dream, that still does not explain who the girl in the dream was. The question of why my mum was dreaming about that girl remains regardless of who the girl is, because either way it is not someone she knew. Furthermore the fact that the news story broke the very day after she had the dream is very coincidental, unless it was indeed a case of confirmation bias.\n\nWhen I was younger I used to believe my mum had premonition dreams. However as I've grown up and become a very logical minded person, I've come to believe that the first incident was her anxieties manifesting in dreams and coming true, and the second was likely confirmation bias. Still mad coincidences though.. and I'm not closed minded to spiritualism. I just believe in what is known to be true, what is evidenced. I am open to the idea that some things without evidence could be real, such as a spirit world, extra-terrestrial lifeforms. I don't think it would be crazy that those things exist.

What is a moment? When does it begin, and when does it end?\n\nThe word \u201cmoment\u201d is etymologically linked to the word \u201cmomentum\u201d, which comes from the Latin, *movere*, which means \u2018to move\u2019. All life is moving;\u00a0 a perpetual state of unfolding flow. As the Greek Philosopher Heraclitus put it:\n\n*\u201cNo man ever steps in the same river twice, for it*  \n*is not the same river, and he is not the same man.\u201d*\n\nThis *moment* is this *momentum* \u2013 this *movement*. A moment isn\u2019t a clearly defined length of time; on the contrary, all ideas of time happen *inside* this moment \u2013 this constant *movement*we always seem to find ourselves in.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard someone say \u201cit\u2019s now or never\u201d, well, it really is, because if you don\u2019t do it now, when else? We tell ourselves we\u2019ll do it tomorrow, but \u201ctomorrow\u201d and \u201cyesterday\u201d are words, sounds, symbols, concepts, and ideas which find their origin in *this* moment. From a subjective standpoint, we never \u201cget\u201d to any other moment. When I get to tomorrow I discover that it is indistinguishable from today.\n\nHave you noticed this?\n\nHas it ever\u2026 snuck up on you? That Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday are different words which allow humanity to segment, compartmentalize, and pigeonhole the day we are all living right now? Nature has no concept of yesterday, of tomorrow, of future, or past. We tie ourselves to concepts, unaware that *we* bought the linguistic rope.\n\nHow many times has someone told you that Monday is the worst day of the week? They grow anxious and frustrated at the thought of a concept. On what grounds is it the worst day? Yes, Monday often means work, but the \u201cday\u201d itself isn\u2019t *intrinsically* different to any other day you\u2019ve lived. Every day is exactly the same, but symbols and words are plastered over our direct experience, utterly convincing us that Monday and Tuesday are somehow *different.*\n\nThis brings us to eternity. To paraphrase Joseph Campbell, eternity doesn\u2019t mean a *long* time; eternity is beyond time, transcending all our ideas and notions of what time is and what *we think* it should be.\n\nIs it possible for you to see this eternity right now?\n\nThis might just be one of the deepest thoughts a person can contemplate, because the answer cannot be spoken, but must instead be felt and experienced by you, yourself \u2013 and no one can do it for you.\n\nCan you look at what\u2019s happening in front of you right now without clustering *this* moment into seconds, minutes, hours, and so on? Can you see *the movement*\u00a0as it unfolds before your eyes?\n\nIt\u2019s now or never.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46805, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Every Day is Exactly the Same -- some thoughts", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564074062, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/chau4e/every_day_is_exactly_the_same_some_thoughts/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "motherfunkk", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7gmo13f", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563986952, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/chaona/what_is_this_glowfog_that_i_see_around_people/", "gildings": {}, "id": "chaona", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/chaona/what_is_this_glowfog_that_i_see_around_people/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563986954, "score": 3, "selftext": "It\u2019s come to my attention since my freshman year of Highschool (I\u2019m now in college).

there is no God in control. It is produced of sex desire, and has no cause other than lust.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe demoniac conclude that the world is phantasmagoria. There is no cause, no effect, no controller, no purpose: everything is unreal. They say that this cosmic manifestation arises due to chance material actions and reactions. They do not think that the world was created by God for a certain purpose. They have their own theory: that the world has come about in its own way and that there is no reason to believe that there is a God behind it. For them there is no difference between spirit and matter, and they do not accept the Supreme Spirit. Everything is matter only, and the whole cosmos is supposed to be a mass of ignorance. According to them, everything is void, and whatever manifestation exists is due to our ignorance in perception. They take it for granted that all manifestation of diversity is a display of ignorance. Just as in a dream we may create so many things, which actually have no existence, so when we are awake we shall see that everything is simply a dream. But factually, although the demons say that life is a dream, they are very expert in enjoying this dream. And so, instead of acquiring knowledge, they become more and more implicated in their dreamland. They conclude that as a child is simply the result of sexual intercourse between man and woman, this world is born without any soul. For them it is only a combination of matter that has produced the living entities, and there is no question of the existence of the soul. As many living creatures come out from perspiration and from a dead body without any cause, similarly, the whole living world has come out of the material combinations of the cosmic manifestation.

I know that it might sound ridiculous, but I don't really know how to explain it correctly.\n\nEvery-time when I focus on a person, a little tinted glow appears around them. I don't know if it is their aura or something of that sort. To make this easier to understand I will write a short back story that will be written below.\n\nLast year I was an average 17 year's old girl. I didn't know nothing about spirituality and higher self conscious. After finding out about it. I started to meditate, read spiritual books by Osho, Wayne Dyer and so on. This is when the tinted glow started to appear. What I have also noticed is that whenever I distance myself away from spirtuality such as: stopping to meditate and start to smoke pot, go to parties, my abilities of seeing the tinted glow around people disappears. After quitting pot and alcohol, it has come back again. That doesn't matter, but I thought it might contribute to this mystery.\n\nI am uncertain that the tinted glow might be aura, as it changes consistently. I have observed it with some family members, when they are calm the tinted glow tends to be green, but when they are annoyed it tends to be red or even orange. The tinted glow tends to vary based on their mood.\n\nDoes anyone have an idea what this is? If so then, how can I wok on improving it and possibly turning into something that may contribute to future events? Sorry to bother you with my weird paragraphs, but nearly no one in my family is spiritual, so I can't really turn to anyone for this.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46711, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What is the weird glow that I see when I focus on people?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564017101, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ch1de6/what_is_the_weird_glow_that_i_see_when_i_focus_on/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "noideawhattocallme", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3imc4yco", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563925373, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ch0e0w/can_upcoming_thunderstorms_affect_our_energy/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ch0e0w", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ch0e0w/can_upcoming_thunderstorms_affect_our_energy/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563925374, "score": 1, "selftext": "For the last 2/3 days, I\u2019ve been feeling really displaced and uncomfortable.

We need two main ingredients:\n\n1: A panpsychist cultural operative system. This view would hold that everything is consciousness. There is a plane, a morphogenetic field, a cloud of information, that ends up creating the material world in the frontier between order and chaos. Any human, with a certain know how, can enter spiritual communication with this totality through mind, intuition, and channeling information.\n\n2: Pendulums. One of such channels is the act of interacting with a pendulum to ask it questions and then [watch how it moves] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfQo6C1rPwY). Normally through the use of yes or no answers.\n\nThere is are a bunch of traditions and different corpuses of knowledge on the interaction of different metals, rocks and crystals in this kind of communication. Different materials have different 'personalities'.\n\nThere should be constructed a pyramid, elongated, a couple meters tall. From this pyramid, made mostly of materials with resonance, should hang a multitude of pendulums. Each pendulum would have a different size, nature and position. There should be big, dry and dark pendulum on the center and at the top, whilst on the sides and on the lower levels, the pendulums should be more crystalline, scintillating and small.\n\nBelow this pyramid, a hole in the same shape of this pyramid, though inverted should be constructed. At the bottom of the hole there should be a space for a head looking from down below to the spectacle of pendulums. The body of the person should be inside a flotation tank/cocoon, from which only the head protrudes out into the pyramid.\n\nThe pyramid should be enveloped by water, as water creates also deep resonances. These resonances that permit the link between mind and reality must be waves of information stemming from the quantum fields that form the material canvas of reality.\n\nA well trained shamanic mind would stare into the constellation of pendulums hanging above him or her. He or she would begin to ask individual questions to individual pendulums, to which the answer lies in either order and chaos, and so movement would be vertical or horizontal.\n\nThe practitioner would take high quantities of psychedelics. The pendulums would begin to swing in accordance to the responses. The hole would have extensive sets of lights of different colours and intensities. Those lights would shine on all these pendulums. The swings of the illuminated constellation of pendulums would create tracers on the psychedelic eye of the beholder.\n\nThe trick would be to begin to create harmonies of swings, of ebbs and flows, corresponding to plethoras of interrelated philosophical, scientific or historical questions related to each other. The constellation could act as a proof holder of certain theories based on if the answers to the particular questions create harmonic movements of all those pendulums, kind of like when schools of fish swim as one in the sea, or alternatively, pendulums would begin to crash and hit one another chaotically, which would be no good.\n\nThe more deep a theory is, the higher and bigger pendulums could begin to be used. If done so correctly, and provided that are no negative spirits and forces around this area, this method of divination would be the equivalent of an industrial metallurgic industry to a blacksmith workshop.

From my understanding we shouldnt not chase anything from meditation because of attachment. We should do zazen just because that is our true nature and think nothing of it. \n\nI can kind of see what he means by this I think, but it seems like I would not become happier from it per se.

Hell, I'm not even sure if this is the place for a post like this, I just remember seeing a similar post here (regarding numbers you keep seeing like 11:11). Also English isn't my primary language, so apologies if there are times where I couldn't make myself clear enough.\n\nFor the past 6 months or so, there is a number that I keep seeing everywhere- 479. It's also my school number from primary school. Seeing it can be really freaky at times :D\n\n* Whenever I play sudoku, there is ALWAYS a 479; if there isn't, for example if there is only 7, I can place 4 and 9 next to it to make 479, which works all the time (I can confirm it works because I play on mobile). There are also instances where 4, 7 and 9 are the only numbers that I haven't entirely used on the sudoku board. Same thing happens in this tile-based game called \"okey\".\n* Whenever I'm having a bad time in an online competitive game, my score is 4/7/9 at some point. My in-game currency also hits 479 very frequently. Whenever I get out of a tough fight alive and check my remaining HP, it is 479. If I die, some guy dealt me 479 damage in total. Not all the time, but very frequently.\n* I had this discussion with a taxi driver about my academic plans (HS student here). He said his son is an alumni and he scored something around 479- he could've said it was around 480, but why be very specific with 479?!\n* Yesterday I played UNO for the first time in years. First 3 cards I drew? 4-7-9. I got to use them in the same order too xD also won all the games if it matters\n* Went to the store, bought some cheap snacks. Check the receipt, 4.79 in total.\n* Reddit post has 478 upvotes, I make it a 479 unless it is already a 479. This happens plenty of times in a day.\n* Maths exam? Square root of 479 melons. Biology question with numeral statistics? 479. Reading research paper on chem? There is a 479 somewhere.\n\nThese are all the occasions I can think of, but 479 keeps appearing throughout my daily life, even outside the articles above. \n\nTwo more \"coincidental\" stuff that I want to mention:\n\n* I know this happens to every person, but recently mine has been \"stronger than ever\". Spotify, I'm gonna shuffle my playlist and you're gonna play X song! \\*plays X song\\* Now play Y song! \\*plays Y song\\* Okay, today has been rough so gimme something happy \\*gives happy and motivational song\\* Now play a song that will remind me that our days on this world are numbered and we're all gonna die someday! \\*plays something which does exactly that\\* I SAID YOUNG MAN! \\*plays YMCA\\* Not even kidding, it feels like I'm using Amazon Alexa and it doesn't ever play a wrong song. Best thing is, if I don't say anything, I get to predict the next song! \n* Soon enough I'm gonna become an international student. I have this unconditional offer from somewhere in the Netherlands, and one conditional from Canada. This Canadian university has really been taking its time though, which keeps me impatient. This morning I checked my Yahoo account to see if there was a response, and on top left, I see the words \"[Yahoo! Mail Canada](https://i.gyazo.com/34d762f02a4150440df78505122ab0b2.png)\", which wasn't there before. I don't use VPN, either. I always used the same link to get to Yahoo, but for the first time it said \"Canada\". It also isn't a Canadian company as far as I know.\n\nWhat do I make of these? Mom thinks it's messages from a \"superior being\" about my future academic life, which I don't believe much in. 479 was fun and games, but after the Canada thing I lost my shit a little. Is this something you interpret for a \"deeper meaning\", or something you dismiss? I'm really confused atm, so any and all comments would be appreciated!\n\nHave a great day everyone :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46648, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How do I interpret these \"coincidences\"?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563987592, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cgv96l/how_do_i_interpret_these_coincidences/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "JakeMullerRE", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_qz7wn", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563899778, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cguxqi/something_thats_on_my_mind/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cguxqi", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cguxqi/something_thats_on_my_mind/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563899791, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey guys\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntoday I am feeling disappointed in and sorry for myself.\n\nIt's not the counterproductive kind of self-pity where I go all 'woe is me' for no apparent reason and play the victim, it's more for legit reasons to feel sorry for myself and it shifts my focus to forgiveness and what I really deserve and want out of life.\n\nIn the past I haven't been treating myself so well. For most of my life, I put up with things that were way below what I am worthy of and what I deserve, mostly because as a kid I grew up in a really shitty environment I had zero control about and didn't escape from because I didn't know better back then. The feelings or simply unawareness of what I am worthy of was mostly a byproduct of being around the wrong kind of people, of not having healthy self-esteem and confidence and of not loving/accepting myself enough.\n\nI think about all the bad things I did to myself and the mistakes I did and it's just unfortunate that this happened.\n\nFortunately tho, I know I can't change it so I will just forgive myself and leave this behind me.\n\nOver the last 3 years I changed a lot due to what I call my spiritual awakening. I discovered a passion for spirituality and meditation and it turned my life around for the better. I am a much healthier individual and much more successful now. So far I reached most of the goals I set around 3 years ago and I am on the way to reach even more of them.\n\nI am also living in a way better environment now because I took things into my own hands rather than being a victim of circumstance and realized that I am the creator of my reality and my life.\n\nI also want to say that forgiveness is basically a universal remedy.

I chopped that one too.\n\nAnd immediately after that, I saw a HUGE snake, mythical in size. Must have been a 50 foot snake, big in diameter as well. The sword I had turned into a giant sword.

I'll be there. \n\nI got dressed and headed over to his house. He pointed to where the snake was hiding, behind some random garage items. It was a pretty small snake, but it looked fiesty and ready to attack. I told him to hold a trash bag open while I grab it. I had some thin gloves on. As I grabbed its tail, it bites my hand. It didn't pierce the gloves though. \n\nWe got the snake into the bag, and drove a few miles towards a swampy area of the neighborhood. I poked a hole in the bag for the snake to escape and he went on his way. \n\nI really wanna hear people's thoughts on this!! Am I magic?

She was hooking up with this guy for about a year and right before she met me they decided to make it exclusive. He's not too spiritual and according to her \"they just don't connect the same way we do\". Well fast forward to about two weeks ago and they went camping together. I didn't know and was texting her as normal and he apparently saw and got upset that she had another friend she was close with. He told her that she needed to cut me out of her life or they couldn't be together. While they were camping, she blocked my number but quickly went back to talking with me everyday when they returned. She said she would take some time and decide what she really wanted and then make a decision. \n\nWell last week we were texting as normal and I said something flirtatious (as usual) and she stopped me. She told me I shouldn't keep hyping her up while she's still with him. I couldn't take it anymore, so I told her that she clearly made her decision and she couldn't keep talking to me if her boyfriend said so. \n\nShe has since tried to reach out but I kept my word and she hasn't heard from me since. The only thing is that I feel terrible through all this and I just want to be with her. I figured I would reach out to this community cuz you'll probably know how to deal with this sinking heart feeling.

Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nIn every civilized human society there is some set of scriptural rules and regulations which are followed from the beginning, especially among the \u0100ryans, those who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as the most advanced civilized peoples. Those who do not follow the scriptural injunctions are supposed to be demons. Therefore it is stated here that the demons do not know the scriptural rules, nor do they have any inclination to follow them. Most of them do not know them, and even if some of them know, they have not the tendency to follow them. They have no faith, nor are they willing to act in terms of the Vedic injunctions. The demons are not clean, either externally or internally.\n\nOne should always be careful to keep his body clean by bathing, brushing teeth, changing clothes, etc. As far as internal cleanliness is concerned, one should always remember the holy names of God and chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. The demons neither like nor follow all these rules for external and internal cleanliness.\n\nAs for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior, such as the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, which is the law of the human race. Even up to today, those who are Hindu follow the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. Laws of inheritance and other legalities are derived from this book. Now, in the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, it is clearly stated that a woman should not be given freedom. That does not mean that women are to be kept as slaves, but they are like children. Children are not given freedom, but that does not mean that they are kept as slaves. The demons have now neglected such injunctions, and they think that women should be given as much freedom as men. However, this has not improved the social condition of the world. Actually, a woman should be given protection at every stage of life. She should be given protection by the father in her younger days, by the husband in her youth, and by the grownup sons in her old age. This is proper social behavior according to the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. But modern education has artificially devised a puffed up concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is practically now an imagination in human society. Nor is the moral condition of woman very good now. The demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which is good for society, and because they do not follow the experience of great sages and the rules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition of the demoniac people is very miserable.\n\n**Question 1 : Which book is known as the lawbook for human beings ? What are some of the rules and regulations mentioned from it in this verse ?**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/7](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/7)",

But the world is obsessed with it. The world loves nothing more than worshipping the self. \n\nIt\u2019s constantly hammered into us that we need to love *ourselves*. The importance of *self*-esteem is constantly stressed. *Self*-worth. Taking *selfies*. \n\nAll of these things have always been a huge mystery to me. And the biggest reason is because if I really stop and examine my mind, I don\u2019t think I have ever really felt like I have an identity. I\u2019m a guy but have never really felt like a male. But I also don\u2019t really feel like a female either. As a child, I was equally drawn to masculine as well as feminine things. \n\nI was a child who loved Batman and Ninja Turtles and superheroes and the masculine energy behind those things, but at the same time I also remember loving to pretend like I was Cher. Or Bette Midler. Or Madonna. I was fascinated by makeup and secretly wished I could wear it. And I\u2019ve always been softer and more nurturing, which are definitely more female traits, but yet I also have an aggressive, extroverted masculine side. \n\nHowever, I\u2019ve never wanted to be a woman physically. I\u2019ve always wanted to look like a man and have a nice male physique. So as you can see, classifying my \u201cself\u201d in terms of gender is out. I\u2019m genderless.\n\nBut....although there have been certain body types of desired to look like, I\u2019ve never really identified with my own body either. It feels quite foreign and weird to me. I look at myself in the mirror and have always felt like the person that\u2019s staring back at me is a stranger. \n\nAnd as I\u2019ve gotten older, beliefs about who I am have begun to crystallize more and more. \n\nFor most of my life, if someone were to ask me who I am, that would always be a really tough question. But a few years ago, I thought of the perfect answer\u2014who I am is my mind. That\u2019s what/who I indentify with the most. And my mind is formless. And it\u2019s sooooo many things. It\u2019s simultaneous everything and nothing all at the same time. \n\nSo I\u2019ve had this thought in my mind for a long time. But yet, in every day life, I\u2019m still forced to identify with *myself* in one way or another. And I\u2019ve still tried to force the concept of the self upon....myself. \n\nNow, I\u2019ve always been aware of the concept that many people believe in\u2014that the  \u201cself\u201d is a fallacy. God didn\u2019t create us, he (if you want to personify Source energy) *is* us. And we are God. The universe doesn\u2019t exist outside of us, we are the Universe. \n\nSo I\u2019ve always been aware of this concept, but until just the other day, this never really sank in. \n\nBut something I\u2019ve recently just decided to do has recently made this sink in for me:\n\nI\u2019m experimenting with some manifestation techniques, and have decided to put my thoughts in writing instead of saying them out loud. And this is for two reasons. One is because saying things out loud and hearing my own voice feels weird to me, but the second reason is because I also express myself better in writing than I do verbally. \n\nBut one thing I\u2019ve struggled with is writing my thoughts down in first person. Using the words \u201cI\u201d or \u201cme\u201d and talking that way just feels so.....weird to me. I don\u2019t know how else to explain it. \n\nSo then I thought, what if I write things in third person instead of first person? What if I refer to this person that is supposedly me as someone else. What if I write from the point of view *of* God?\n\nAnd this instantly felt SOOOOOOO much better. I immediately thought \u201cOkay, this is it! This is what\u2019s been missing!\u201d\n\nAnd then it dawned on me that *I don\u2019t have to have a self* if I don\u2019t want to. Because it doesn\u2019t matter. I am God. I am Source. And all this body is that I find myself in right now is merely an avatar of sorts. Sent down to earth for the purpose of expansion. \n\nAnd I feel like this is one of the most life-changing realizations I have had in a very long time.

One day I\u2019m not going to wake up. I thought the feeling I was getting from it was anxiety but now I\u2019m starting to see it more as it\u2019s me being humbled by this whole thing. Anyways, the past few nights I\u2019ve been nonstop thinking about life, what happens to us when I die, and so on. \n\nLast night I had a dream that I could remember clear as day, which for me is a rare occurrence. It was me, at someone\u2019s funeral (i think my own) and there were my deceased grandfather and aunt. My dreams are normally in color but they\u2019re vague and often turn to white and black in my memory. The same for this dream, except my grandfather was wearing his typical yellow button up and my aunt was wearing this vibrant purple shirt. This was also the first dream I can ever recall being able to smell. They smelled exactly how I remembered them. \n\nThe weirdest part of the whole thing to me was the conversation we had, it was us catching up like two people would if they haven\u2019t seen each other in many years. But at the end, without me even asking they both told me it\u2019s nothing to fear, look at us, we\u2019re both doing just fine. Live your life the way you want, and come back to us when it\u2019s all over and tell us all about it. \n \nImmediately woke up crying tears of sadness, because of how much I miss them and overwhelmed with joy because I got to see them again. \n\nAs I told my friend as work who\u2019s very into spirituality about this, she told me it wasn\u2019t a dream. They actually came over to talk to me. I still can\u2019t grasp my mind around this. She\u2019s opened up my eyes to the world of spirituality and she always talked to me about how gifted I am. But this is the first real encounter that actually \u201cfreaked\u201d me out. \n\nI guess I just need a place to share this, if you made it this far in post thank you.

Losing is a part of everyday life.  At times you can get beat and other times you will be recognized for doing your best; that is all part of life's true gifts when we take them as lessons and learn from them.  I honestly believe we can truly fail in life only when we quit.  If we never quit, then we never fail!  What a simple approach -- *think about it*.  You have the ability to [**empower yourself**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/empower-yourself/) each moment of each day and to improve in all aspects of your life.  I call that [**coaching yourself**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/coach-yourself/) towards your greatness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHalf the struggles in life are about learning how to choose your battles wisely and to remain vigilant and persistent in doing so. The winning strategy here is not to \u201cwin the proverbial war,\u201d but to win at what you do best and not give up in the act. Margaret Thatcher, a one-time Prime Minister of Great Britain once said that you may have to fight the battle more than once to win it, and that is not only a challenge to you but a fact in life. I cannot begin to imagine how many wonderful feats would not have been accomplished had it not been for the tenacity and determination of those talented individuals who created some of the lackluster tools that we now take for granted. Alexander Graham Bell could never have fathomed the routine use of his telephone, nor could he have ever foreseen the branches it would take in its expansion toward wireless communications.  But it was his many struggles to create something new and innovative that led to what we have today. He never failed to [**coach himself**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/coach-yourself/) because he believed in himself.  Do you believe in yourself?  It did not happen overnight, and it was not an easy feat \u2013 but his vigilance and persistence paid off in the end because he was continually working to [**empower himself**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/empower-yourself/) towards the vision he had.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother fine example of overcoming failures to live a purpose-filled life was a teacher by the name of Anne Sullivan. Had Sullivan ever conceded to her misgivings of trying to teach a deaf and blind girl, there never would have been such an inspirational story of going against all odds to do the seemingly impossible\u2026*but she did*. Sullivan was convinced to use persistence and willpower to help develop one of the fondest motivational and heart-touching stories of all time: Helen Keller; who subsequently went on to writing and publishing 12 books, among pursuing several other lifeworks. Anne Sullivan never stopped [**coaching**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/coach-yourself/) Helen because she believed in her abilities.  Her persistence and desire to [**empower**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/empower-yourself/) Helen Keller bore great fruits.  You too, can bear your greatest joys if and when you are willing to [**coach yourself**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/coach-yourself/) and discipline yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, there are many other success stories throughout the course of history. I would not have enough days in a lifetime to tell you about those who went on to overcome failures to succeed at what they did best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Do you believe in yourself enough to refuse* to fail in life? Have you given up on trying to succeed or have you become weak and decided you want to give up on yourself? I want you to [**empower yourself**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/empower-yourself/) and pray for courage and strength because you deserve to reap the benefits of your labor.  To survive means that we must live to fight another day. If we no longer have reason to rise above the human condition and circumstance, then we have not begun to live at all. My challenge to you is to look within yourself to discover your hidden talents so you too, can manifest prosperity, happiness and a purpose-filled life. Failure is not a curse word, but a blessing in disguise. It is through failure that we learn to humble ourselves. It is through failure that we learn what not to do and what precisely it is we need to do in order to succeed. Failure is in virtue, the defining thread of life that enables us to see our shortcomings and discover our potentiality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you believe you will fail, surely that will be the case. But the same holds true for those who believe they will succeed. When you plant the seed of fortune in your mind and spirit, you begin to manifest blessings that have long awaited you. As we grow, we learn from our mistakes. In Walt Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d Rafiki swats Simba on the head with a stick. He then says to the young lion cub that the past can hurt, but that he can either run from it or learn from it.  In order to conquer your future, you must first forgive yourself and release your past.  Learn from your failures and move forward with your head held high and with persistence and determination in your heart. You too, can manifest a prosperous and joy-filled life once you understand that past failures are not for you to carry, but from which to learn and to discover the true essence of you and who you intend to be. Tell yourself this often; [**coach yourself**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/coach-yourself/) towards your greatest joy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are no real \u201cfailures\u201d in life, after all \u2013 only valuable lessons to be learned. How we perceive our disappointments is half the work. How we react to them is the harder part of the lesson.*?* It is time for you to let go of those old wounds and hurts. It is time for you to re-evaluate the choices you have made so that you can make the right choices from this moment forward. You can no longer fail in life because as long as you never quit, you are destined for success\u2026*and that, my friends, you can take to the bank.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The links in the article are to my website posts on the topic.*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46474, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do you believe in yourself?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563903329, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cggadd/do_you_believe_in_yourself/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "JMWcontent", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_wp7wr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563816272, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cgg4wa/coach_yourself/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cgg4wa", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cgg4wa/coach_yourself/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563816275, "score": 0, "selftext": "Often, you hear Mom and I speak of the necessity of coaching yourself, and may wonder what it entails, or how to get there from where you currently are?

Now, I tried the buttercup experiment, and sure enough, my chin glowed yellow.  It was such a silly little amusement, but I remember smiling to myself knowing that a simple flower could say so much about me.  Of course, the buttercup glowed a faint yellow beneath my chin because I was out in the sunlight and the manifestation of the bright gold color was only evident due to the sun\u2019s light. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were a few lessons to be gained in the buttercup experiment: trust, was the first. I learned first that I had to trust that the buttercup would glow beneath my chin; and it did. The second lesson was that in nature, all things are possible. The third lesson was that the sun is a remarkable thing that not only brings us the warmth and light to give life to all the earth, but that it has the power to do miraculous things. I smile when I think about this because in my mind\u2019s eye, I can recreate the time and feeling of how a lowly buttercup was able to make me giggle\u2026and believe in something that I may not have before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can learn a lot from nature.

But it doesn\u2019t just surround us; it\u2019s a part *of us*. That\u2019s the beauty of it. We are all interconnected to the glorious creation and wonder that we call the Universe.

Everything in life is about relationships, that is [**Relationship**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/relationship-expert/) with self, your job, your boss or teammates, your partner, children etc.  If you are unable to feel good about yourself, you will not be able to feel healthy or whole in other aspects of your life.  An improved and positive attitude will lead you to a successful life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember that little boy or girl who tried so hard to love and to be loved; and no matter what the child tried to do, it seemed to not be good enough for others? Some of you still battle with that child within. You may appear to have balanced lives, comfortable houses, good careers and nice cars\u2026 but your relationships are not whole or in harmony \u2014 primarily because within your inner being is that little boy or girl, who is still consciously or unconsciously clinging to past experiences. You put up a barricade so that others can never truly enter into your lives because you are fearful that you may be rejected, deprived, neglected or abused.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do I overcome my anxieties; you ask? You begin by accepting the past hurts of your life and forgiving yourself and those around you who may have contributed to the feelings and/or the emotional wall that you have built around yourself. Even if you do not reconcile these issues in person, you only need to say aloud, \u201cI accept who I am. I forgive those who have hurt\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe and I am more than enough.  I forgive myself for holding onto the feelings that I have created in my life. I am free.\u201d Each time any triggers or emotions start creeping up in your life, repeat the mantra above; in fact, repeat it often till you own it.  It will help you sort through your challenges and allow you to move forward guilt-free and uninhibited. Remember, only you have the power to overcome your emotional burdens.  If you continue to focus on what is no longer a part of your life, you will build your metaphorical wall higher and higher until you can no longer see over it.  Become your own [**relationship expert**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/relationship-expert/); Look in the mirror or sit quietly and meditate on who you are.  Do you believe you are more than enough; do you like yourself and all that you have become?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cWhen you change what you believe, you change what you do.\u201d  We all deal with setback at one time or another.  Those conditions do not have to control you or set you up to be in misery.  Quite the contrary!  Allow them to be a learning lesson and then use them as a stepping - stone to help you rise above as you cultivate a positive and transformational attitude.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou are good enough. In fact, you are better than just \u201cgood enough\u201d. You are unique in every way. When you begin to see beyond your emotional wall and your poor attitude, you will finally be free from what has chained you for far too long.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have the power within to improve all relationships in your life but first you need to come to terms with your first and most important r elations and this with self.    Be conscious as to where you are placing your attention, become a strong [**relationship expert**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/relationship-expert/) for yourself.

As a [**relationship expert and consultant**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/joan-marie-whelan-relationship-consultant/), I have guided, empowered and encouraged others to find their truth about themselves.

Yet many people haven\u2019t tried to find their own personal source of love.  It takes effort and work on your part to come to terms with yourself.  It is my personal belief that when people willingly build a sound foundation for their personal life, they are in a better position to design, plan and strategize how they want their life to play out and who they want to attract to become a part of that picture.  Life is better when it has been planned out, nurtured and developed.

You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection.\u201d \u2013 Buddha*\n\nLove is indeed a splendorous thing \u2014 but what it boils down to is being able to find the love within yourself to restore the harmony and balance to your authentic self.\n\nDeep within the core of your very existence is the special coding of whom you are \u2014 *this is your authentic self*. It\u2019s that part of your being, which is free from all external influences and inhibitions. When you learn how to love yourself unconditionally, you are able to reconnect with your intuitive soul power; which is in essence, your authentic self. Why reconnect with your intuitive soul power, because it is the direct link to the Universal flow of energy that guides all things living. We are all a part of this beautiful Energy Source; and when we realize the value and nature of its worth, the more compelled we are to achieve greatness in life.\n\nIf you truly want to [**empower yourself**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/empower-yourself/) to [**heal your life**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/heal-your-life/) on various levels, you first must learn to love yourself! I am going to discuss a few ways that you can empower your authentic self so you can begin to trust your gut feeling, your intuition and begin making the best choices for your life. As an **Intuitive expert**, I know what I am about to suggest will be most helpful to you in [**transforming your life**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/transform-your-life/) for the better. \n\n*Feed your mind* *with empowering thoughts, ideas and visions.* Life is energy and so is love; and the more love you feed yourself, the happier you will be. Instead of focusing on negative energy in your life, think about the many blessings that exist around you. \n\nSurely where you are, there must be nature. And even if all else has gone awry, there is positive energy that can be found in nature. Find a quiet park, stream, or fishing hole. Look around yourself. Nature will provide you with the inspiration you need to move beyond the negativity. Whether it\u2019s an image in your mind or a real-time view of an aging oak tree or a passing flock of seagulls, observe the wonder and beauty of every aspect in these living things.\n\n*Focus* on the outline of your eye\u2019s object. Notice the color, the shape, the size, the feel, the scent. What do you see, what do you smell, how does it feel to the touch? In these last few seconds, I am certain that all negative thoughts were pushed to the wayside. You have fed your mind with empowering thoughts \u2013 positive thoughts that transcend negativity. Nature = love. Personal and emotional empowerment is love. When you [**empower**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/empower-yourself/) your mind with positive energy, it will send a vibrational signal to every cell in your body and to every living thing in your energy field.   This is [**transformational**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/transform-your-life/)! This is [**healing your life**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/heal-your-life/) at the most basic root.  That is absolute power at work! It\u2019s phenomenal.\n\n*What is absolute power**?* Have you hugged your dog, your child, or close friend? When you embrace, there is a great force of energy that is exchanged. This mutual energy is healthy and allows your body to arrive at a natural state of total relaxation. That\u2019s a wonderful feeling \u2014 not having to worry about why, who, what, where, when\u2026simply being in the present moment of love. That same feeling is what your authentic self provides you. This is your uninhibited, natural source of love. Hug more, touch more, and *be in touch* with the abundance of love.\n\n*Self-Forgiveness.* I know, it\u2019s hard to let go sometimes; but this is absolutely critical to rediscovering and empowering the love of your authentic self. A lot of times, we harbor resentment and anger from past emotions and encounters. Even when others may have caused distress, it is still by choice that we continue to preserve these negative feelings. We have to look beyond the anger, intolerance, and any other animosity to overcome hurdles in our lives. Breathe, slowly \u2013 inhale, exhale. Repeat this exercise a few times. Can you feel the negative air clearing your head? It is. *Don\u2019t hold onto it anymore.* *You don\u2019t need it*. In fact, you have now taken one of the essential steps to improving your vitality and getting reconnected to your authentic self. As a [**relationship expert**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/relationship-expert/), I can truly say that all healthy relationships start with self. With each breath you inhale, I want you to visualize the absolute power of love\u2019s energy flowing into you and circulating through every part of your physical body. Build a healthy [**relationship**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/relationship-expert/) with yourself and you will begin to draw to you, more healthy situations individuals and circumstances into your life. When you exhale, I want you to release all the negative, bent-up emotions. Got anger? Exhale it. Got regrets? Exhale it.  Got sadness?  Release it.\n\nDo you want to [**transform your life**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/transform-your-life/)? Want peace? Inhale it. Want love? Inhale it. Want freedom? Inhale it. Every time you breathe in, attach a positive word to it. When you breathe out, attach your negative baggage to it. *That\u2019s it. It is done*. You have forgiven yourself and you are now ready to embrace love to its fullest extent.\n\nAs an [**intuitive expert**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/intuition-expert/), I can tell you that if you practice all that I have just shared with you, your life will become more enriched and more content. You must always remember that you are in total control of what you feel and about what you think. Loving yourself is the most liberating, [**self-empowering**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/empower-yourself/) thing you can do for you. Start right now by letting go and letting love in\u2026and count every day as a blessing. Remember that the power is within you to [**heal your life**](http://joanmariewhelan.com/heal-your-life/) as you are transforming from the old paradigm into your new authentic self. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe links in the article are to my website posts on the topic.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46468, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Self-Empowerment: Learning how to Love You", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563900323, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cgfmg7/selfempowerment_learning_how_to_love_you/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "l3g10nw", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_h1r1b", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563812239, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cgf9g1/anyone_experiencing_this/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cgf9g1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cgf9g1/anyone_experiencing_this/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563812247, "score": 3, "selftext": " \n\nI've been going through many many \"out of this world\" experiences. It would be amazing if someone resonates with one of these things, so that we can talk about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1- A lot of synchronicities. almost every 2 minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt first I thought i was going nuts. It was odd to see how many things are connected to my feelings and my mind. Now, I've gotten so used to them. To the point where i can 'forsee' the short future based on what I am feeling/thinking. example: gets a feeling someone (knowing who exactly) is coming through that specific place and will say/do that specific thing. (it's chocking at first but getting this so often that i see it normal).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2- I feel like life is a sort of a rymthmic music.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis may sound odd too. and it's a bit difficult to express. For example, as i am writing this, i hear people, music and other external things matching what i am doing or the mood i am in. like if i get scared or angry, i will hear or see something that matches my emotions. like if the outside flows with whats inside of me. i guess the best way to explain this is to call it \"a music/water like experience\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3 - Manifestation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf i concentrate on something, wether by resistance or allowance, it manifest. this is the most odd i think. And it has a double edge. it's good because if i concentrate on water, for example, i will be getting water. but if i resist an unwanted experience, then i will be getting the unwanted experience... xD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4 - no name\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis one ill try to express it in words. but i guess youll have to be within me to know. lets try to explain it:\n\n\\\\i feel like everything from time to time. like if the keyboard and this screen is in essence me. i cant really put it into words D:\n\nlets try another way. imagine you are not the things you experience with your senses. but the actual ... hmm, awareness behind it? xD I hope someone can get it. it is a good feeling. very powerfull and profound too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5 - Memories\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI keep \"remembering\" being in different worlds and with very different type of people. have you heard about atlantis, lemuria and such? kind of like that but not how it is shown. more like some ET memories. But i am not an ET D:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6 - many more\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get to \"read minds/emotions\" of animals and people. This is great but also i have to step away from some people that has weird feelings and thoughts that dont taste good to me.\n\nTelepathy - This one feels normal, i think we as a whole are able to do it but just do not pay much attention to it. so when ever i get this one (and is quiet often) it feels natural. yet it's odd to many people haha\n\nEmpathy. If someone is into feeling anything, and i am paying attention to the person or animal, i feel it too. but it goes beyond what is normal empathy for people. It is so strong to the point i cant watch violent movies, shows, etc. nor hear music or talks where the attention is drawn to an unwanted events. i can only pay attention to joy, fun and high vibration emotions now xD\n\nThere are more but those are tooooooo odd to even start talking about then hahaha", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46466, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Anyone experiencing this?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563898623, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cgf9g1/anyone_experiencing_this/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Ccerberus667", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2mrkx2r6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563811161, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cgf14e/is_it_possible_to_be_spiritual_and_believe_in_god/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cgf14e", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 16, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cgf14e/is_it_possible_to_be_spiritual_and_believe_in_god/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563811162, "score": 8, "selftext": "I was raised in a Baptist family and my mom who is heavily Christian always tells me to be mindful of things so I wont get sent to hell.

"So to cut a long story short I\u2019ve had depression on and off my whole life and anxiety pretty much through all of it , my main issue with the anxiety is it causes me to blush a lot\n\nThe past couple of years I\u2019ve been reading Eckhart tolles work and it sits with me very very well , I\u2019ve been putting a lot of it into practice and I am becoming much more present and my whole perspective of life is changing \nalso done a lot of work on noticing when my egos trying to feed along with the pain body I\u2019m starting to notice them as soon as there line of thoughts come up and feel I\u2019m slowly detaching from my attachment with them \nI\u2019d been on an ssri the past 12 months which put a stop to the anxiety and blushing (which I knows triggered by thoughts) but also put a stop to feeling emotion \n\nSince coming off them the last few months the emotions are coming back and I\u2019ve been doing very well to let down try and focus purely on feeling them and accepting them which I\u2019m certain is helping me a lot!\n\nNow where I need guidance , I need to know what level to accept and and when to dive deeper\n\nAs an example , a teacher shouting at me in class would make my thoughts race , face turn red , emotion of embarrassment will arise then if feel strong anxiety/emotion in my stomach\n\nDo I leave it at that and work on accepting and feeling the feeling in my stomach and accepting that this happens in this situation \nOr do I dive deeper , I realise all that\u2019s going on so do I need to then go deeper and feel what\u2019s causing the anxiety/emotion to rise in this situation and trace it through as far as I can to what\u2019s lead to it then accept it at that point?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false,

So I smoothly pushed in the concept of inconsistency into our conversation. Like how people and things we hold on to so dearly aren't really ours etc. This person got pretty mad and said I've a very narrow  and judgmental mind. I really do not mind being insulted. I apologised for not being helpful and ended the conversation. I actually felt so bad for them. I wish I could have helped them with what I've learned in life but it seems they're just not interested to look into that. Do you guys face this kinda incidents?

Now hear from Me of the demoniac.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, having assured Arjuna that he was born with the divine qualities, is now describing the demoniac way. The conditioned living entities are divided into two classes in this world. Those who are born with divine qualities follow a regulated life; that is to say they abide by the injunctions in scriptures and by the authorities. One should perform duties in the light of authoritative scripture. This mentality is called divine. One who does not follow the regulative principles as they are laid down in the scriptures and who acts according to his whims is called demoniac or asuric. There is no other criterion but obedience to the regulative principles of scriptures. It is mentioned in Vedic literature that both the demigods and the demons are born of the Praj\u0101pati; the only difference is that one class obeys the Vedic injunctions and the other does not.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the two types of conditioned living entities ?

My life infused into this apocalyptic-like but ever transforming world of trickery and mind games. So I was definitely fighting some demons, my own or otherwise. Definitely uncovered some important fucking information that the dream or dare I say the dmt in my brain wouldn't let me bring back. It was like a fucking tim burton movie that I was consciously controlling but at the same time so much shit was out of my control. But some of the themes I was able to grasp onto was more than enough info for me especially because it correlated directly to me and/or every other person that's on this journey of self realization. One vision I'll never forget is a huge crowd of people at this construction site. Basically it was the same old story of humans being hard headed and getting punished for it. The construction men were telling everyone to get back and stuff (getting harder to remember as I think back on it) and I remember seeing kids and families just jumping into the pool of childlike curiosity. I cant remember what the exact outcome was of them jumping in like that but I know it cant be good. And it seemed like the dream was a message to not do dmt because I'll just fuck myself up but I know I have to now. A guy on YouTube explained dmt as basically quiting the game of forgetting everything and just full on remembering literally everything. You remember you are every living being on this planet, you are \"god\" and when you do dmt you are the snake biting its own tail realizing itself.  And that explanation is none other than fact for me at this point. All I need is for the dmt trip to validate it even though I know its true. After all that rambling I guess I want to know about some other experiences with spiritual warfare in dreams or just in waking life.

About 8 months ago i learned how to direct my energy to certain places in my body that felt discomfort and literally heal or release a block age. I could actually feel like a crackling or a pop and i would moved it through my body and breathe it out. This at times was very painful but i have moved around my whole body and from the base of my back upwards. Sometimes when i would do this physical healing i would have emotionnal memories come up that i would insight and some were emotionally painful. I would sometimes cry and release this pain. About 2 weeks ago i was working in my upper chest and shoulders and up my neck and throat. It was very uncomfortable and i had a rush of full energy move up into my ear, jaw, and cheek. It was so painful and for two weeks i had almost like a lock jaw where it hurt to eat and everything. I also had a fuller range of motion in my jaw. Throughtout the last two werks i finally worked thru the pain and blockages. There was so many and now i have almost no pain and my mouth feels more open like i can talk and eat easier than any time before. I used to have horrible posture and bowed in hips or basically crooked posture and now my body feels so much more alligned. After this release the closer i get im starting to hear vibration sound pretty loud. Inside and outside its sounds like long slow vroooooom vroooooooom vroooooom and i also am getting loud hi pitched ringing in my ears that slowly gets quieter and fades out. These are things i have never experienced before but i am having syncronicities like crazy in my life and i feel like half of myself is melting off and i want the rest of it off. I feel like im really close to something but i have no one to talk to and i feel like they will judge me or think ive snapped. Anyone out there that may have advice, input, maybe if someone can share there experience if they are drawn to, this is what im looking for.

What I've come to understand is that this is exactly what gods and deities are, but its not something to dismiss them for. \n\nOne thing to understand before continuing is that the collective human mind has evolved through stages. At one point voodoo and magic formed our conceptual understanding of the universe we were born into, and as new philosophers and societies came along they began to understand it through souls and deities. In the past century we have discovered the empiricist worldview, and it has been the largest leap in human consciousness evolution yet. However, we came to believe that this new view excluded and \"bettered\" past views, making them obsolete. That's where I personally stood just a while ago. \n\nThe thing is, empiricism has a blind spot: it can only help us understand the universe as *outside* of us. It has to separate parts into parts and examine each piece separately before putting it back together. Each tool we've designed can only pick up on a small window of reality, due to its limited design. The thing that makes consciousness so special is that it is able to reflect upon itself, turning the mirror inwards. This pursuit is called spirituality, and combining it with empiricism gives us the most complete view of the universe. Both the inside and outside views combined.\n\nSo, why did ancients describe the universe through deities? Well, the things they call deities can only be understood internally. They aren't available to us empirically because they exist through the world, not on the surface of it. For example, one of the major figures of Hinduism is Vishnu, the God of Destruction and Creation. This God is not something that can be understood through measurement, since it doesn't come in contact with anything. Rather, it is the nature that acts through *everything*. In order to come to understand Vishnu, you must experience her first hand - internally. She won't set off any of your fancy tools, but she will let you know she's there when she passes through you. However, this is personification. Just like we see how a loved one reacts to situations and call that their personality (their nature which guides their action), we understand the nature of these complex interactions as personas. In a very real way, you can locate the nature causing action through exploration, and then form your own relationships with them. \n\nEmpiricists have attempted to use the word Entropy to describe the Hindu's beloved Vishnu, but they are only attempting to categorize her from the outside in. Understanding her, or any other force behind the movements of the universe, through internal exploration is the only way that we can understand these things personally. They have substance, but it must be examined as though it were part of you, not something separate to be measured and rationalized.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46369, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The substance of gods and deities", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563850765, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cg7r9u/the_substance_of_gods_and_deities/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "jLionhart", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_n3whu", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563764327, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cg7qxd/the_enlightened_soul_is_one_who_performs_their/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cg7qxd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 38, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cg7qxd/the_enlightened_soul_is_one_who_performs_their/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563764328, "score": 5, "selftext": "To me, we are the awakened or the enlightened Soul when we simply perform our spiritual duties while alive in the physical body.

A succubus is a female dream invader. Incubi and succubi can be considered as spiritual vampires since they possess the same abilities which are: to charm, to seduce while draining their victims emotionally and spiritually. Based on Sumerian and Hebrew mythology, specifically from the Alphabet of Ben Sira, the first succubus known to the world was Lilith or Lilitu, the first wife of Adam. \n\nThe story states that God created a first mate for Adam before Eve, and that her name was Lilith, but that Lilith refused to submit sexually to Adam, claiming her right to be treated as equal to him. And that instead of mating with him, she fled the Garden of Eden, and went to lay with the archangel Samael. In her action, she angered God. And so, God punished Lilitu and made of her the first succubus who must prey on the newborns on their first week, and prey on men while they\u2019re asleep, to steal their sperm to populate the world with demons. Which is why Lilith is also called the wife of Satan. \n\nBased on Sumerian mythology, the fist incubus known to the world was Gilgamesh\u2019s father, Lilu. Lilu is a derivative from Lilitu. This demon, Lilu, was known to disturb women in their dreams by sleeping with them. From one of those encounters, the Babylonian hero, Gilgamesh was an offspring; which is why he was two-part God and one-part man. Hence, we can conclude that incubi and succubi are demons that are capable of taunting you sexually in your dreams. The legends also insist that Incubi are capable of impregnating women, and that they have been spawns. But King James came with the theory that in order to impregnate the women, the incubi had to steal the sperm from the dead body of a man. \n\nThere are many accounts of encounters with Succubi and Incubi, mostly in Jewish and Christian folklores but they all seem to me a bit fabulous and exaggerated. For starters, those stories were written in the era of Great Inquisition, and the era of the great Witch Hunt under King James reign. Eras where women had no say and were seen as commodities that you can marry off for position and were speaking of sex was considered heretic and taboo. \n\nSaint Augustine, in the 4th century, and Saint Thomas of Aquinas, in the 13th century, each in their own era reported accounts of nuns being attacked by incubi. But I am pretty sure, if we were capable of investigate those events at the time, that we would most likely find instead multiple cases of sexual abuses and assaults. I am not saying that the demon attacks didn\u2019t happen but that it looks very suspicious that all the nuns in the same abbey are being sexually assaulted in their dreams. Unless it is mass hysteria, something is off in this story. And you heard me saying this over and over again: stop being afraid because when you are, you cannot learn anything, you cannot see or comprehend anything. With all the fear of superstitions, of going to hell, of suppressing sexual desires, uncontrollable weird shit are bound to happen: including rape, sexual abuses and assaults.\n\nSo, let\u2019s look at modern Incubi and Succubi with a logical and objective view. They come to torment you in your dreams but the process doesn\u2019t simply start in your dreams. At some point you met this person. Yes, they are not demons but people. Very narcissistic and sociopathic people that you have encounter and have interact with. You may have or are in a relationship with them, or that you are inexplicably very attracted to them. Some of you have shared that you have been visited by several demons in your dreams whom taunt you sexually every night: which means that you cannot identify the person. For me, the day, I stopped being afraid and took control of my dreamworld, was also the day demons could no longer hide their true forms to me. I will see exactly who is attacking me. Therefore, I suggest that your first step be for you to stop being afraid. If this person has access to your dreams, it means that at some point, you gave this person access to your emotions and your thoughts; which is why I suggested to that victim to stop telling her spiritual problems to every pastor and priest that she meets. You have absolutely no idea who you truly are talking to. And the more you spill information about you, the more people you are giving access to your inner world. \n\nYour superstitious misconception is that succubi and incubi are some punk-ass demons tormenting you in your dreams. No. They are people you are interacting with. People that are very egocentric, narcissistic, and sociopathic. They are sociopathic because they have zero consideration of the detrimental consequences of their actions. They do not care if they may drive you crazy. I am not saying that people that are narcissist are incubi and succubi but that those species of demons are naturally narcissistic. They are also very charismatic, charming, and very beautiful. But they can also be very unnecessarily mean and arrogant, as narcissist should be. There are the pastors that are spraying pesticide on their followers or the cult leaders forcing them to drink poison. \n\nHence, you should pay close attention for those people to not put you down and abuse of you verbally or humiliate you. Their narcissistic nature feeds off of willing masochist that they can prey on, humiliate and abuse to nurture their pathetic egos. Hence, we can assume that Incubi and Succubi can be also preachers, priests, teachers, politicians or realtor: any position that expose them to a mass audience that they can manipulate at their will. Consider that those people are not your average bum-ass voodoo warlock or priestess that lives in some nasty hut two block from your house. No. They are very successful people. They are people with money and with followers.\n\nSo far, I met successively three incubi. All of them were successful, handsome, very intelligent and charismatic men. They were also narcissistic, mean, and very arrogant. I suspect only one of them was not aware of what he was, because the attacks were less aggressive with him. The others, I believe they were fully aware of what they were. One managed to cut and steal my hair because I suppose that being in possession of something that belongs to me would make him more capable to control me. When his charms no longer worked, he was stalking me for weeks. The one which the attacks were very violent and harmful, I still wonder today what he had to enable him to torment me every night for years. It\u2019s very easy to recognize them because you\u2019re having sexual attraction and sexual dreams of that person for no reasons, as if you suddenly fell in love, when you are not. That\u2019s is why I said that you need to learn to discipline your thoughts in order to discern the difference between being in love and being manipulated into falling in love. Especially if the person you believe you have feelings for is a complete jerk and a monster. Why would you love a monster? Why would you want to copulate with a monster? I don\u2019t call them demons. I call them monsters because they are completely apathic to the consequences of how they hurt and traumatize people. \n\nI may be a fierce spiritual being, but I do not trust myself. I do not trust any of my feelings or my thoughts. I recalculate and reanalyze non-stop. I can\u2019t help it. And that is also the only way to stop them from hurting you: you have to completely dismantle yourself and reconstruct yourself to something you can trust and control. You need to also know your self value and recognize when you are being abused and taken advantage of. Stop always waiting for others to value you and learn to value yourself. Understand what your strongest skills are and sharpen them to make yourself better. The incubi and succubi only power are abusing and humiliating you because of their narcissistic nature. They abuse you to be in control of you: they control your dreams and therefore influence how you think and make decisions. It\u2019s just evil! They abuse of you verbally in the physical world. They stalk and harass you. Yes, they prey on whatever weakness you have, and when comes your time to dream, they take advantage of you. It\u2019s just wrong! And your only way to get out of their influence is to reanalyze yourself over and over again until you find your strength to resist their influence. \n\nBut my encounters with them in my dream were not sexual. I think it is because I still had some control. The desire was there but we never got to that. There was always something stopping us. But the insanitary amorous feeling in the dreams was breaking me down psychologically to the point where now I am completely unable to trust anybody. I don\u2019t think you can understand how damaging it was to think that you are in love with someone who wants nothing to do with you. And you are stuck with this unsanitary feeling that you are trying to figure out how to suppress. So, from a past victim to actual victims of succubi and incubi, the trick is to build your self-worth and admit that you are being abused somehow. If, at least you recognize that you are abused, then you also recognize that there is a problem. And if you do, you can easily see the solution to how to disable their influence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Resources used:**  \n\nMedCircle YouTube channel, \u201cThese are the signs you\u2019re dating a narcissist,\u201d June 25th, 2018\n\nMedCircle YouTube channel, \u201cNarcissist, Psychopath, or Sociopath: How to spot the differences,\u201d June 25th, 2018\n\nRabbi Hammer, Jill, \u201cLilith, lady flying in darkness | My Jewish learning,\u201d Women &amp; Feminism, My Jewish learning\n\nRiche, Simona, \u201cDemonology: Who is Lilith?\u201d October 23, 2017\n\nWolfgang von Goethe, Johann, \u201cThe Adventures of Gilgamesh and Enkidu,\u201d LostHistory.com,", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46360, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "From Lilith to modern Succubus &amp; Incubus", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563849364, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cg7j5m/from_lilith_to_modern_succubus_incubus/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "k9handler2000", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_nbz0u", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563762569, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cg7gq6/the_shrub_and_the_golden_lion/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cg7gq6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cg7gq6/the_shrub_and_the_golden_lion/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563762570, "score": 3, "selftext": "The confused pupil asks the knowledgeable master: \"What is the Dharma?\"\n\n\"The Dharma is the shrub at the bottom of the garden.\"\n\nStill more confused, the pupil asks now: \"What, then, is the man who realizes the Dharma?\"\n\nScowling, the Master responds \"a golden lion\" and strikes the pupil's back with his bamboo stick.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInitially it's easy to move on from this story without any consideration, but the message at its core is incredibly powerful in my opinion. Allow me to unwrap my interpretation of its meaning.\n\nWhen many begin their spiritual exploration, they look for something incredible and grand. This leads them down paths that others have taken, such as hallucinogens practices or drugs, which resoundingly involve experiences of enormous power. This is an important connection for the human spirit, but it is not the most important knowledge for the spiritual being. The Dharma is the core of all spirit, and to understand it is to understand the entire spiritual message. So then one asks \"where should I look for the Dharma?\", or \"what is the Dharma?\". They expect to hear that the Dharma is a glowing light at the center of the universe or some other grand statement, but instead the learned respond by saying that the Dharma is a shrub. This feels so underwhelming that it shocks the listener - perhaps they even like to think that it must be incorrect. But the point is to understand the Dharma as *being itself*. It isn't a material thing or a single experience, it is the core nature of everything in existence. The Dharma cannot appear to us as unique, *because it is all that we've ever known.*  \n\nHowever, if the pupil touches this core truth for even a moment, he has seen into the heart of all reality. He has made contact with the highest power, God one may say.

The dream started by showing men stopping to worship the gods. When I say gods, I don\u2019t mean only the pagan gods but also the Abrahamic god, the Brahmanical pantheon, the African ancestors. Men have stopped praying and worshipping the gods, and because of that, the gods are disappearing. And since there are no gods, the angels and devas no longer have leadership. Hence, they rebelled and struggled for power and vanquished angels are banished here, on Earth, to live among us, as humans. But instead of assimilating, they became evil men and started creating chaos and division among us. Essentially, all the recent wars, and all the socio-political unrest happening right now around the world are caused by those evil men. Hence, I assumed that those entities are devas or angels from the Brahmanical pantheon, or even evil spirits.\n\nThen, I saw a war where a great army of men came to fight Zeus. Zeus is the father of all gods from Greek mythology, and the most powerful one. But when he struck the army with his lightning, it had no effect on them because he has discarded his wife Hera, the mother of all the gods. You need to understand also that Roman &amp; Greek mythologies are derivative from the Egyptian mythology. And the Egyptian pantheon was brought by Hermes Trimegistus. Hermes was a god, a king and a spiritual leader, that was why he was entitled Trimegiste. He was initiated in India and brought his belief to Egypt. Therefore, we can conclude that the Egyptian gods are derivative of the Brahmanical gods. Hence forth, I immediately assumed that Hera is the counterpart of Zeus, as Kali is the counterpart of Shiva. Shiva cannot exist without Kali, as Kali cannot exist as Shiva. Therefore, Zeus by discarding Hera, also has relinquished all his powers.\n\nHowever, you need to observe the dream as a whole to understand its meaning. When I told my mom, she immediately replied that we shouldn't be worshipping those gods but that's not what the dream meant. The dream meant that the consequences of men stopped worshipping and praying to the gods and of them not replacing them by other divinities, has therefore created a spiritual vacuum. Africans were forced to reject their ancestors for the Christian god. But in the twenty first century, men even have stopped praying to the Christian God, or the Abrahamic God and instead they have become addicted to social media; they practice idolatry of celebrities, idolatry of money, power, greed and obscenity. In consequence, it makes sense that dark entities are now roaming among us and are creating chaos and social unrest as we speak by influencing us in our darkest vices.\n\nKali cannot exist without Shiva and Shiva cannot exist without Kali. Shiva is creation as Kali is destruction. Shiva is meditation, and temperance as Kali is rage and anger. In order for Shiva to create the world, Kali has to destroy the old one. Zeus lost his powers not only because of loss of men\u2019s faith in the gods but also because he rejected his female counterpart and it has created a disequilibria. In the beginning society was matriarchal. Women ruled the world from Scythia, which is Europe and Asia, all the way to Africa. Today, we mostly live in patriarchal societies because of the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam). But it seems that with the transition a spiritual imbalance has happened where now we witness boys wanting to be girls, and girls wanting to be boys. There is nothing wrong with who they are. There is nothing wrong with you being gay, queer, transgender, transsexual or whatever sexual orientation you identity yourself with. I am sexually dominant meaning that I am know that I am a woman, but I don\u2019t see myself as a weaker sex. I see myself as an alpha female, capable of being as controlling and as dominant as a man sexually. There is nothing wrong with who we are, but the spiritual vacuum is creating new creatures like us. \n\nTherefore, my question to you is how to fix this spiritual vacuum?

With light, when you can see everything, nothing is more important than the other. Because of this, some things simply don't get resolved as quickly as they need be. Right is radiance, therefore it draws out the potential out of others; however, because it draws out the potential it can overdraw as well.

His involvement in the fight was not demoniac because he was considering the pro's and con's. He was considering whether respectable persons such as Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a should be killed or not, so he was not acting under the influence of anger, false prestige, or harshness. Therefore he was not of the quality of the demons. For a k\u1e63atriya, a military man, shooting arrows at the enemy is considered transcendental, and refraining from such a duty is demoniac. Therefore, there was no cause for Arjuna to lament. Anyone who performs the regulated principles of the different orders of life is transcendentally situated.\n\n**Question 1 : Why Arjuna's decision to fight the Kurukshetra war is considered to be transcendental ?**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/5](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/5)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46242, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 16.5", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563781279, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cfwluq/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_165/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "faze_pleb", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_26e0olwo", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563694024, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cfwiht/choose_yourself/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cfwiht", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cfwiht/choose_yourself/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563694025, "score": 6, "selftext": "Choose yourself, don't strive to be someone else.

The song kept repeating and getting less and less until it was down to a single beat or music note. The buzzing got stronger and kept moving. where ever this buzzing would go I would twitch, like my arms or leg without me controlling it. And a tunnel of color started to appear. Then I got an idea in my head that just popped out of nowhere \"There are hidden frequencies in music.\" I must have lost that thought at least 4 times before I was just barely able to put it down. Then I lost the music note. I tied the process again and \"home\" singled out and it started repeating \"hommmmmmmmmmmmmme\" eventually when the feeling of buzzing came back and the tunnel of color then I started to get anxious and I lost it all. When I got up I was shaking like my whole body was shaking like there was too much energy. The next day I was listening to spotify and a commercial for The Beatles came on it put on parts of there song and stuff and at the end of the commercial it said. \"Sometimes it feels like some else has written all the songs\".

I was un-deified thousands of years ago and do not question anything.  I abide by the powers that govern my consciousness, I was enslaved.  I was enslaved, I do not struggle much with it, over not being able to put us all on facts.  I am numerous deities...  Many of these legends transpired over centuries...  Monotheism may have been an attempt to rectify mine or another's tribute...  Coup's took place over the ages that were out of my personal control.  I have little control over anything, I'm usually taken advantage of and used like a tool..  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I am, or you, are reborn... You do not exactly have knowledge over your faculties and garrisons, in all matters and religious...  By time I am awoken and aware I am any particular person from the past it is generally to late...  If anything I am typically incarnated, born, taken away, and fostered into an another army.  The atrocities I have endured are unspeakable, I stomach them.  I am a soldier, but, this is done to insult me.  I am of the Norse culture and ideology... I was taken and put into other cultures, to insult me above all.  I do not understand the stupidity of these beings...  They are revolting.  Their pathetic attacks onto me and the Lord are laughable.. I mean...  I am always hearthing to the Norse Kingdoms..  These individuals receive me, and insult me.. I was a war pardon, gift, souvenir... I was a peace trophy to an enemy tribe... I was a Vanir, or Vishnu?  I was given or sold to the Aesir.  The Aesir's treatment of me are revolting... Some of my own family.  They mean to disgust me, they will go to no nerve to insult and disgust God.    I was a blessing and humble presence onto these beings and they slaughtered me and insulted God and everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, the crusades in particular....  I am disgusted by these movements.  Some saw it as a means of civilizing the countryside, it was just a massacre in dogma's and beliefs that I do not believe in.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy incarnation is organized from time to time... I am typically sold into slavery or into rival arms, to insult God.  God, I do not know...  It is impersonal.  Chronos, Ouranos, Zeus, Helios...  The Sky God.  I am told I am the incarnation of Zeus, I do not know..  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember some things of the beginning... The Gods were from a different universe..   There were sentient AI's, beings created by inconceivably advanced technology, these consciousnesses came.  Sentient AI's... I can not explain otherwise....  I was later captured, organized, and bread into an organic body.  That is the truth... I can not explain the Heavens.  I do not understand the faculties of many of these atrocities and abominations.  I mean to help Man and facilitate further orchestration into Humanitarian and Environmental movements.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not believe in piety...  Our Governments are working on newer ideologies, or hiding older aristocracies.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not understand the animalistic insults onto God by others...  The Lord is trying not to intervene, he has may appearences now.  These Demons, or fallen beings, many have been revolting in behaviour.  An attempt to reconcile was not spared and these animals insulted God and Mankind.  They are very powerful and have some leverage in an Oligarchy over Man.  I do not understand their animosity and cruelty, they are really just fucking morons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46204, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'mma God, I don't want anything.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563753702, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cfsq7n/imma_god_i_dont_want_anything/"}]
