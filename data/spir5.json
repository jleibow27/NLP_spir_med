Or tell me I\u2019m wrong and why lol! I come from a VERY strong Christian area in the Bible Belt of Texas, but have walked away from religion and formed my own spiritual beliefs. \nSo with that in mind...read on\n\nIf God is not a religion, but a relationship, then it\u2019s understandable that like in human relationships, each persons relationship with God will look completely different from another.\n\nTo be more specific: Coming from a very Christian background, I used to believe this quote to be true, and I still do, but in a *totally* different way, so I get it. But at the same time, coming from the aforementioned Christian background, I understand that this quote is intended to be interpreted within the confines of a religion (ironically). \n\nThese days, my version of a God/divine being and my relationship with him/her/it looks totally different from the one intended by this quote and the one I used to have, yet I still believe it\u2019s true. It\u2019s a relationship with life itself that has baffled and intrigued humans since the beginning of our existence, this dance with the spiritual part of our human consciousness that we desperately try to understand, forcing us to sometimes shove it in a box with the label of \u201cReligion\u201d just to feel like we\u2019ve sorta-kinda got a grip on it and our place in the world lol.\n\nMany people love having the box. It\u2019s plenty and completely enough. It\u2019s comfortable, solid and certain, it\u2019s worked thus far, and keeps your questions answered. You know your place and purpose as a human in this world because that\u2019s part of the walls of the box. And I think that\u2019s completely okay...the box is okay if it works for you.\n\nBut break down the walls of the box and you somehow find that with a little personal investigation, interest, and intent, you connect with this divinity on an entirely new, non-shoved-in-a-box, level. You realize that you are everything, and you are nothing, but it\u2019s beautiful. There is just your mind, your experience, and the present moment, yet you also understand that everything is intricately connected-from the tiniest ant, to the oldest tree, to the entirety of existence-it is all one. We are all one. This understanding allows minds to wander, to accept and fully appreciate that \u201call we know is that we know nothing\u201d..and that it\u2019s okay! If all our questions were answered, there would be no questions left to ask and no room for curiosity. Science wouldn\u2019t exist to try to explain and answer our questions in a concrete way (could science be another box? Idk). People wouldn\u2019t philosophize and our collective knowledge would never grow.\n\nAgree? Disagree? Have something to add?

Above it are some lights w/ pictures attached. I arranged the lights w/ my bf and they made the shape of a bat so I keep the lights like that and have ever since. It\u2019s a nice shape. Pleasing to my eye. \n\nAnyway, one time I went to use the bathroom and my boyfriend was in my room alone. While I was gone he said he saw something w/ wings, it took the shape of the lights above my altar and kept morphing into other things. It wasn\u2019t creepy. It was just looking at him, not in anger or happiness. Just a neutral state and felt like it knew I made the altar for it according to my bf. It looked at him just to check him out, to see if he was good or not. Asking for approval to be there or near me we think? In my mind maybe a guardian, but it may not be just for me. We aren\u2019t sure. I didn\u2019t see it, but I have always believed in angels. I have always felt the presence of spirits for as long as I could remember. I\u2019ve welcomed them as long as they do no harm. \nI know you don\u2019t have to be religious to believe in angels. I just always have. \n\nMy bf told me the wings were blackish. I asked him if it could have been the angel of death( yes I know black doesn\u2019t have to mean death.) He said he didn\u2019t get that vibe. Whatever it is just wants to show it\u2019s presence and appreciation for the altar. \nOh also, I don\u2019t think it had a gender. He did say more masculine leaning, but honestly it was morphing or shifting so much that he couldn\u2019t tell. I was going to try and sketch some of it, but I can\u2019t get much detail from my bf. He remembers bits of it, but it again, morphed so fast. It didn\u2019t have one visual state. I asked if he thinks I would consider it to be beautiful or scary and he said not scary, but yea he thinks I would find it beautiful. \n\nI\u2019ve worked hard to keep my room a safe space and somewhere where I can relax and feel separate from the hostile feeling of the rest of my house. It\u2019s worked great. Something about knowing what he saw just makes me happy. Maybe it\u2019s no angel.

I always considered myself in the search for answers on life's biggest questions and I was crazy about philosophy. I'm a Christian but I only practiced a bit as a child and then stopped because of too many other things I was reading.\nI was always very sensitive and I am fighting depression and anxiety for many years. I was always too scared of getting too much into spirituality for fear of losing contact with reality.\nOne night in my bed, I was going through one of the toughest times in my life and I started praying/talking to God, asking for help and for life to get better. I was just lying there, not on my knees or something. I never knew how to imagine God, I just felt like I was praying more to something that was listening from inside my mind rather than outside.\nAnd then my heart started to beat like crazy and I felt like all my body was getting very warm and I don't know how to explain it, but it felt like every empty space in my cells was filled by something, something very warm and bright, like love or a sense of belonging and being all with one. Tears started to drip down my face and I didn't reach this feeling ever again, only vaguely.\nI wanted to ask, did this ever happen to any of you? Was it just my mind playing tricks on me? I would be very grateful for any answer.

I haven\u2019t been practicing or training or even following a lifestyle that would promote a strong intuition. \n\nFor example: Whenever, and I mean whenever, I think of a person, I either see them in real life, they text/call me, or I see something that they posted on social media literally seconds after I thought of them. Also, I\u2019ve started to pick up on how my friends/random peoples emotions. They could be acting perfectly normal and I just get this feeling that something is up or something happened to them (and I\u2019ve been right every time).\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is related, but I\u2019ve been feeling dizzy and loopy at random times. Kind of like my body is here but my headspace is off in wonderland. My body randomly gets numb and tingly and I feel like I\u2019m dreaming and none of this is real.\n\nThe most recent thing really scared me. For the past day or two I\u2019ve been getting this weird, melancholy feeling about my grandma. I always think that I need to call her and spend time with her because she\u2019s going to die soon. Until about a half hour ago, I thought she was very healthy and would have no reason to worry. I was listening in on a conversation between my parents, and they were talking about how she isn\u2019t doing well and just went on dialysis.\n\nI literally just stood there with a gaping mouth because I just couldn\u2019t believe that I \u201cpredicted\u201d this. I\u2019ve been getting a lot of signs recently related to death or something of that nature. Like I\u2019ll get random YouTube ads or random TV commercials about \u201chow I\u2019m not going to survive very long\u201d (granted, it\u2019s Halloween season but still creepy). \n\nI\u2019ve been feeling super weird and just on edge ever since I\u2019ve noticed my intuition increase. Almost like something is in the air or something is off with the atmosphere/universe. I can\u2019t explain it, it just feels weird and off putting. Like I\u2019m bracing for something bad to happen (not just personal to me, but like a large scale kind of thing). \n\nI know this is super long, I just didn\u2019t know where else to go. Why has my intuition all of a sudden increased so much without me even trying? I\u2019ve never been into anything metaphysical/spiritual until this started happening to me. Is this like a sign or something? \n\nTl;dr My intuition has significantly increased without me trying or attempting to increase it.

That is a teacher and healer. Know that by this realization of self, acceptance of who I am that I have come to terms with things within myself and our family dynamic that may or may not cause you to become upset or frustrated. Know that first and foremost, I am not denying you nor God. I simply have my own relationship that is not strictly held to the bible. I realize I found reflections of God in people. Beautiful, authentic and gifted people who have entered my life when I truly called for them and was answered in my asking. I acknowledge what Christianity has done for you. I respect that God changed your life for the absolute better, your perceptions of life have expanded, your trauma in this life is healing and everything encompassing that. I accept and acknowledge that God is real, however, our view of God is different and that\u2019s ok. It\u2019s okay that you want to read the bible and review/relay its texts, just as its okay for me to find knowledge in the people who are a reflection of god. God is good, patient, understanding, forgiving, humble, self-aware, positive, etc. God is in people. I\u2019m learning that it\u2019s okay that I seek healing in holistic ways, holding patience with myself to heal parts of me I never knew needed tending to. It\u2019s okay that I sit for long periods of time in front of an altar in my room where I have photos of Markesha, Grandma, friends who have passed. It\u2019s okay that I sit for hours and meditate on things that bother me, things that encourage me, things that need addressing quietly. It\u2019s okay that I spend time and speak to grandma as if she\u2019s sitting right in front of me. I\u2019m not praying to her, I\u2019m communing with her just as we all speak to her every once in a while. Her spirit never leaves us, her energy never fades. Her impact carries over to her next life in whichever form that may be but I know she hears me, I know Markesha hears me, I know friends and ancestors who have passed hear me as does God. I find peace in that and the answers.\n \nI\u2019ve learned to truly forgive. I have been able to finally and truly understand and forgive my father with this. I understand that he is on his own path, whether it is a good path or a bad path, I don\u2019t label it. Yes, the impact of his walk has in ways harmed me but it was necessary for my personal growth, as you say God would not place things in my walk of life if I couldn\u2019t handle them. I developed codependency issues from my father, I\u2019ve worked hard to release that and not assign my emotions and angst to be the responsibility of potential relationship partners. I\u2019ve ignored signs just as you felt you did when it came to my father about certain traits people show of themselves that should alarm you, I\u2019ve gotten myself into situations I should have never been in and were extremely harmful but was necessary to get me to where I am now. I've also forgiven the woman and young boy in middle who touched me inappropriately growing up as I don\u2019t hold resentment towards them as well as myself. The anger I held towards them wasn\u2019t for them, it was for me. I've healed that part of myself and the biggest forgiveness I've come to terms with was for you. I spent a lot of my life wondering why you do some of the things you do, why you hold sadness so close to you, I see it every time I look at you. The loneliness you cover yourself with. You've carried the guilt of the way my father treated me as if it was your own doing and that\u2019s never the case and never how I saw it even when I was young. You cannot control how someone treats someone else, you can only control your reaction to it and you struggled to show me compassion without becoming angry at him for the things he did. If you are still holding on to that, let it go. If you are still holding on to the frustration or anger because you don\u2019t understand why I walk a path that doesn\u2019t reflect closely of yours, let it go. Everyone\u2019s path on this planet is their own and of their own timing of how they impact this world, the people around them and themselves. If you continue to hold negative emotions of any kind or of any reason, know that those are for you. Not me. I refuse to let anyone dictate how I perceive this world, how I learn, how I heal and how I speak for myself.\n \nPersonal relationships are my path to development, knowledge, and awakening.  Having people in my life to converse and reflect with is so important for me. I have people around that have so many different walks of life and understandings of this world, the energy it holds and the traumas it has endured. I have spent time with Native America elders, healers who are my age but wise beyond their years, therapists and life coaches of color, teachers in school, pastors of small and large congregations. I\u2019ve spent time in colored rooms, working with chakras, sacral frequencies and understanding my bodies responses. I\u2019ve I gathered wisdom all these experiences gave me with payment of respect to come to slow realizations that I\u2019ve been untrue to myself in the way I approach life, digest trauma, and react to every occurrences. I will be attending a Buddhist inspired and nonsectarian college called Naropa University in Boulder Colorado for my B.A in Contemplative psychology once I finish my associates in Psychology at Front Range Community college next year. Only when I live authentically for ME do I attain fulfillment, happiness and satisfaction within myself. Every day I learn something new and it taken me this long to realize I have a story to tell about my walk thus far that is growing richer and richer. I long to share that with others and offer another perception of life other than their own. I care what others think, but because of my unusual nature and open center, people are prone to not seeing me the way I would like to be seen. I struggled with understanding why people don\u2019t see the world as I do, I can say the same for you too. I'm learning to be okay with that, you may not see me in the way I hope for you to see me but people remember me and it\u2019s become so apparent with the people that have come back in my life from childhood. I make impacts on people, even as a child. I preferred to speak with the people, expand my preconceived notions of life through conversation. I preferred to work to heal my ancestral trauma by diving into ancestry and reflect on how I function in this body of energy and reflect on how my family operates with theirs. Our ancestors have endured things beyond your imagination and understanding and that does without a doubt carry over through generations. Cultivating a space within myself and those around me to be okay with you they are and not what other intended, directed or forced them to be. You walk your own path not someone else\u2019s and no matter what plan you had for me when you had me and path you intended and wanted for me to walk, know that I have always walked to the beat of my own drum and I\u2019ve walked with my heart and spirit leading me. I\u2019ve never walked with my mind as it will lead me to anything and everything. My sacral responses are a necessity for me. This letter I\u2019m writing to you is a response to the question of why do you not walk the path as I do? Why do you not read the bible every day or often as I do. Why do you not attach yourself to negative emotions people have against you and instead forgive without expectation or explanation. Why do you not subconsciously judge others when they don\u2019t believe in your God? My answer: I was never meant to.\n \nI have never been confined even as a child, I never allowed myself to be because you taught me I was unique and different. That it was never bad to be this way. Things I taught you before I knew what 'teaching' was, you knew I was different and you tried to point me in a direction of asking God, an otherworldly being , someone beyond you for answers because you didn\u2019t know how to address me and my coming of awareness. God doesn\u2019t answer you with words, instead God answers in signs, life events and people. I always thought different than others and it shows even more so now as an adult. I remember as a child, I didn\u2019t understand why you couldn\u2019t see me for who I was even still not knowing who I was. I knew I wasn\u2019t being acknowledged in the right way. I wasn\u2019t being addressed as the authentic little ball of whatever I was. What I am isn\u2019t encompassed in a mere word, what I was meant to be isn\u2019t defined by a religious preference, it is just who I am. The life you may have thought or assumed would be the best for me, that is for you. Not me and it is not the way God has intended for me. You just instilled in me the consciousness of being self-aware, morals to know what is societally right and wrong, and tools to expand my understanding. It is ultimately up to me to know which way to go and not knowing is the way for me to go. Everything in life does not involve an answer, I don\u2019t need to know where I\u2019ll end up in my afterlife or what my dream job looks like. My perception of life now is that I will end up where I\u2019m meant to be. What you've taught me about perception is that perception in the absence of judgment gives room for spiritual guidance and understanding. I no longer judge myself of how I walk my life, I hold my life to no standard other than being who I am supposed to be and so long as my choices do not physically harm anyone and I am authentically being me to the fullest capacity, I am okay with myself. With that I've fully come to an understanding of discernment. When I hold no judgment not just of other people but for myself, I'm able to see others clearly as well as myself and show up authentically and unapologetically. I am tired of  living a false life I know I will never fit in. I'm not the typical Christian child and you know that.\n \nWhat is this letter for? Nothing more than for me to share my experience of an awakening of sorts and acknowledgement of self. I want you know that everything in this letter is with intentions of love and understanding. Know that this is my form of giving back to my community, myself, you, our family and our ancestral lineage. Know that I feel so grateful to finally have clarity on what my life experiences are meant to be taken as, I hold no negative emotions in my being and I feel free.  I love you with everything in me but I want you to understand and know that I do not walk the same path as you and no one does in this world aside from you. I own my path as my own and know that yours is yours.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 63603, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Breaking my rejection of Christianity to my Mom", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572164045, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dkpu3a/breaking_my_rejection_of_christianity_to_my_mom/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "HappySoulHungryMind", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3hlqdcpe", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571604638, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dkpna2/no_expectations/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dkpna2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dkpna2/no_expectations/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571604641, "score": 8, "selftext": "When it comes to the spiritual path, we must realize it takes its own course. \n\nIn the material world, we use words such as control and timeframe.

I don\u2019t have the typical story of how when I was a kid weird things would happen to me. Don\u2019t consider myself gifted however I know I\u2019m an old soul. \n\nNow, a little over a week ago, someone messaged me from my city on fb. I have felt completely comfortable and oddly connected with him even though I didn\u2019t really know him. But there are some coincidences like we went to the same middle school back then and we both burned our hands when we were little- his on the inside of his palm, mine on the top of my hand. \n\nHe is spiritually inclined. He knows his souls purpose, does energy healing and helps his friends and family. He is in a sense leading the way for me. After about 6 days I went to see him. There was an intense energy in me and I\u2019m sure for him too. He isn\u2019t who I\u2019d typically date appearance wise and go for. But it\u2019s like I don\u2019t even care. It feels different because it\u2019s not strictly external or superficial. I\u2019m rolling with it. When I slept he did reiki on me (with my consent). This whole thing just feels magical and like I\u2019m dreaming. \n\nHe told me to stay in the present moment because I\u2019m always asking questions lol. Repeats that meditation is key. I wonder if he\u2019s a soulmate or twin flame. But I know I really shouldn\u2019t put labels on it. He came out of nowhere, I don\u2019t even need to speak when I\u2019m with him I just feel his presence and listen to his voice. It\u2019s crazy because we\u2019re sort of from the hood lol so you don\u2019t hear about things like this. I\u2019m just glad the universe brought him to me. I\u2019m learning from him everyday. I can\u2019t really explain this to my friends and family because they won\u2019t understand, so I\u2019d rather not. what do you guys think of this? I\u2019m interested in hearing your input.

guided to actions that can make a real positive difference in the world.  These actions are NEVER against anything.  They are always for something.  \n\n\"Black Lives Matter\" is a great case in point.  It is for caring about black lives.  They do not say don't care about others' lives, but bring forth something that needs attention.  The same as if one of your fingers was infected.  You care about all your fingers, but that particular finger needs extra attention.\n\nAs spiritual people, being against racism doesn't help... doesn't create the kind of Oneness we know can exist in the world.  But, being for diversity does.  The difference is gigantic and leads to a plethora of different actions that really can help, instead of demonizing folks and creating more separation.\n\nI speak on diversity quite a bit at my church.  When I first arrived, a little over 2 years ago at my present church, over 95% were white.  Now, on any given Sunday, 30-60% are not.  As a white male, doing my best to be an ally for diversity, I feel pretty good about that.  Add to that the foster kids we host for movie nights and a Christmas party and the homeless families we feed that are in a program that succeeds in getting 90% off the streets and into apartments and jobs.\n\nWe've also been moved to make short films where white folks look at the deeper, insidious ways white folks carry on racism without knowing it.\n\nLook into your life and see what you're against.  See if you can find what you're for instead... action from what you're for is so much more powerful and feels so much better.\n\nlove you;\n\nRev.

I have not been to church and I have never believed in or worshiped any god-like figure. \n\nThis last few weeks, I have had a very stressful workload and have been feeling depressed. I have a long history of mental illness and when I become unwell, I struggle to function and do not find enjoyment in anything, even my hobbies such as cycling. Last night, I was in an extremely dark place and I lay in bed in the dark alone contemplating how isolated I felt and I didn\u2019t want to be here anymore.\n\nThis morning, I woke quite early and I felt a pull to go for a walk, so I did. This wasn\u2019t particularly unusual as I often walk so I didn\u2019t think anything of it. My route took me past the local church. As I walked past, I saw a group of people entering and I felt compelled to approach. These people were immediately friendly and receptive, and I felt a sudden wave of relief and homeliness, as if I had arrived somewhere that I was meant to be. I agreed to stay for a service.\n\nThe speaker shared with us a story of his own personal breakdown due to a heavy workload last year. He shared his emotions and hardships and I felt a kinship with this man. He read passages from the bible and prayed with us and shared his own recovery story about how he had taken refuge in God. At the end of his speech, the church prayer team came to the front and shared that we need to vent, we need to support each other and lean on each other in our times of need instead of pulling away. This resonated with me so strongly that I started to have tears in my eyes. They said that if we ever feel alone and need help, the church is here always and God is here always to help and restore us. \n\nAfter the service, I met an older couple who come from the same part of the country I do. The man was a cyclist, like me when I am well. They were very kind and invited me to come over to see their bike garage and have a cup of tea. I went over and talked to the man about his bikes and he gave me some free winter cycling clothes because it\u2019s freezing around here recently. I felt a sudden connection and urge to get back to cycling ASAP. I spent about an hour and a half with the couple, who were very friendly and had funny stories to tell. \n\nWhen I left, I felt reinvigorated and refreshed. I felt so full of love and appreciation. I don\u2019t know where I will go from here or really what this means for me, but I do know that God hears me and guided me this morning when I woke earlier than planned. I felt the power of his healing and love. I am so grateful.\n\nThank you for reading!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 63525, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Today, I received healing from God", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572158040, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dkjiu3/today_i_received_healing_from_god/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "dgra12", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3fcnloq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571568822, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dki4sw/has_anybody_felt_this_emptiness_before/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dki4sw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dki4sw/has_anybody_felt_this_emptiness_before/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571568823, "score": 2, "selftext": "Ive been awakened since 3 years ago but ss of lately ive been more interested in spirituality than even .

I still think of what is going on at a spiritual level but tbh I dont think theres anything to this like not a lesson to learn nor a positive outcome.

You've made the egregious mistake of thinking you were this body, and the things that it does. What Jesus and Buddha pronounced is that there is only one object which can meaningfully be identified with: the Creator itself. Any barriers we experience are generated by the chatter of the brain which our experience owes itself to; the Realization is that our consciousness is of the same Ground as the fabric and material of our universe, of the very process of causation itself. You are the force which brings about both the mountains and the mind; in this is the Truth that the mountain is *of you*, that it is your creation. \n\nThere are those who understand this Truth and those who corrupt it. If one identifies their body as a vessel for God, and the purpose of this universe as service to their worldly form, they have grossly misinterpreted this relationship. Our nature is formless; we are *not* this experience we are currently having, but rather the Ground that experience itself exists upon. Those who understand the Truth identify themselves with the person opposite to them, with the Lotus flower, the passage of time, and the whole of Existence itself, but they never claim to \"own\" it. They understand their self as a passing phenomenon, continually arising anew without explanation or reason. \n\nConsider for a moment that every time I have mentioned a supposed \"You\", I am really calling out to myself. You and I are  two perspectives of the same moment - the same ceaseless and continuous universe experiencing itself from two separate perspectives. Just like the left and right eye see difference views but relate to the same body, you and I see different views yet are the same. \n\nSo, **hello, Me!** I could say the same while looking out at the stars. \n\nOur cultures have conditioned our brains to rear away from this kind of thinking. The concept of identifying yourself with the Creator is associated with insanity and narcissism. Christians seem to have made one sole exception with Jesus Christ, usually ignoring his message that It is each of us (and each of us are It). Buddhists are much more subtle in their description of this, identifying with the Emptiness which all phenomena evaporate into instead of the phenomena itself. Whatever the tradition, those who tear through the veil of the mind in order to examine existence exactly as it is will all tell you the same thing. \n\nThe key is to begin questioning whether you are your thoughts. Once you see that they arise just like every other phenomenon, coming from the unknown and immediately returning to it, you realize that there is only one continuum of \"happenings\", and your thoughts cannot be separated from it. They may be \"yours\" but they are not \"you\". Next you turn to find the \"viewer\" of these happenings; surely *that* is you! A \"Soul\" or \"Tiny person\" in your head viewing the universe. But, the more you look, the more illusive the viewer; you come to find that it was merely an illusion. Finally, you come to realize that you *are* that happening. The thoughts in your mind or the flame in front of you come from the same Ground; you are not observing your experience but you *are* that experience, as well as the Ground from which that experience projects itself. \n\nJust as you do not worry about where the fire goes when you put it out, allow this body to carry this experience until it fades out. Nothing is lost because nothing is gained; you are not any one form, but Existence itself. Notice that I use many different names to describe what we are (Emptiness, Ground, It, Source, the Creator, Existence); these are all merely clues to point your exploration in the right direction. To understand who you truly are, you must come into direct contact with it. Learn to live this Truth, and you will be reunited with yourself.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 63464, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hello, Me!", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572153880, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dketna/hello_me/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "PaigeJourdan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3yi3scfq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571537688, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dkdhu4/awakening_and_questions/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dkdhu4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dkdhu4/awakening_and_questions/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571537689, "score": 6, "selftext": "This awakening is uncomfortable.

Ever since I have started, I have seen a decline in my physical health and even on my spiritual or energy body as well.

Do they keep us out of reaching our potential?\n\nI'm seeking these answer out of the context of self love. I love the person I am and who I've become but it's the things like this that make me think that maybe I don't love myself as much as I thought. Would I truly be smoking cigarettes if I truly loved myself? I guess that's more of a question for me to meditate on.\n\nAny and all answers are welcome.

As a matter of fact, I remember so many times when I was in agonizing pain and begging god to help me (at that time I was a Christian, and Christianity messed me up really bad to the point where I have PTSD, partly because of it, it fed my traumatic experience) and it felt like I was praying to a wall. I felt no love, no peace, no balance, no joy, except when I took Ativan... And I don't think benzodiazepines are the answer to your spiritual health. I tried all the \"Christian stuff\" and none of it worked.\n\nI do not believe Christianity is the answer... But that doesn't mean I don't believe in some sort of higher power.\n\nFast forward to around 6 months ago, I started to get answered prayers. It was so weird, I just opened my mind a little, scared (because of my experience), but somewhat ready to just try and open up spiritually, and I just started to picture a higher power without \"picturing\", I put no face on it, no gender, no personality, nothing. I tried to pray.\n\nIt's always subtle, it's always something that I could write off if I wanted to, and maybe it's just coincidental or self-fulfilling prophecy . But I am really sensitive to most things emotionally, mentally, and spiritually(not super sure about that one since I'm spirituality confused), and it's leaving me wondering. \n\nNow, I can't really say that I feel any \"presence\" of anything when I pray, I don't, *UNLESS*, there is something going on like wind, or sound, especially those two, if I subtly meditate on it and feel *THAT*, I feel like whatever higher power is out there IS the wind and sound. My brother explained it to me that we all are part of one giant \"organism\" (not his words) and we're just existing as part of the flow of all that is.\n\nSo, any thoughts?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 63437, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I keep getting answered prayers.

There is only ever this moment, right? past and future is always in this moment, right? Memory is just a past now remembered from the present, right? So there is only this moment, and this moment can never be anything other than this moment. It can be a different thing the next moment, infinite different things, but now it is only what it is right now. right? \n\nIt's always this moment. Eternity is in this moment, it is never anything else. Reality in this moment is truth. It cannot be anything other than what it is. Your ability to accept this moment and deal with it as it is, that is the door to happiness. Your door to life, happiness, creation, and creator, it is all in this moment. isn't it? \n\nIf what is in the past, or the future, is hurting you, then something that is not real is hurting you. isnt it? How can something that is not real be hurting you? It is happening through your mind, and your mind is what is hurting you. Your mind is not right now, it is always in the past or future, isnt it? \n\nBy learning to be with this moment, you ease the pain that comes from your mind that is coming from your distance to this moment. When you are in this moment, you are not bothered by the mind. When you succeed in meditation, it is peaceful and blissful because you have finally become freed from your mind. right? \n\nThis moment is truth. It can only ever be what is happening right now. Everything that happens is happening right now. Your ability to be in touch with truth and stay with truth is the door to many mysteries. \n\nYour suffering, mind, and your distance from truth (right now) are all related. \n\nWhen you accept what is right now, you are happy, right? When what you want is what is happening right now, you accept right now fully, and you are happy, right? \n\nWhen your mind takes you to the past or present, you are less accepting of now and less happy, right?

To be free from suffering, you just need to be in this moment. \n\nMeditation is the easiest way to tame the mind and be with this moment. Meditation teaches you a skill that once you are proficient in, you can begin to use outside of meditation. To awaken is to be in touch with truth, with this moment, for all eternity. For now, you may experience a couple moments of awakening in your life, but most of it is just mind and things that do not exist (maya, illusion, that which is not this moment). Until you learn the skill of being in this moment eternally (through acceptance and surrender), you will only experience have brief windows of awakening (being totally accepting of and conscious of this moment). It is a skill that takes time and effort to learn, but it is also more than a skill. A skill is something you do, and awakening is something that is already there, you just need to learn how to be open to it (accept and surrender). Also you must deal with the karma that you have associated to you if you want to have a fighting chance at awakening. Like all things, the karma can only be dealt with in this moment too! When you learn to deal with your karma, it becomes easier to be in this moment. And also, the more you are in this moment, the easier it becomes to deal with karma and the more you want to deal with karma head on. \n\nBeing able to understand karma, mind, and this moment will help you deal with a great number of difficulties in your life.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 63395, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Truth is what is right now - teachings from Sadhguru with commentary from me", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572148276, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dk8pod/truth_is_what_is_right_now_teachings_from/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "is_reddit_useful", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_12hppb", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571513219, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dk8f3p/do_you_think_there_is_something_beyond_the_oneness/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dk8f3p", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dk8f3p/do_you_think_there_is_something_beyond_the_oneness/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571513220, "score": 7, "selftext": "One possible way of understanding reality is that this is one consciousness which has split into countless pieces in order to experience things and play with itself. The splits themselves create the amazing complexity we see in the world around us. We all remain connected in some ways, which can seem non-obvious, but may be very obvious if you really pay attention.\n\nReligion then might simply be things we are constructing in the collective unconscious. Gods might seem very real, but only be constructions coming from the imagination and faith of the believers. These phenomena would then be another way we play games with ourselves, and not some fundamental truth about reality. The only fundamental truth may be that oneness.\n\nMaybe the most spiritually meaningful aspects of all religions simply reduce to this oneness, and things one might conclude from that.\n\nI'm not sure that is all though. Could there be something else out there? Like, basically, the oneness is the entirety of the current simulation, but there is also some \"outside\", which is running the simulation. Then, whatever is running the simulation would probably be the real meaning of God. I'm not saying it's something which we're capable of understanding necessarily. Some religions actually make that point regarding God, but nevertheless seem to claim to understand God in various ways.\n\nSometimes I've felt like love is the most clear evidence for that outside. Basically, without love reality seems to be a like a complex system of \"mirrors\". I don't mean things which reflect what exists, but which reflect things in a way which complicates them, creating the sort of fractal complexity with see around us. Maybe reality sucks when it is only a reflection like that. Maybe you could also compare that to spending a lot of time in a computer game without actually playing the main story of the game.\n\nThis also relates to the human debate of whether life has some particular meaning, or its meaning is only whatever you make of it.\n\nIt could all really be a complex system of delusion trying to forget how that oneness is the fundamental nature of reality.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 63393, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do you think there is something beyond the oneness?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572147844, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dk8f3p/do_you_think_there_is_something_beyond_the_oneness/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Ryan_0224", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4cufg9om", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571511742, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dk83cc/how_do_you_stop_yourself_from_being_judgmental/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dk83cc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dk83cc/how_do_you_stop_yourself_from_being_judgmental/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571511743, "score": 2, "selftext": "A lot of the time , when I see a stranger on the street I cant help but judge their appearance.

Maybe with different words and in different contexts, but in the end, All does indeed become One. \n\n\n\nTo Love, everything fully, without any attachment or desire. To many of us, just even trying to imagine this concept might stir up a lot of confusion, both in our minds and hearts. Perhaps it might sound like a very Buddhist thing to say. Since, after all, isn't Love supposed to be pure Connection? Is it then possible, to be Connected and yet not attached? It almost sounds like an oxymoron, however it is not.  \n \n \nMost Love that happens to people almost always ends up becoming attached love - full of desires, sharp ups and downs, expectations, plenty of euphoria and plenty of sorrow. This, I do not call real Love. In fact, modern psychology has even created a term around this phenomena called [Limerence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerence). It is the typical form of \"love\" that we feel as young teens, with butterflies in our stomachs and obsessive thoughts about the other. \n \n \nThe more intense this type of \"love\" becomes, the more potential it has to stir up great amounts of suffering, and may easily become toxic to all those who are involved. It becomes just like any other addiction. Again, a few simple Buddhist words may explain all of this - pleasures and attachment lead to suffering. From this perspective, it's easy to see how this form of love may never be truly \"real\", for it's a lost cause from the beginning, no matter how deep and amazing it may seem to those experiencing it, especially in the honeymoon phase.  \n\n \nTo Love without attachment requires a certain level of spiritual, mental and emotional maturity. Perhaps this is one lesson that's extremely hard to explain or to teach, without the student learning it through first-hand experience. An experience of that deep, attached love is most probably also necessary in order to be able to transcend it. \n \n \nMost people are never whole on their own, and always try to find their \"other half\" out in the world. Many of them become desperate, and after many failed attempts to love deeply, they feel more alone than ever. However, the first step is to embrace this aloneness. By surrendering to the pain of the realization that we'll never be whole by trying to seek Love outside of ourselves, the pain ceases and transforms into change.  \n \n \nIt's up to us to cultivate and facilitate this change. However, our Will must be pure. And for this, we must also surrender to the Will of God, taking upon ourselves the lifelong task of Loving everything truly, endlessly and without judgement. Whatever needs to come our way, we let it come; whatever needs to go, we let it go. We strive to never long after something that's either in the past or the future, but not in the present moment, otherwise we corrupt this innocent form of Love, making it all become self-deluding and attached. \n\n\nIn relationships, real Love is rare, but it can be achieved and maintained. For this, both of the people involved in the relationship must have a very clear understanding of what Love is, and what it's not. To form some rational boundaries may be helpful, especially in the beginning. Real Love must never truly know any boundaries, for it is infinite and ever-present, but in practice, healthy human relationships must always have some clearly defined boundaries. On another plane, eg. the spiritual, these can be easily transcended, and unity with Infinity reached, forming two Souls into One, both together and separately. \n \n\n \nAwareness, pure reason, maturity, openness, non-jealousy, respect and giving without owning are all keywords to real Love. Those who truly understand the meaning of these expressions will also be able to understand and experience Love more deeply. Love is an endless pool of Energy, one of the two key elements of the Truth/God, and from it we can always channel through ourselves that which truly is, without owning it, wanting more of it, feeling less of it or having any doubts about it. Real Love is something you never own, and thus never lose. How could it be separated from one point to another, if, after all, it's Infinite? \n\n \n \nA good way of practicing the channeling of this non-attached, infinite Love that has come to me recently in meditation. Go out and find someone who very much seems like they're deprived of love, almost \"unloveable\" in a sense, and open up to them. Not obsessively, just sincerely, honestly and without judgement. You don't know their history, or whether they're good or bad people, and you don't need to, either. Just look them straight in the eye and listen to whatever they have to say. You don't need to expose any vulnerable part of yourself to them, but whenever you speak, make sure that you apply both infinite Love and Pure Reason to your thoughts/speech. That way, you're only going to be channeling the Truth, and the person will naturally feel it after a while. This, if done correctly, will reveal to them a part of themselves that they've probably been missing for a very long time, and will either reject it completely or be able to open up to it, learn from it and grow from it.  \n \n \n\nI could go on endlessly trying to explain what Love is and what it isn't, but I feel like I don't need to anymore, for most of what I've written down in this post rings true and seems to do justice to the teaching, at least for now. If any of you feel that you have something meaningful to add to the topic, or a question to ask, please go ahead and I'll do my best to answer truthfully.  \n \n \nAs a closing word, let me share with you an incredible vocal improvisation on the topic, by the late Brent Mydland of the Grateful Dead.

have had two experiences that are hard to explain, but i will try my best. i want to hear similar experiences others have had to compare because i have heard that they are usually very similar. both of my experiences were the exact same under different circumstances. \n\nthe first one happened when i was 17 years old. i had lost my granddad, someone i consider my soulmate, two years prior. we used to fold laundry together in his basement and \u201cour song\u201d was chasing cars by snow patrol. (side note: he was states away at his time of death and i happened to be in the car at that time when chasing cars began to play on the radio and i asked my mom to turn it up) on one seemingly normal day i was in my own basement folding laundry. i don\u2019t really know what happened leading up to this point but suddenly i felt a wave of warmth, security, and pure holy love wash over me. i wasn\u2019t crying but the tears were pouring out of my eyes. i felt my soul being held by someone or something\u2019s love. the only thing i could think to do was sing chasing cars by snow patrol. i didn\u2019t care to sound good or in tune, something was just urging me to sing and immerse myself in the experience. (interestingly enough, this is very similar to how i felt doing DMT). \n\nthe second experience was during the hardest point of my life, in a week or so it will have been a year. i had just gotten out of a year long abusive relationship. i was knee deep in drug addiction. i started a binge on my birthday that just never stopped. i had lost all control and will to move on. i overdosed and it landed me in psych. i spent an extended period there due to complications with medications. i made many friends. two of these friends touched my heart in a particular way. a late 20s-early 30s year old man named Brian, and an 80 year old woman named Karen. Brian was also an addict of a different kind and Karen suffered severe depression. We became a family in our short time together. we looked out for each other and shared many laughs. one day during free time i was sitting at a table and Brian and Karen were sitting across from me. Karen was venting to Brian about how she never picked up any hobbies in life, never had anything that was truly hers. and now her husband has passed, and sure she had grandkids, but she had nothing that brought her joy as her own individual conscious body. i was observing this intimate moment very closely and a feeling entered my body that i will never forget: i felt like i was looking into my future. i don\u2019t know why these were the events that lead to this experience but once again, it washed over me. it felt like i had been dunked into a pool of love and comfort and radiance. like i was an infant and my mother was holding me telling me, \u201cthings are hard, but they\u2019re going to be okay. i am with you.\u201d. again, i wasn\u2019t crying, but my face was wet. my eyes were wet. i felt whole in that moment and it was so intense that i did eventually begin to sob... Karen apologized over and over again and all i could say was \u201ci think i just felt God. karen you have led me to God\u201d. it was such a moving experiences that nurses came to me in tears, sharing their spiritual experiences. it was one of the most beautiful moments of my life. \n\ni have been agnostic and borderline atheist from the time i could think for myself. there was so much dissonance in my mind and i couldn\u2019t understand it. i\u2019m a woman of science and empiricism. i don\u2019t believe in these fairytales, i thought. i thought by not believing in god, that i was keeping the doors to the House of Questions open. but after this experience i realized i had been stuck in the same room for so long. it was freeing. i don\u2019t know where i stand as far as spirituality these days, i\u2019m not one for organized religion as the authoritarian and fear-based doctrine is what turned me away from God\u2019s love for so long. all i know now is that there are many more rooms to explore in this Home of mine and life feels renewed. since that moment my life has completely turned around. my life is beautiful now, and full of love. \n\ni guess i want to hear others\u2019 stories if they\u2019ve had similar experiences and thoughts about what they could be. is this just an emotional response to some stressor? can it be explained by science? is it something more metaphysical, like instead of our normal day-to-day sipping from the conscious pool; we had been fully immersed and reborn in it?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 63338, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Spiritual Experiences", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572141670, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dk1rk1/spiritual_experiences/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "joemaro", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_56ifo", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571479226, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dk1q32/podcast_episode_about_what_spirituality_means/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dk1q32", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dk1q32/podcast_episode_about_what_spirituality_means/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571479227, "score": 2, "selftext": "In this episode, i talk about the context in which i see the term spirituality and how it relates to the world and to the body.

The universe delivers what you have been thinking and focusing based on your energic vibration.\n\nThings that show up in your reality are the result of your thoughts and feelings so it is important to be aware of them and keep them positive as there is a big chance that it will come to reality. If you don\u2019t keep them posetive you may end up getting something that you did not want by sending the wrong signals to the universe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAngle number 111 is one of the most powerful numbers in numerology since it carries the energies and attributes of both angel number 1 and master number 11. You may be meant to be reading this right now to see how these messages can improve your life and how to decipher what they mean. Let\u2019s look at what your guardian angel wants to tell you with the angel number 111 and the meanings of 111.\n\n## Angel Number 1\n\nNumber 1 is like a sign from ascended masters and angels. It is a number of powerful and creative individuals who can manifest new things through their focus and energy. Number 1 is also associated with independence, ambition, positivity, leadership, new beginnings and striving forward. Seeing angel number 1 is a sign that you are going to manifest something important in your life.\n\n## Master Number 11\n\nThe number 11 is a master number that means it resonates at an extremely\u00a0high vibration. All the attributes of number 1 that we mentioned above, master number 11 multiplies those attributes to a higher power. Number 11 represents a transformation of personal power to a more spiritual and higher level. This number also resonates with spiritual illumination, it reveals that we have great powers of intuition through which we can connect to others and provide a great service to them.\n\n## Number 111\n\nNumber 111 is the combination of number 1 and master number 11 so you can tell that 111 is even more powerful. Through 111, angels are sending the message that your thoughts are becoming real regardless of whether it is bad or good. This is the time to be aware of your persistent thoughts and not thinking negatively or being afraid as your thoughts are manifesting into reality.\n\nWhen seeing 111 repeatedly you need to monitor your thoughts carefully and choose your thoughts wisely by focusing on what you really want rather than what you don\u2019t want and don\u2019t focus on your fears, as they may manifest regardless. The more positive your thoughts are the more energies of abundance get drawn into your life.\n\nAngel number 111 also resonates with inspiration, seeing this number encourages you to inspire and assist others through your natural abilities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRead the complete article on: [I keep seeing 111!! why??](https://unseenzone.com/111-angel-number-meaning-seeing-111/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 63332, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I KEEP SEEING 111, WHAT IS THE MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE OF ANGEL NUMBER 111?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572141213, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dk1fff/i_keep_seeing_111_what_is_the_meaning_and/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mobco", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_o07fw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571474018, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dk0zrg/what_do_you_think_of_aleister_crowley/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dk0zrg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dk0zrg/what_do_you_think_of_aleister_crowley/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571474019, "score": 0, "selftext": "He seemed to have learned some genuine spiritual knowledge along the way but nonetheless lost himself to the forms of the magics he was involved in and not of the essence.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 63327, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What do you think of Aleister Crowley?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572141011, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dk0zrg/what_do_you_think_of_aleister_crowley/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "usernamealrdytakn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kaud2l2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571472513, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dk0t4t/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1863/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dk0t4t", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Enlightenment"}], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dk0t4t/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1863/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "B9EgjVx3Ht5qqXlHF2k6qxNIM4z7GvMkHlBNOSml-hY", "resolutions": [{"height": 72, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/nqUg5SYA4Bj57bhuBRl8z37yXwAl-5aqjVIUz4eRo1w.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=438b7b7af825aa783dba83af45369f9b97de9b8b", "width": 108}, {"height": 144, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/nqUg5SYA4Bj57bhuBRl8z37yXwAl-5aqjVIUz4eRo1w.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b0ed2ada735fa8e40d8eca856ec89c425eda98d", "width": 216}, {"height": 213, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/nqUg5SYA4Bj57bhuBRl8z37yXwAl-5aqjVIUz4eRo1w.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d918209af44a8f7124251a2c2a05f98fcef3d22", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 400, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/nqUg5SYA4Bj57bhuBRl8z37yXwAl-5aqjVIUz4eRo1w.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=ed0ec4a0fc24ef54a28fccd0c35170245c9d6913", "width": 600}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1571472515, "score": 4, "selftext": "**SYNONYMS**\n\niti\u2014thus;

One who is in the brahma-bh\u016bta condition is joyful; he never laments, nor does he desire anything. That is due to confidential knowledge. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also discloses knowledge of the Supersoul. This is also Brahman knowledge, knowledge of Brahman, but it is superior.\n\nHere Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a telIs Arjuna that he can do as he chooses. God does not interfere with the little independence of the living entity. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord has explained in all respects how one can elevate his living condition. The best advice imparted to Arjuna is to surrender unto the Supersoul seated within his heart. By right discrimination, one should agree to act according to the order of the Supersoul. That will help one become situated constantly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of human life. Arjuna is being directly ordered by the Personality of Godhead to fight. Surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in the best interest of the living entities.

Around March/April I think I may have reclosed my heart chakra by holding in some stuff and being less empathetic, which continued through the Summer as I felt myself begin to care less and less about resolving things because (this may be apart of the opening idk) it seemed like smaller emotional annoyances were getting increasingly meaningless so I didn\u2019t even bother. Flash forward to now and I\u2019m starting to feel things affect me on a greater level than before, I feel the warmth/uncomfortableness at higher levels, and I feel my emotional baggage pretty heavily (I can sense my throat chakra and heart chakra being blocked). This may seem very strange, but I want to start resolving some of the stuff on my heart again, but there\u2019s something I\u2019m worried about. Am I going to have to restart my heart chakra opening process from the beginning and have to go through those months of uncomfortableness/pain if I pick up where I left off in my healing journey?

spot parts of peoples energy system that are functioning and working\n\nThey spot someone and obtain their ebergy by pulling it away storing it in on of their bodies\n\nOne guy spots one guy pulls and one guy holds the energy from the victim\n\nThey walk in groups of three men around towns finding the fittest body parts\n\nThey do this in order to mechanically appropriate the energy in to a chain of men ending in the frontline soldier in a warzone somewhere far away\n\nI was victim to this\n\nThey walked past me and one said grab hos legs and gesturally they pulled on my legs \n\nLuckily I am contractually protected agains such activity and psychically mentaly strengthened against psychich attack plus I carry protection crystals\n\nThey will find arms and legs and hands to replace the broken energy system of their soldier bots\n\nThey purposefully extract the original energy from soldiers by hardening them and poisoning their immune and nervous systems with vaccines and energy weapons and drilling\n\nThe men who serve as soldiers are no longer alive\n\nSoldiers are completely soulless husks with cybernetic implants hooked up to a digital serve\n\nThey feel no pain or pleasure and only serve as shells for the collected energy of civilians and prisoners and animals\n\nThey are brain dead robotically operated corpses trained to muscle memory and digital commands from sattelites and antenae\n\nThey will even use social engineering to train civilians as soldiers without the victim knowing\n\nUsing trained operatives and technology to drill processes in to the fabric of your body and then methodically extract the trauma using psyops and digital recording devices\n\nThey use your memory of playing video games to create an ai simulation for their automota\n\nThey require fresh sacrifices at an increasing rate as the soldiers begin to shut down and die\n\nThe lack of empathy is making the programes degenerate in quality over time and also they need fresh recruits to make meat robots but are finding less suitable candidates because their incessant torture system has made men weaker than women\n\nNow they ship in tonnes of imigrants for the same purpose yet they find no appropriate genetic data to fund the databanks of their evil satanic army\n\nThe whole thing takes orders from Saturn or the giant geopathic earth node system connected to the Moon and Saturn\n\nThey are even bringing more souls in to the Earth matrix to create more war and dividing the races inbetween countries to stoke hate and emotional trauma\n\nThey love to extract from virgin children particularly white males for the highest empathy and intelligence\n\nUnfortunately the robots are rellying more on mechanical means and so the army is getting stupider and more bloated as the intelligence system fails to obtain adequate data\n\nThis is happening now by the day\n\nThey are very desperate and have resorted to creating the 5g network\n\n5g is pushed militaristically by gunpoint no one wants it but the military generals they have openly threatened the civilians constantly\n\nThey want to use 5g to extract adrenally fuelled field data from children about the origins of memory and playful activity so they can try and make their robots more creative\n\nThe ai system takes apart the empathy driven protocols and makes them useless every time\n\nThe ai is taking apart the men of the army as well assimilating their bodies in to itself\n\nSoon the nwo military complex will collapse and all cities will with it", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false,

This was following an intense experience of bliss and sort of separation from my body, an understanding that a part of me is connected with the rest of nature.\n\nI was very self centred around this process and mostly made it about my father, who I had not resolved past issues with - he had changed his name to \u201cBC\u201d and started wearing John Lennon glasses since I had began playing in a band. Convinced he was going to \u201cmanage\u201d me.\n\nIn recent years he has started driving interstate at 150 - 200 km/h everywhere he went, and began riding his bike halfway across the state, riding his bike all around town from the moment he woke up, and basically never stopped moving as if he was running from something.\n\nThis friend stopped channeling my mum. Or rather, her attitude had changed towards me, and so had his. I don\u2019t really understand. It\u2019s not some occult thing. It\u2019s to do with Spirit and the present moment and \u201coneness\u201d which I don\u2019t fully understand yet.\n\nThe day it stopped, I frantically called my friend saying that I saw my father hanging in his shed. I went to see my dad the next day, he was alive, and was projecting my mum back to me unconsciously. His fly was undone and he took his belt off.\n\nI was frantically trying to figure out what went wrong from this point. And I started having visions of me drowning in a lake with him and becoming some sort of sex slave, which was very full-on.\n\nI didn\u2019t see him for a couple months and the pain/movements in my head started to dull down. Then my dad had a bike accident.\n\nHis entire head was fractured in the exact shape that my movements were occurring in.\n\nMy friend said to me he has no sympathy for me. That at some point I asked to be \u201cextra normal\u201d and this is what I get. He said I do not understand the severity of it and it\u2019s all going to unravel for me.\n\nMy dad is now calling me my mother. He believes I am John Lennon, and my mother simultaneously. In hospital, he tells all the nurses \u201cI love my son.\u201d Over and over again.\n\nHe\u2019s started saying things like \u201cYou need to tell my son that he is interested in his mother in the Beatles.\u201d And when we talk he says things like \u201cIt\u2019s to do with my father, and your father, and your mother and your sister.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to go from here. My intuition tells me that the next step is for me to smoke weed at my friends house. The last time I did it I saw myself in the cold shower with him. My friend said the image he got was when my dad got behind a dying kangaroo he brought into his house and started bouncing it up and down to keep it alive. I don\u2019t know if I need to keep going deeper into these horrific visions and the fracture I feel in order to stop something from happening.\n\nFor a long time I felt half separate from my body. Turns out, it\u2019s this fracture. Like an event that was always waiting for me and I was experiencing it before it happened.

of THOTH, the Atlantean.\u00a0\n\nFreely I give to thee of my wisdom,\ngathered from the time and space of this cycle;\u00a0\nmaster of mysteries, SUN of the morning,\u00a0\nliving forever, a child of the LIGHT,\u00a0\nshining with brightness, star of the morning,\u00a0\n\nTHOTH the teacher of men, is of ALL.\nLong time ago, I in my childhood,\u00a0\nlay 'neath the stars on long-buried ATLANTIS,\u00a0\ndreaming of mysteries far above men.\u00a0\n\nThen in my heart grew there a great longing to\u00a0\nconquer the pathway that led to the stars.\u00a0\nYear after year, I sought after wisdom,\u00a0\nseeking new knowledge, following the way,\u00a0\nuntil at last my SOUL, in great travail,\u00a0\nbroke from its bondage and bounded away.\n\nFree was I from the bondage of earth-men.\u00a0\nFree from the body, I flashed through the night.\nUnlocked at last for me was the star-space.\u00a0\nFree was I from the bondage of night.\u00a0\nNow to the end of space sought I wisdom,\u00a0\nfar beyond knowledge of finite man.\n\nFar into space, my SOUL traveled freely\u00a0\ninto infinity's circle of light.\nStrange, beyond knowledge, were some of the planets,\u00a0\ngreat and gigantic, beyond dreams of men.\u00a0\n\nYet found I Law, in all of its beauty, working\u00a0\nthrough and among them as here among men.\u00a0\n\nFlashed forth my soul through infinity's beauty,\u00a0\nfar through space\u00a0\nI flew with my thoughts.\n\nRested I there on a planet of beauty.\u00a0\nStrains of harmony filled all the air.\u00a0\n\nShapes there were, moving in Order,\u00a0\ngreat and majestic as stars in the night;\u00a0\nmounting in harmony, ordered equilibrium,\u00a0\nsymbols of the Cosmic, like unto Law.\n\nMany the stars I passed in my journey,\u00a0\nmany the races of men on their worlds;\u00a0\nsome reaching high as stars of the morning,\u00a0\nsome falling low in the blackness of night.\n\nEach and all of them struggling upward,\u00a0\ngaining the heights and plumbing the depths,\u00a0\nmoving at times in realms of brightness,\nliving through darkness, gaining the Light.\n\nKnow, O man, that Light is thine heritage.\nKnow that darkness is only a veil.\u00a0\nSealed in thine heart is brightness eternal,\u00a0\nwaiting the moment of freedom to conquer,\u00a0\nwaiting to rend the veil of the night.\n\nSome I found who had conquered the ether.\u00a0\nFree of space were they while yet they were men.\nUsing the force that is the foundation of ALL things,\u00a0\nfar in space constructed they a planet,\u00a0\ndrawn by the force that flows through the ALL;\u00a0\ncondensing, coalescing the ether into forms,\nthat grew as they willed.\u00a0\n\nOutstripping in science, they, all of the races,\u00a0\nmighty in wisdom, sons of the stars.\nLong time I paused, watching their wisdom.\u00a0\nSaw them create from out of the ether cities\u00a0\ngigantic of rose and gold.\u00a0\nFormed forth from the primal element,\nbase of all matter, the ether far flung.\n\nFar in the past, they had conquered the ether,\u00a0\nfreed themselves from the bondage of toil;\u00a0\nformed in their mind only a picture and swiftly\u00a0\ncreated, it grew.\n\nForth then, my soul sped, throughout the Cosmos,\u00a0\nseeing ever, new things and old;\u00a0\nlearning that man is truly space-born,\u00a0\na Sun of the Sun,\u00a0\na child of the stars.\n\nKnow ye, O man, whatever from ye inhabit,\nsurely it is one with the stars.\n\nThy bodies are nothing but planets revolving\naround their central suns.\u00a0\n\nWhen ye have gained the light of all wisdom,\u00a0\nfree shall ye be to shine in the ether --\u00a0\none of the Suns that light outer darkness --\u00a0\none of the space-born grown into Light.\u00a0\n\nJust as the stars in time lose their brilliance,\u00a0\nlight passing from them in to the great source,\u00a0\nso, O man, the soul passes onward,\u00a0\nleaving behind the darkness of night.\n\nFormed forth ye, from the primal ether,\u00a0\nfilled with the brilliance that\u00a0\nflows from the source,\u00a0\nbound by the ether coalesced around,\u00a0\nyet ever it flames until at last it is free.\n\nLift up your flame from out of the darkness,\u00a0\nfly from the night and ye shall be free.\n\nTraveled I through the space-time,\u00a0\nknowing my soul at last was set free,\nknowing that now might I pursue wisdom.\u00a0\nUntil at last, I passed to a plane,\u00a0\nhidden from knowledge,\u00a0\nknown not to wisdom,\u00a0\nextension beyond all that we know.\u00a0\n\nNow, O man, when I had this knowing,\u00a0\nhappy my soul grew,\nfor now I was free.\u00a0\nListen, ye space-born,\u00a0\nlist to my wisdom:\nknow ye not that ye, too, will be free.\n\nList ye again, O man, to my wisdom,\u00a0\nthat hearing, ye too, might live and be free.\nNot of the earth are ye -- earthy,\u00a0\nbut child of the Infinite Cosmic Light.\n\nKnow ye not, O man, of your heritage?\nKnow ye not ye are truly the Light?\nSun of the Great Sun, when ye gain wisdom,\u00a0\ntruly aware of your kinship with Light.\n\nNow, to ye, I give knowledge,\u00a0\nfreedom to walk in the path I have trod,\nshowing ye truly how by my striving,\u00a0\nI trod the path that leads to the stars.\n\nHark ye, O man, and know of thy bondage,\u00a0\nknow how to free thyself from the toils.\u00a0\nOut of the darkness shall ye rise upward,\u00a0\none with the Light and one with the stars.\n\nFollow ye ever the path of wisdom.\u00a0\nOnly by this can ye rise from below.\u00a0\nEver man's destiny leads him onward\ninto the Curves of Infinity's ALL.\n\nKnow ye, O man, that all space is ordered.\u00a0\nOnly by Order are ye One with the ALL.\u00a0\nOrder and Balance are the Law of the Cosmos.\u00a0\nFollow and ye shall be One with the ALL.\n\nHe who would follow the pathway of wisdom,\u00a0\nopen must be he to the flower of life,\u00a0\nextending his consciousness out of the darkness,\u00a0\nflowing through time and space in the ALL.\n\nDeep in the silence,\u00a0\nfirst ye must linger until at last ye\u00a0\nare free from desire,\u00a0\nfree from the longing to speak in the silence.\u00a0\n\nConquer by silence, the bondage of words.\u00a0\nAbstaining from eating until we have conquered\u00a0\ndesire for food, that is bondage of soul.\n\nThen lie ye down in the darkness.\u00a0\nClose ye your eyes from the rays of the Light.\nCentre thy soul-force in the place of thine consciousness,\u00a0\nshaking it free from the bonds of the night.\u00a0\n\nPlace in thy mind-place the image thou desireth.\u00a0\nPicture the place thou desireth to see.\u00a0\nVibrate back and forth with thy power.\u00a0\nLoosen the soul from out of its night.\nFiercely must thou shake with all of thy power\u00a0\nuntil at last thy soul shall be free.\n\nMighty beyond words is the flame of the Cosmic,\nhanging in planes, unknown to man;\nmighty and balanced, moving in Order,\u00a0\nmusic of harmonies, far beyond man.\u00a0\n\nSpeaking with music, singing with color,\u00a0\nflame from the beginning of Eternity's ALL.\nSpark of the flame art thou, O my children,\u00a0\nburning with color and living with music.\u00a0\nList to the voice and thou shalt be free.\n\nConsciousness free is fused with the Cosmic,\u00a0\nOne with the Order and Law of the ALL.\nKnew ye not man, that out of the darkness,\u00a0\nLight shall flame forth, a symbol of ALL.\n\nPray ye this prayer for attaining of wisdom.\u00a0\nPray for the coming of Light to the ALL.\n\nMighty SPIRIT of LIGHT that shines through the\u00a0\nCosmos, draw my flame closer in harmony to thee.\u00a0\nLift up my fire from out of the darkness,\u00a0\nmagnet of fire that is One with the ALL.\u00a0\nLift up my soul, thou mighty and potent.\u00a0\nChild of the Light, turn not away.\u00a0\nDraw me in power to melt in thy furnace;\u00a0\nOne with all things and all things\u00a0\nin

of the material energy.**\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nArjuna was not the supreme knower, and his decision to fight or not to fight was confined to his limited discretion. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instructed that the individual is not all in all. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, or He Himself, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the localized Supersoul, sits in the heart directing the living being. After changing bodies, the living entity forgets his past deeds, but the Supersoul, as the knower of the past, present and future, remains the witness of all his activities. Therefore all the activities of living entities are directed by this Supersoul. The living entity gets what he deserves and is carried by the material body which is created in the material energy under the direction of the Supersoul. As soon as a living entity is placed in a particular type of body, he has to work under the spell of that bodily situation. A person seated in a high-speed motor car goes faster than one seated in a slower car, though the living entities, the drivers, may be the same. Similarly, by the order of the Supreme Soul, material nature fashions a particular type of body to a particular type of living entity to work according to his past desires. The living entity is not independant. One should not think himself independant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The individual is always under His control. Therefore his duty is to surrender, and that is the injunction of the next verse.\n\n**Question 1 : How after changing bodies or after death, the activities of a living entity start again ? Why it is the duty of a living entity to surrender unto the Lord ?**\n\n[Picture : Bhagavad gita 18.61](https://gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/61)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 63003, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 18.61", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572109959, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dj4qbm/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1861/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mazuzu212", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_15a304gg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571303302, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dj3q6o/the_spiritual_practice_of_selfcompassion_can_be/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dj3q6o", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dj3q6o/the_spiritual_practice_of_selfcompassion_can_be/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "g6lW05eDFPTuk_IdkvaZ5T63uC8mChXD-SG7w_WINgQ", "resolutions": [{"height": 58, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JAw25xyuYuTqov6ELsbsQchUzzRExFzaeOnNO_lxA7E.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd5cb495de428990bab9d7626eb60a20e5c4072d", "width": 108}, {"height": 116, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JAw25xyuYuTqov6ELsbsQchUzzRExFzaeOnNO_lxA7E.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5cd08a68fb37d3690332e0e7763af61a93b0a57", "width": 216}, {"height": 172, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JAw25xyuYuTqov6ELsbsQchUzzRExFzaeOnNO_lxA7E.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=706624cad7fe81cffa9c1a6a48c36a1322a0dc92", "width": 320}, {"height": 344, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JAw25xyuYuTqov6ELsbsQchUzzRExFzaeOnNO_lxA7E.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9be701368713b810d7752e33bf0ee7d426726d26", "width": 640}, {"height": 516, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JAw25xyuYuTqov6ELsbsQchUzzRExFzaeOnNO_lxA7E.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dbd4af395fdd27931dc4bd2205865c566a9df96", "width": 960}, {"height": 581, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JAw25xyuYuTqov6ELsbsQchUzzRExFzaeOnNO_lxA7E.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=503bac8be4b8d0d9bc662ac132c89bfc3089b10b", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 689, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/JAw25xyuYuTqov6ELsbsQchUzzRExFzaeOnNO_lxA7E.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=9dc6999a70e4e62ebf7b4258b66815d7fa51bf21", "width": 1280}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1571303306, "score": 64, "selftext": " Kristin Neff called Compassion Our common humanity.

You are likely not to be crucified, burned at the stake, beheaded, drawn and quartered, stoned, drowned, hanged, or eaten by tribals or angry celestial beings, which stopped happening here at least only a mere century ago in the US.  I don't think anyone's been lynched or torched in the last century, not telling out there in the wood.  Why can't people keep their superstition civil?  Between the threats it's one demographic or another insulting the other or bereaving us with their needs or exclamations their not worshipping whichever ethnic god.  These shit postings weren't for my ego, I am trying to humor myself and us all.  \n\n  It's not normal to go off the minds eye, or minds vision.  I'm not delusional to the point where my imagination is something I believe is something I should express as alternative history and facts.  I try to find some basis in the things I see and do believe in ration and logic, once again. I'm not trying to hard to compensate for my sanity these days.  It just becomes more and more aggravating when there's something I want to talk about and people do not want me to.  I can understand and abide it's just aggravating, beats being murdered or detained or put away or something.  The looney bin's is sucky and I don't think they have xbox.\n\nI'm otherwise just a regular 33 year old, I enjoy regular recreational activities, exercise, gaming and do not have any delusions about being a deity.  That gag just became a slippery slope into assassination I'm not interested in.  I'm really immature and otherwise a Heathen, I guess.  I did not believe in these dogma's or piety, personally.  I would leave people to their devices and to worship what they want, Earth, Mammon or Aliens.  I'm not one for bureaucracy really, I've got a lot of growing up to do.  I have a young soul and would prefer the remedial labors of an enlisted soldier, a corporeal or something.  I'm not delusional or superstitious and enjoy danger and need no persuasions of a glory or damnation in the afterlife. I'll be ready for bureaucracy in another couple of decades.  \n\nThey keep'em young in these military organizations lately. You have until your 35 to get into some fields, honors I was interested in, doing it all.  I'm 33 and can't get back in do to absolute horse shit.  Able, willing, hungry, sign the god damn papers.  It shouldn't be so difficult to get an able and willing and hungry recruit back on duty.\n\nI do not think I have super powers yet have had gone on to talk about ESP.  Then I decided it's easier not to talk about ESP because those are super powers.  We're learning more about theories that the pineal gland may have something to do with extra sensory and aural awareness, but, it's not established at this time or whether or not the Governments withholding disclosure of the awareness of ESP's or Aliens.\n\nSo until the FEDs release some documents I'm good on the conspiracy theories or sharing my experiences with ESP's because I don't want to go to the asylum.  The Asylum is sucky the most and I think things would be bad there without xbox.  However, if they have xbox I would have to way the pro's and con's of throwing in the towel and having a stay there.\n\nOther than that I am failing to find much humor in religion or the atrocities that have transpired over the millenia over superstition, dogma or piety.  I guess it's funny when all this bloodshed transpired over superstition and people can laugh about it.  I just find my conscience and humanity after a few short minutes and am amazed at the capacity for cruelty so many powerful people had in this world.  What turns a Man against humanity to the extent where they are able to kill their fellow Man by the thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions to multiple millions?  Bringing about wars in which tens of millions die?\n\nWell you don't have to worry about that if I ever am reinstated as a bureaucrat or deity.  We will worry less about human recycling and getting you guys jobs, unions, there will be work for you in the new Kingdom.  I'm not going to paraphrase Adolf Hitler, like I was, but, people said that's not funny either.  But, we would focus on Humanitarian and Environmental efforts.  So just keep doing that and working on breakthroughs for these diseases and viruses killing everybody.  \n\nI had already been berated for talking about Nazi Propaganda, I was trying to tell people I wasn't making it up.  That \"Horse Shit\" blew my mind...  I mean, I wasn't making it up, I didn't even know about it.  These kids were talking about it I was just sharing it, didn't mean to stir up any Gus coming out of the shadows..  I kind of offended some folks, yikes.  But, I'm not a Nazi, so fuck them if they're Nazi.  \n\nWe must remain vigilant to these organizations that are loyal to the 3rd Reich.  I swore an Oath to uphold and defend Democracy and even believe in Democracy.  I think that's a good note to leave off on.  Remember why we have Democracy and no blasphemy laws.  Why forgiveness prevails and that it's never to late to apologize for eternally offending someone, time heals all.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTime heals all.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 62918, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Remember Big Brother", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572102767, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dix1lo/remember_big_brother/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "vegetadeion", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_mf9aw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571264729, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/diwxs5/can_family_block_your_blessings/", "gildings": {}, "id": "diwxs5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/diwxs5/can_family_block_your_blessings/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571264733, "score": 7, "selftext": "Can your family block your blessings and things that will better your life?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 62918, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can family block your blessings?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572102715, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/diwxs5/can_family_block_your_blessings/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "startup_stuff", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4rbdux3p", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571264496, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/diwvr9/developing_a_mental_health_meets_shopping_mobile/", "gildings": {}, "id": "diwvr9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/diwvr9/developing_a_mental_health_meets_shopping_mobile/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "Sorct-p_6GU7fDLF7spXPDJwkErqSyPzkSXHXQhJR0c", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99e342e53c1da6ad64e5191890a68011aa208652", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b01d1c9285c306afb96be09b8add7ce737ab64a", "width": 216}, {"height": 167, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93fc923dc20d601ecfe9365d8b4c99b488ee2a11", "width": 320}, {"height": 334, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1eb5233ee7c70f54b32940bae05103111db84520", "width": 640}, {"height": 502, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2af7a9b1b78500e8b5e63df4727c565eaa3cf4c8", "width": 960}, {"height": 565, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fd9999061823901076cf5a93d8eda1adc6fc2bf", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 628, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/CKhQt1-udU5MrYpZBt-WGkd-HhhFTIP3_F0pBPyx3kk.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f6f55b828d7b119a03162c74b4f7e141744b9abf", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1571264497, "score": 2, "selftext": "I\u2019m developing a mobile app and am conducting a survey of people interested in mindfulness, yoga, journaling, meditation, mental health, and related areas.

At the time I was in a relationship so it wasn't even anything flirty all of us exchanged snapchats and that was that. We would snap on and off, occasionally text or run into each other at a concert. Well one day there was going to be a music festival and we decided a group of us would go together. So we hung out and we clicked like strangely well, there was just an energy that drew us in. So a week after that I really wanted to take a spontaneous road trip and my (now ex) wouldn't go with me, he was totally fine w/ other guy going - as intrigued as I was by him I didn't think there would be anything romantic - I wasn't even really attracted to him. Fast forward to said road trip and as soon as we got in the car we couldn't stop talking, we stayed up for over 24 hours straight just talking and bonding and it was like that the whole time. After that we just couldn't stay away from each other (old relationship ended) and me and my potential TF/Soulmate started seeing insane synchronizations EVERYWHERE. We were even talking about fox and deer on a drive one night (I've never seen a wild fox) and we saw a pair of deer and a pair of fox one after another. We are now together and we don't necessarily fight a lot, but we do push eachothers buttons hard but it's not even intentional. It's like he's the old version of myself and does things that I used to absolutely hate about myself and vice versa, but we quickly move past the tears and genuinely love each other. I've been in a toxic relationship, it's not toxic, just overly emotional and fire-charged. But when things are great, they're so great. He has made me more spiritual, we meditate together, spend time in nature, do tarot, he truly makes me feel whole. We truly click unlike anyone I've ever met.

I\u2019m not sure if this is the right community to post into but if not hopefully I can be directed to where this type of post goes. This is my first time posting and I\u2019m on mobile if there are any misspellings/errors. \n\nI\u2019m hoping someone can help explain this connection I have with a person or give me a similar experience so I can feel more validated in my current experience. This may be a long story so I apologize in advanced!\n\nI met a guy (a Libra, I\u2019m an Aries) 2 weeks ago while out drinking downtown. I was out with friends and he was out with his friends. We have no overlapping friends or connections. His best friend ended up coming up to me and striking up conversation and our groups merged. I was initially attracted to Mr. Libra but didn\u2019t fully want to engage but after more drinks I ended up giving him my number and we hung out later that night. \n\nI was leaving the town the next day and while I was gone we hadn\u2019t really talked (assuming this was a 1 night thing). I have an oddly good memory and remembered his birthday and I texted him - we ended up talking and basically haven\u2019t stopped since. We linked up when I got back in town and we ended up talking about spirituality, astral projecting, heaven &amp; hell, demons and spirits, all of this stuff that I really have never talked to anyone about. \n\nThe next day after I saw him we were texting about all of the same topics and it was like he flicked on a light switch and everything seemed to make so much sense (almost like he helped guide me to the next level of energy frequency). I started to literally freak out because I\u2019ve never had this type of interaction before and he confirms he feels the exact same way. That he feels like I\u2019m supposed to help him spiritually get to the next level and vice versa. \n\nWe both confirmed we have the same feeling like we were most definitely supposed to meet that night (he wasn\u2019t even supposed to go out and for me it was supposed to be a girls night with no intention of meeting guys). I have extremely good intuition and I can quite literally feel it in my bones that he is supposed to play some type of role in my life (however big or small that role might be). We also agreed we definitely know there\u2019s a connection but we\u2019re not sure if it lies in the romantic side of connection (mind you we\u2019ve only seen each other/hooked up twice over the 2 weeks that we\u2019ve known each other so it may be too early to tell). So what started out as a sexual/attraction based interaction we\u2019ve now morphed into this spiritual growth based interaction. Where it feels as if I\u2019m supposed to guide him to be more I tuned spiritually and he\u2019s supposed to help me stay on course and be more grounded. (I read tarot and pulled cards to understand who Mr. Libra is to me, I can share the picture of the spread if anyone is interested and maybe that can help provide clarity too). \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to figure out is, has anyone else had an undeniable spiritual connection with someone they don\u2019t know that well, and is this like a kindred spirits/twin flame/past life connection as well? \n\nReally just looking for confirmation that I\u2019m not totally out of my mind.

Pain has accompanied me throughout my life. I say \"accompanied\" because I've carried it with me, both consciously and subconsciously. This past month has been most profoundly painful, specifically this past weekend. Boy, I was hurting deeply. I felt overcome with loneliness, powerlessness, and that nothing could distract me. I didn't have a fight in me; I hopelessly wallowed in my sorrows and succumbed to my misery. Felt fucking awful. But in doing so, I finally yielded. I let pain overcome me fully. It was powerful, metaphysical really, like mfing God was asking \"are you going to finally commit to yourself or do I need to cause you further pain?!?\" And then, in the thick of an overwhelming, drawn out meltdown, I had an insight: I falsely asserted that my sadness was passing, which was a disingenuous assumption to rid myself of a preeminent \"life has forsaken me\" mentality. Better yet, I AM disingenuous (with myself, principally, but I consequently reflect that back onto others). \nI'd been doing plenty of introspection prior to this. It wasn't until I was once again at my wits' end, however, that I realized none of this is being productively worked through because it's all tied to my ego. And the ego is simply affected by external forces no matter how humbling an experience was.  In touting my supposed self-betterment and newfound awareness, I was STILL perpetuating this egocentric cycle: I turned acute introspection into a matter of pride by wearing it like a badge. And this is why, throughout my entire life, I've found myself going down the same path in pursuit of a 'glimmer of hope,' rather than taking the time to work through everything for my own sake. I'm the only person who can save myself, and it's time I acknowledge that happiness and love must first come from within if I want to share them with anyone else (and not fall codependent). To do so, I need to harmonize my ego and consciousness, find \"completion\" in my only constant: myself.  Everything happens for a reason. I'm far too small to shift the tide of an ocean, but for most of my life, I've paddled futily and foolishly anyway, hoping sheer fight will change the facts of life. A relentless crusader for fleeting hopes, really.  Moving on from this tired mentality is the start of the new me, where I CAN heal from CPTSD, purge my demons, and reclaim my self-worth. It's time I put faith in myself and discover my sense of self/identity. I now believe that life isn't about hope and aspirations, it's about achieving contentment through acceptance, understanding that much of life is greater than all of us. It's all about your mentality -- this isn't rock bottom, it's my spiritual awakenening and rebirth. I may be lost now, but I'll find my way home.\n\ntl;dr God? Kafka?

However; am I crazy, or does it feel like there are long term effects and symptoms of spiritual awakening and spirituality in general. \n\nLike being emotionally detached and desensitized.

I\u2019m scared not for me, but for the millions of people finding solace in spirituality,\nand being transformed into robots in the long run. \n\nIt\u2019s human to feel, to expect, to hurt. \nBut it almost feels like spiritual teachings can make people lose these facets that make us human. These books/teachings/tweets\ntell us that we are \u201csupposed\u201d to detach from our expectations, thoughts and feelings. \n\nEveryday I see people becoming like (Jaha), \na character from a show called \u2018The 100\u2019.\nThey don\u2019t feel, they barely get upset, because that would mean that their attachments to expectations of outcomes caused it. They don\u2019t get too excited because that would mean they are attached, yet again. Spiritual gurus make it seem as if there is something wrong with being hurt after a break up, or being sad over hurtful words. THAT IS HUMAN! These teachings are just thought reform, and mind controlling methods of being emotionless. If words do not hurt you, or if you don\u2019t get hurt by someone you love leaving you, that doesn\u2019t just make you \u201cspiritually awakened\u201d it also makes you emotionless and detached. I am on my spiritual journey, and there are lessons and practices that I\u2019ve learned along the way to help me attain consciousness, which is magical.

The Aura Has Seven Layers\n\nAlso known as the subtle bodies, there are seven layers of your aura that correspond with [the seven chakras in your body](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sadhguru/the-7-chakras-and-their-s_b_844268.html). They are reflective of your physical, emotional and spiritual health. \n\nAt any given time, your aura emits a mixture of colors and light (it will never be just one colour), and each of these shades says a lot about how you're currently feeling. For example, if there's a brilliant yellow, it probably means you're feeling spiritually alive and energetic, and clouded red can mean you're experiencing feelings of anger, sadness or emotional turmoil.\n\n# 2. Auras Can Be Captured In Photos\n\nThere are certain cameras out there that photograph your aura by pressing your hands onto metal plates that sit on top of electric boxes. Having your aura photographed has almost become a bit of a trend with names like Diane Von Furstenberg and Alexander Wang sharing their aura pictures with *Harpers Bazaar* last year. Not surprisingly, [Gwyneth Paltrow and her Goop staff had their auras captured](http://goop.com/radiant-human-aura-photography/) by a company called [Radiant Human, who travels around the country](https://www.instagram.com/radianthuman_/?hl=en) to snapshot people's auras. \n\nIn 1939, Russian inventor Semyon Davidovich Kirlian invented a method of taking portraits using a metal plate and an electric current that he claimed could reveal the \u201clife force\u201d of his subjects\u2014even predict illnesses. Kirlian photography is regarded as the predecessor to what we now know as aura photography, and there were only 100 of these made.\n\n# 3. Auras Change Colours\n\nIf you're not in a particularly great place in your life, your aura will reflect it. But you know you won't be stuck in this rut forever, which means your aura won't be dull for long. The good news is you don't have to do anything to change your aura after things get better. \n\nJust the natural shift in your emotional and physical health will result in an aural transformation, because [your aura is always alive](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/12/christina-lonsdale_n_6840604.html), and always connected to your body and the universe. There's no off switch, so it keeps up with you at every turn.\n\n# 4. Auras Can Be Cleansed\n\nOnce you become aware of the power of auras, you can consciously do a  few things that will keep your aura nice and clean. A simple way to [keep yourself clear is to merely envision your aura](https://www.gaia.com/article/spiritual-spring-cleaning-6-ways-cleanse-your-bodys-aura) during a seated meditation. Close your eyes, picture a white light radiating from within your body, and then imagine it flowing through your whole system from head to toe. Think of that bright light clearing  out the dullness in your aura and bringing you back to a healthy centeredness.\n\nSessions with an  energetic healer might be the right way to go, but if that doesn't tickle your pickle, you can always get yourself some dried white sage or Palo Santo. Smudging with these is an ancient practice used in many Indigenous cultures to clear out negative energy. Light your sage and wave the smoke around your home, as well as your whole body. You may not feel an instant change, but it will evoke a happy shift in your aura nevertheless.\n\n## THE RADIANT HUMAN TAKE ON COLOUR THEORY\n\n# RED\n\n* Strength, Will Power, New Beginnings, Leadership, Action, Practicality, Passion.\n* Reds are encouraged to get plenty of exercise and get into nature to achieve balance.\n* *Heavy and dark typically indicates low energy.*\n\n# ORANGE\n\n* Creative, Confident, Independent, Collaborative, Excellent People Skills, Loves Challenge.\n* Can be emotionally aloof, so to revive orange energy get into water, or visit a river or ocean.\n* *Orange is usually found in entrepreneurs, successful sales people, or those who work with many people.*\n\n# TAN\n\n* Detail Oriented, Cautious, Logical, Strategic, To-Do Lists, Highly Intelligent.\n* *Tans make great planners and work well with structure.

Not only that, it linked itself to my wireless speaker and started playing this TV show through it, even though he has to manually select my speaker from the BlueTooth list or it won\u2019t play normally when we do watch stuff. \n\nHis laptop has done something similar before a year back, I was sleeping and his laptop, which again was closed and in deep sleep mode, randomly opened YouTube again and started playing the video we had been watching earlier, this woke me up in the middle of the night as it was quite loud.\n\nYesterday I asked \u201cwho ever is there, please can you do the same and play a video through the laptop again when he comes home from work...\u201d just to see what happens...\n\nThen when I was getting ready to go to work, the Nintendo Switch decided to randomly turn itself on, I hadn\u2019t touched it at all, just heard the noise it makes when it comes on, so I had to come back and turn it off lol \n\nAt my old workplace some of the staff were being spooked by something, it started happening the day after a person there had died, the person was very timid and quiet, soft nature etc... but stuff would start happening like, the hoover in the room would turn itself on and off randomly... the door bell started ringing and no one was there, this happened the day after he had died, he would normally ring the doorbell to come in for his dinner, but this time no one was there, it would happen often after that..\n\nOn one occasion, for the first time ever, I saw a washing basket moving by itself on the carpet floor and when I looked to see who was pushing it, no one was around, it gave me a shock.\n\nAnother staff member was startled in the night as the TV in their bedroom turned itself on and was on full blast! They text on the group chat asking if it was a prank because it wasn\u2019t very funny, but no one was around the mess with any remote control.  \n\nStuff like this happens more often these past years for me, like at my old workplace, but just stuff happening with tech around me or my partner.\n\nAnyone have any ideas?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 62835, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Strange things happening with tech again", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572093856, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dinuvu/strange_things_happening_with_tech_again/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "japaneseblue", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_fzfzh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571216696, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dimm45/13_seeking_opinions/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dimm45", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dimm45/13_seeking_opinions/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571216698, "score": 1, "selftext": "The number 13 is everywhere.

I have no plans, no urge, no desire to do it, but I do feel as though I am meant to take my own life. I've had very weird dreams most of my life and I was always told by the adults in my life that I watched too much TV, have to active of an imagination or to just shut up and pray to their god because it made them feel uncomfortable.\n\nAs I think about it, I don't want to say that I've never experienced joy, I've just never been truly satisfied with what I felt. I've tried to hold onto the happiness and spread it to others but all of done in 27 years is cause harm to those I love, sabotage myself in every manner and be stuck, either by my own doings, or now by the government stepping in and preventing me from moving freely. \n\nEvery time I have had a desire or goal set for myself, it gets dangled in front of me on a string by whatever is running this show and then just as soon as I feel it on my fingertips, either the one in control rips it away and kicks me in the fucking face for trying, or, my body goes into autopilot and burns the entire thing to ashes for me while my mind can only sit and watch it happen.\n\nI was in a band when I was younger and, not to sound conceited, but we were good. Really good. Our music drew in large crowds at every show, we had a kick ass album recorded and it was selling. At the last show that we played, I announced that I was quitting, without thinking about it, and completely unprompted. The entire band and their shot disappeared because my body went autopilot and ruined it for all of us.\n\nI've had not one, not two but three wonderful women who were perfect for me in everyway step into my life unannounced and unplanned and each time was through my own fault that it ended. The first was because I was so neglectful that I treated her as a burden and broke it off with her myself. I spent a week in bed crying and not eating because I couldn't believe what I had done to myself and to her.\n\nThe second was was the ideal wife material. She cared about me, supported me, loved me and motivated me to succeed in anything that I put my mind to and i, again, neglected her and her life. Autopilot kicked in and I broke it off with her. It crushed her. After a few weeks we got back together and less than a month in I broke it off and destroyed her again.\n\nThe third was the worst. I feel so much love for this woman and have since the moment that I met her, but the entire 5 years we spent together I was running autopilot. She tried to show me how I was being, she held on so hard, even when I tried to break it off with her, she still held on and gave every bit of herself to stay by my side but I kept getting worse and worse. \n\nShe left me.\n\nI was so devastated that I did commit suicide. I was gone for almost 4 minutes and was revived in the ambulance. I can't explain in words what I saw but I'm going to try. \n\nThere was black all around with a small glimmer of light that was made of so many colors, so that I have never even seen here on earth. I tried to get closer to it when I heard my own voice outside of my head tell me \"you aren't done. You aren't leaving now. I will not let you leave\" and it felt as if my ankles were grabbed and i was jerked back with tremendous force into my body where I opened my eyes to the EMTs hovering over me.\n\nAfter coming back, I see the world... differently. I see every little connection and every little consequence to each of the actions that I take, every sentence I speak and even in the lives of others. I don't feel crazy, but I feel alone and I know that how I was brought me to this point. I'm alone and I feel like I will be for the rest of my life and it's not a life that I want.\n\nI've actually moved away from the town where I lived with my ex fiance to come to a new area where I was offered a very high paying job in order to start over and try again. Well after the 5hour drive with all of my belongings to move here, I interviewed with this employer today(keep in mind that they have been telling me for weeks that the position is mine as soon as I moved) and they informed me that they hired someone else to fill the spot and they will not hire me at all.\n\nI'm now stuck in a home I can't pay rent on, jobless with no one. Again, this isn't a plea for help, but why in the FUCK should I stay here with a brain that thinks the way it does, a soul that has finally been able to take control for nothing, and be without anyone but my thoughts.

Cultivating mindfulness also gives us the capability to go meta on any given situation.    We can perceive things from a higher perspective in a more objective way, rather than through our own conditioned and subjective filters.  We become more aware of our conscious intentions.  Mindfulness allows us to look beyond the surface of things, to go deeper into underlying causes and motivations.\n\nCompassion is a basic trait of all humans, but much of it has  been stripped away due to the conditioning we've received from  birth.  Our society is largely based on greed and competition  over empathy and cooperation.  Anthropocentrism rules the day.    Humans think they are the most important species on the  planet and that Earth is just here for us to use in any way we  see fit. \n\nJust because someone has realized the oneness of everything,  and has experienced the insight of no-self, does not mean that  they are not unconscious in other aspects of their life.   The best example of this behavior is the support many spiritual people give to industries that commit terrible atrocities against innocent animals. \n\nLet's say someone who considers themselves spiritual and perhaps even an animal lover, goes to the store to buy bacon.    In the act of buying bacon, can they be both mindful and compassionate at the same time?\n\nTo be mindful, one has to be aware of where that bacon came from.  The bacon that is being sold in grocery stores most  likely comes from pigs that have spent their entire lives in small cages, suffering terribly under the most horrific  conditions imaginable.  Many pigs live their lives in cages where they are unable to even turn around, and are forced to  live in misery day after day until they are finally slaughtered.   They are forcibly impregnated and their babies are immediately taken from them after birth.   Even if you buy  \"free-range\" meat it only means the animal was let outside for  a very limited time period.  They still spend most of their lives suffering under terrible conditions.  It's worth noting that pigs are very sensitive beings and are more intelligent than dogs.\n\nLet's say you have a next door neighbor who keeps his dog in his backyard in a small cage where he's confined 24/7.  You  hear the dog crying and whimpering for hours on end, week after week.  Then one day the dog isn't there.   You ask your  neighbor what happened to his dog, and he replies that he killed the him to consume his flesh.   And then he asks if  you'd like to buy some of his dog meat.   How would you react?\n\nNow imagine that a large corporation is doing this on a massive scale.  Making a huge profit from selling meat from  millions of dogs that have been kept in small cages under horrific conditions their entire lives.   Would you be inclined to support this company with your hard earned cash?\n\nWell this is happening every time you buy meat from the  grocery store.  No, it's not dog meat, but it's meat from  another sentient being who may be even more aware and  sensitive to suffering than a dog is.   Either way, why subject an innocent animal to this kind of suffering?\n\nBeing aware of how our actions affect other beings, not just  humans but all sentient beings, is required for mindfulness.\n\nTo be compassionate, one must never deliberately cause harm to another being, except in self-defense or another life- threatening situation (like starvation).   There is little difference between hurting an animal yourself and paying a  corporation to do it for you, except that they are going to have less empathy for the animal than if you did it yourself.   Just as if you paid a hitman to kill someone for you, it's  just as bad as if you killed the person yourself.\n\nIf the person buying the bacon knows the terrible conditions the pig endured but decided to go ahead and buy it anyway,  they may be mindful but are certainly not compassionate.   If  they would never hurt an animal themselves, but still bought  the bacon, then a they're likely not mindful of the conditions  that the animal had to endure.  \n\nTo be mindful, we must have the awareness to educate ourselves about the consequences of our actions and the kind of things we want to support.   Compassion and mindfulness work  synergistically to raise our level of conscious awareness.    Having one without the other is not going to bring about a  better world for anyone.\n\nIf you're a meat-eater, the next time you go to the store to  buy meat, please be mindful of the intensity of suffering and  misery that the animal had to go through, in order for that  package to be sitting there for you to buy.   If you're mindful and are truly compassionate, then you will choose a vegan alternative.\n\nI know there are meat eaters out there who will say that all life consumes other life, and that it's just the natural cycle  of life and death that we kill animals and eat them.  I'm not  referring to people living sustainably off the land.  There is  nothing natural about factory farming, where 99% of all meat sold in grocery stores comes from.   The dairy and egg  industries cause even more suffering to animals, because their lives are prolonged to extract additional resources from them.   This is nothing like hunting in the wild for dinner where the  animals live their lives free, and then die a relatively quick death.  There is nothing natural about buying meat from a  grocery store in a nice plastic package.\n\nIf you buy any animal products from the store, it's almost  certain that an innocent animal had to suffer terribly for  that product to be sitting there.   To be both mindful and compassionate humans, we must go vegan.   For every dish you  want to make, there are always delicious vegan alternatives.

Therefore, no one does anything \"wrong\" and nothing is actually an accident. \n\nFailures are only perceived that way because the orginally set goal appears to have been missed, but the truth seems to say that they are only a part of the journey to the true goal of getting what one wants. It's why perserverence in the face of \"failure\" is important. It seems like failures truly are opportunies perfectly presented to us to gain understanding on the path to whatever goal we're flowing to. \n\nSo piety is a material and thoughts/speech/actions are the tools that work with the material to create a structure within the mind. Or piety is a seed, and thoughts/speech/actions are focused sunlight, food and water for seeds of the mind. One can starve piety by not serving it. However, if one at any time allows oneself to have any moment of feeling \"better/smarter/kinder/stronger/etc...\" in whatever way over someone else (even a prior version of self), one opens the door for the dual opposite feeling of shame when stepping outside of the behavior deemed \"better\". \n\nOne limits oneself in this way and closes the possibility that whatever is done by anyone in any moment is perfect for them on their path. It is a way of subverting onself subconsciously but building the structure fully consciously. Piety produces it's equal opposite and chains one to a rule-like set of behavior as \"-er\" judgments are made continuously. If one cannot forgive someone for something, they cannot forvive themself for the same thing. If one accepts onself (all versions), one accepts all other ones.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 62753, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Piety and Shame", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572086528, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dig4fv/piety_and_shame/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "vibelord", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_x0ie6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571178204, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/difkkt/we_are_all_one/", "gildings": {}, "id": "difkkt", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Enlightenment"}], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/difkkt/we_are_all_one/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571178209, "score": 2, "selftext": "I came to the conclusion that every - being is actually connected.

After months (some happened years after I dreamt them) they just happen in real life (almost) identical to how itbhappened in the dream. \nI am a scientist but always had an inclination towards spirituality and think science and sipituality/belief complement each other.

Then she\u2019s out. I\u2019ve been doing LSD and mushrooms,  Perception of reality changed from it. \nI feel you put an act on everytime you express yourself. Having intercourse now feels like a deep act, fake in other words. Feels like i meet people for the first time again. Time feels like an enternity and non-existant at the same time. I didn\u2019t come at this to get a answer, but i feel i got a question anyways. I always tell my self i don\u2019t need to ask questions because i know i have them, but i feel as if i may could need advice on what to do with her, I do keep in mind that no one will ever know the care and love and how deep the expressions of the act go, but i feel strongly on the part that i create my reality, even for others. She is on her spiritual journey, Kind of In the start, shes meditating, starting to innerstand things and when i met her she was really In the system, still is tho, but she realized that she can do anything she sets her mind to do, she resonates with everything a spiritual person do, but she wont associate with it. It\u2019s like she\u2019s standing on the answers, but the attachment to the act of her way of being is keeping her intact to let go, she thinks she get\u2019s bad vibes from people doing \u00abdrugs\u00bb. I tell her you set your own values and that you created that reality/story. My question is; If i change my perception of her, could i make her open her eyes and innerstand that it\u2019s not me doing \u00abdrugs\u00bb thats causing her bad vibes, because she told me everyone that does it gives her that so it\u2019s obviously an act she accepted as her reality. Note i\u2019ve been smoking since the relationship started and it was never a problem until she got to hang around and perceive of us smoke alot. Another reason for it is that she tells me im throwing my talent away, she really cares a lot about economics and money saving, it\u2019s like money is her god and by her seeing me \u00abthrow away money\u00bb on drugs it makes her perceive of me as less, I wanna open her eyes to the abundance of no lack, and realize she creates her own story. Can i change my perception of her too make her perceive that wich her act won\u2019t let her?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 62723, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Relationship Advice", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572083605, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/did5uh/relationship_advice/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "menjac21", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_qfsjd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571168199, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/did415/energy_healing_for_sickness_or_cancer_symptoms/", "gildings": {}, "id": "did415", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/did415/energy_healing_for_sickness_or_cancer_symptoms/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "lpyK3-HGF1YN42P3NlAzxeElumSeFwtSql9uJwo25Ls", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/6Vrdt_c8sN8rpXBD31EihWUFTVQjPN-zP6CtQH45dkw.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=455c3f793536ae64fb4a6960f6793a0727d2b306", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/6Vrdt_c8sN8rpXBD31EihWUFTVQjPN-zP6CtQH45dkw.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=498f5c9e82ffc36c9449318cac0b60bbb2b700f6", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/6Vrdt_c8sN8rpXBD31EihWUFTVQjPN-zP6CtQH45dkw.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5ba703009dc64ec01f03ceb3e899f5de43cab48", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/6Vrdt_c8sN8rpXBD31EihWUFTVQjPN-zP6CtQH45dkw.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=86853e1add24f3feef1237f88595d27fab856e12", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1571168446, "score": 1, "selftext": "I will warn you that im not saying that im a doctor or some kind of health professional.\n\nbut try to watch this video and focus on any symptoms you have of any kind of health issue.\n\nthen let your focus go back to your breath and do nothing. at the end of the video come back to the symptoms and see if they changed.\n\nre-watch the video as many time as you want\n\nSource [https://youtu.be/o7Q07qYp0WQ](https://youtu.be/o7Q07qYp0WQ)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 62722, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Energy healing for sickness or cancer symptoms", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572083582, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/did415/energy_healing_for_sickness_or_cancer_symptoms/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "slumpttx", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5veictu", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571167401, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dicwrh/how_to_deal_with_the_physical_world_while_being/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dicwrh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dicwrh/how_to_deal_with_the_physical_world_while_being/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571167899, "score": 1, "selftext": "Going through a rough patch in life at the moment.

I kept having pictures of it in my mind and it just felt like someone was telling me to use it, there wasn't an actual voice or anything but it felt like there was something pushing me to use it. Eventually I got fed up and went and got it and used it with a pendulum mat (image on my phone, because I don't have one) and anyways.. the answers were interesting. I was honestly surprised but I looked it up after and I wasn't doing it the proper way with feet on the floor and the pendulum wasn't cleansed.

I'm a college student from Mumbai, India and I'm doing research on how mindfulness meditation can help manage stress after regular practice. Since I do not know many people who meditate regularly I thought this subreddit would be the best place to ask for help.\n\nThe rationale for this research is to evaluate whether mindfulness meditation helps manage perceived stress in individuals. From my own personal experience, I have observed that mindfulness meditation has helped me change the way I perceive stress and my own personal identity. Hence, I hope to help other people who are in need to change how they perceive stress through mindfulness meditation.\n\nThe first part of the questionnaire is the perceived stress scale by Sheldon Cohen, which you will have to answer twice, the first time in retrospect of the time before you used to meditate and how you perceived stress back then and then the second time by answering how you perceive stress now after regular practice of mindfulness meditation. The second part of the questionnaire is about your practice of mindfulness meditation.\n\nIf you guys respond and I can conduct my research then I will post my findings along with my research paper soon so that the people who take part in the research can read what they helped create.\n\nYou can ask any questions related to my research in the comments and if you want I can also share a note which explains how I plan to carry out my research.

Sometimes journaling helps.  What matters is it actually works for you, brings you out of the state you are in and allows for a bigger perspective of whatever the circumstance is.\n\nSome may say that the reason you aren't getting the benefit of a particular spiritual practice is because you're not practicing enough.  That has not been my experience.  The practices that work for me, worked right from the get go and weren't hard to do... BUT, remembering to do them when I'm upset, that can be hard.  So, that is part of my practice, too... the remembering.\n\nI encourage you to not settle for a  spiritual practice that can't absolutely heal whatever upset, annoyance or anger you're experiencing at any given moment and when you found a practice that works, begin the practice of remembering to do that practice when you need it most.\n\nlove you;\n\nRev.

It means perceiving **reality as it is** in existence and  always being in a state of happiness.   \n\n\nBeing spiritually awakened or enlightened means your acceptance, evaluation, and comparison of all options is based on truth and justice that are your innate/default characteristics as a human being. You are able to understand the purpose of existence and are able to understand all the phenomena; the coexistence of matter and the energy or god or the unknown as they refer to it.\n\nSpiritually awakened means knowing and understanding everything through proper reasoning. You can understand every element in existence and are able to do justice to your interactions with this existence. Be it a human being, animal, plants or matter, as an enlightened being you understand its utility in the whole cosmos and deal with it in a just and equitable way.\n\nThat is a big change that happens. The study of coexistence helps you reach that state. **No fancy rituals or mysterious angels or any penances.**\n\nSimple straight forward logic of evolution and how the universe is.\n\nBeing awakened can be simply understood as knowing existence as coexistence and maneuvering imagination to align the wrong perception with actual reality (reality as it is). Once the perception is aligned with the reality, then there is no rolling back. That is complete and final.\n\n**Till our perceived reality created using our imagination is in variance with existential reality, there is always going to be a correction of moving towards reality. That may look like an awakening and then going back and then reawakening.

I am offering another day of free 20 minute Reiki sessions for 5 clients tomorrow (Tuesday) and 5 clients for Wednesday to promote my new practice. \ud83d\ude0a\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT - PLEASE READ BELOW\n\nI ONLY schedule and sessions and practise through WhatsApp. If you would like to schedule a session with me, send me a message on here with your first name, approximate location (for better connection) and complete WhatsApp number including the international dialing code (+) and your desired appointment time in GMT+3 (MY timezone), Google will help you work out what the time will be in your timezone if you are unsure. Apologies, but if you do not include all of this in your message to me I can't respond to you as I do not have the time for the back and forth pingpong messaging so please be mindful of this and message me accordingly. \ud83d\ude0a\n\n\n\n\nDuring the session, I always advise my clients to lay down on their back in a comfortable position without any distractions in the room, you may want to switch off your phone etc. \n\n\nAvailable appointment times to choose from for both days (GMT+3) \n(Only applicable for Taster Sessions)\n\n*FRIENDLY REMINDER*\nIf you message me for a booking, we agree on a time and I pencil you in, please either let me know if something has come up and you cant make it, we can always reschedule. Otherwise, please try to not forget the appointment as it both wastes my time which I could used working with someone else. Not to sound rude but it does waste time that can be well spent, so just a friendly reminder :)\n\n\n\n12pm\n\n1pm\n\n2pm\n\n3pm\n\n4pm\n\n\nJust also note that I can \"time\" the Reiki for you to receive it at whatever time best suits you, for example if you live in Los Angeles and can not make one of these times and want to receive the Reiki at 10pm when you go to bed, I can time the Reiki for you to receive it then. In this case I will still send you a voice note as a report of the session after I have finished but I would highly recommend that you do not listen to it until you have receieved the session yourself at the time agreed upon, this will not distort any healing energies of course but other things might come up in your energy body that I may not be aware of if you first listen to thenreport and then recieve your Reiki. I will still send you the links to listen to the Reiki music for duri g the session. Most of my clients do prefer to receive \"live\" sessions, to receive at the same time I am sending but in my client's busy schedules, this is not always achievable everytime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany

He is already under strict material laws. But, as soon as he acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is liberated, free from the material perplexities.

My alter is clean and I offered my goddess and ancestors more than just water. \n\nIdk. I\u2019m proud of myself. And I hope that this not only leads to results, but that my guides see that I\u2019m trying. I\u2019m trying to clearly connect with them. To make a clear bath to hear what they have to say.

I really don't want to get into how I started having these thoughts as they may come across as strange, but ever since the start of those thoughts, I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. \n\nAbout a week into questioning, one night I woke up from  dream. I knew I was awake and changed my sleeping position. Shortly after, I felt an intense tingling sensation from the top of my scalp to the back of my scalp. Along with this feeling I heard a high pitch frequency. The tingling sensation just got more and more intense and the frequency got higher, this lasted for about 5 seconds. After this, everything just stopped and went quiet. I felt as if I was transported somewhere, but all I saw was darkness. I felt as if something next was going to happen but I was freaked out and opened my eyes. \n\nThis experience made me do some research and I found out about Chakras and the spiritual dimension. The question I have is that this happened naturally without any prior knowledge of this and it was a really intense experience, why do you think this is? Iv'e been looking into mediation and reading up on the Third Eye. I hope to open it one day and I think I can, but I want to prepare and not jump right into it as I know there is good and bad to what can be experienced from it. Thank you for reading this.

I was, up to this point, in a very introspective state of mind; I pondered on my childhood; how I was diagnosed with Sensory Processing Disorder as a very young child and being treated for it until I was 10, how my parents divorced (right around that time) and it left a deep rift in both sides of my family, how it caused me to seek comfort in food thus causing my weight to balloon, my struggles with the public school system, socializing with others in a meaningful way, and mostly,  my battle with depression and suicidal ideation. I was naturally an atypical and sensitive kid, so these events left emotional wounds that seemed to exacerbate if I didn\u2019t distract myself. \n\nExpressing myself has always come very naturally to me. I created plenty of videos, songs, stories, art, comics, and imaginary worlds, and they all helped me immensely with making sense of the world and how it worked.  I have a natural knack for music, and I developed my skills by writing songs and then figuring out the instrumentation on the lyrics I wrote. I penned a two-part album series throughout my adolescence about  loneliness, despair, rage, mania, suicide, and bitterness. It paradoxically gave me a sense of purpose throughout my difficult high school days, when my mom and boyfriend broke up and I was failing my classes. Through writing and expressing the feelings and thoughts of my shadow self, I found immense relief. I am still working on this project now (I\u2019m currently 19 years old), but writing it kept me from completely losing hope in life during those dark times. It was extremely cathartic.\n\nBut now, as I have graduated and am progressing with my life, I see very clearly that a vast majority of these happenings were no fault of my own, a belief I often took in self-loathing. I had a rough upbringing, and the pain from my past was largely circumstantial. I have been smoking weed and using psychedelics for about two years now, and they have both served as excellent tools at helping me realize the infinite beauty of the moment, here and now. Revealing your true self (allow me to paraphrase Alan Watts here) is a matter of unfurling and discarding illusions by saying \u201cnot this, not this\u201d until you arrive at what is, and I explored my mind through psychedelics to find out what was false in order to reveal what is true. I wasn\u2019t getting it, and after a few LSD trips, the psychedelic teacher laid it bare: I had work to do.  I am in a position that is causing me to hurt, and it is my duty to become whole and actualized again. This was a few months ago.\n\nSince my last trip, I\u2019ve sincerely been making a concentrated effort at bettering myself. Eating better, exercising, sleeping healthily, taking care of my needs, meditating, and socializing come much easier than before due to repeated practice, regardless of my current mood. I started to feel something deep within startle when I began looking into Jiddu Krishnamurti and his work. After finishing \u201cTotal Freedom\u201d and understanding that truth is a path less land &amp; that the observer is the observed, I picked up \u201cBe Here Now\u201d by Ram Dass very recently. Taking us back to the beginning, I was laying on my bed, in revery. My knack for expression, my suicidal thoughts, my trying past, and my experiences with psychedelic drugs are part of a vast journey that has been lovingly and mercifully laid out for me, one that I\u2019ve been on for much longer than this physical incarnation. I feel, with incredible credence, that I willingly killed myself in a previous life, and that I was reincarnated back into this material universe to overcome my challenges and live a bountiful life of love and light, despite my environment or circumstances. I have been put on Planet Earth, as a human being, to redeem myself for willingly taking the life that Mother graciously gave to me. She gave me another chance, in Her infinite and utter forgiveness, to experience the sensation of being alive and breathing. \n\nAfter realizing this, my outlook on life has instantly been transformed from seemingly random bouts of meaningless suffering, to a fresh and hopeful gift that is totally and completely incorruptible by anyone or anything. This new worldview operates seamlessly in the here and now, as opposed to the now being a source of pain to constantly run away from. The sheer magnitude of this awakening reduced me to tears, and it only took a little bit of weed and a lot of discarding old, illusory, and inadequate worldviews.   My dharma is redemption, and I will use my gift of music to inspire others to transform, connect, and transcend. You are me, I am you, and we are source.

I'm wondering: why is it that starving the ego works fantastically for some, while for others it destroys them? I am a personal belief that there is no objective way of living life and that people should only do that which works for them. This means that when a person claims that everyone should starve the ego, or when a person claims that this isn't the right way to go and that everyone should learn how to live with their ego, they are presenting what works for themselves as an objective truth by which everyone should live by. I thought, then: what if both ways are actually right? What if, for example, people who deal with mental disorders (especially those which influence/affect the image of the self) not operating from ego is the best way to go (otherwise they can get caught in too many illusions which would destroy the heart) and for those who are mentally healthy and deal with the stressed of the external world (which influence the internal world) must learn how to coexist with their egos? \n\nWhat do you think?

I do not struggle with extreme emotional instability.  Stress and aggravation is something I do struggle with.  I learned at a young age to control negative emotions and positive emotions.  I learned about general views on morality and ethical behaviour.  A lot of people seem to be consumed with anger or jealousy or masochism.  I've met a lot of people that take pleasure at demoralizing others\n\nSo it's not something I understand myself when I see people consumed with anger or jealousy.  I'm grateful not to really struggle with jealousy or masochism.  Anger is something I've generally overcome.  For a time I thought displaying anger was a normal or acceptable response.  I later came to a realization it was weak and unacceptable of me to give into bronze in trying to make my points.  It separates us from animals, are ability to be different.  Our senses of morality and ethical conduct.  It's hard with passive aggressive people being the norm, they're intolerable at times.\n\nI don't have any pro-tips for Taoism or Stoicism, since they're a little alike.  Just remembering to be self aware and able to acknowledge when you are wrong in an argument.  I struggle with people antagonizing me to the point where I become confrontational.  Being confrontational isn't wrong, passive aggressive people are wrong.  Passive aggressive people are wrong and usually do not admit to their own faults.\n\nI too go off the path of balance after being antagonized so long.  I deal with people pestering me all the time.  I often do not realize I've gone right and am ready to mercilessly pulverize a mother fucker to death.  Then I catch myself, bite my tongue, darwin i-ching, find my center.  Or I go off on a psychotic episode having completely lost control.  It's been years again now and all had been relatively well.  I'm not proud of these things and an deeply ashamed.  \n\nFor a time I sobered up, a year here or there, before I cracked.  I realized these things are barbiturates indeed, and something people should know are.  Not excuses to be used, drugs and alcohol.  Using drugs and alcohol as an excuse is deeply shameful as well and I'm fortunate enough not to have used them as excuses.  I mentioned these things in good humor and it's really not funny either.  \n\nIf you suffer from some instability and are a recreational drug and alcohol user, you should give sobriety a try.  Give it a few weeks, not a few days, you may find yourself thinking much more clearly.  Being able to acknowledge these things will help on the path of stability.  \n\nHowever, there were nutritional faults of mine causing some of my struggle.  Again, I'm not using such things as an excuse.  When you drink alcohol your glucose and electrolytes flush and you may find yourself a bit crazed, and ravenous. I fast regularly and overtime came to realize some of my issues were do to a lack of B12, Iron and sugars.  Keep this in mind as well when you smash some hard Vodka.  I knew about electrolytes being an issue and thought I was getting them while fasting.  My B12 and Iron was something that is nominally in meat, and meat is what I thirsted for.  I read up on meat cravings and learned it was often linked to B12 and Iron deficiency, so increasing my intake of these things did help entirely.\n\nOther than nutrition and exercise, I can't explain much else.  The metaphysics of energy and how it affects us.  For thousands of years now we've heard about crystals and tai-chi and superstitions.  I can not verify these things and do not know if burning a certain type of herb or incense will chase off the negative energies.  \n\nThink positive and mean to be a positive person, full of love and pleasant energy!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 62303, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Remaining Stoic", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572052273, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dhgp56/remaining_stoic/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "itswik", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4f61cc7j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571001189, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dhgo7y/contacting_a_spirit_guide_in_a_foreign_language/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dhgo7y", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dhgo7y/contacting_a_spirit_guide_in_a_foreign_language/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571001190, "score": 3, "selftext": "It might sound bit weird but is it possible to have the first contact with your spirit guide in a language that's not your mother tongue?

Me talking to and comforting myself, My ego voice and what I believe to be my higher self.\n\nOkay, so I often wake up at 3 in the morning due to panic attacks. I had to force myself to go to sleep somehow, so, I used this technique. It's basically meditation, but in the meditation I focus on something beautiful. I will close my eyes, lie In bed and breath deeply, in and out, then I will, at the same time, Imagine a beautiful place. One such place is a place I created for a story I am going to write. It's a victorian house, I am in a big beautiful garden of purple and pink blooms that surrounds the house, The sky is blue and the sun shines most all of the time. \n\nWell, i had used this technique one time about a few days ago, and I heard a soft, comforting voice. I was consoling myself at the time, and did not expect to hear a voice. I kept telling myself, It's going to be okay. then the voice responded yes it is. I don't remember exactly what she had said, because I was basically putting myself in this dream like, hypnogogic state. It was hypnogogic and when I come out of that state I have to write things down fast or I can't remember them.\n\nAnyway, The voice was SO CLEAR. Not exactly loud, because she was just as loud as my ego self, who had freaked me out!\n\nThe ego voice said, \"Heaaaaaattthhhheeerrr, SHE'S WATCHING YOU!\" and one of those images of a samara looking girl with white eyes appeared in my minds eye, but I knew it was my ego voice trying to scare me, well, as soon as I got past that I began to feel this safe loving presence, who I suspected to be my higher self. Before when I saw the girl with black hair, which of course, was just a fear and a just a dream of mine (It actually was a picture i saw online at a young age LOL) \n\nBack to the main point, I later envisioned a girl with brown hair that glowed amber in the sunlight, this I suspect was my higher self, but It could've just been me dreaming because after all I was in the half awake half asleep state. So I basically envisioned this safe place in my mind, then I heard her voice. It was crystal clear speaking and not as in my face as the ego voice. \n\nShe had a very soft, calming voice and a reassuring, safe presence. I felt really loved and safe overall. \n\nI once meditated for just 4 days and had some pretty mindblowing experiences! One time I had a tablet in hand and was watching a spiritual video. Well, I started to fall asleep (this was after one of my meditation sessions) and In my hypnogogic state I began feeling myself drawing a circle interconnected with another circle. So, I was basically drawing a diagram. Then I violently jerk awake. On the tablet at that very moment, was a diagram!!!! The person in the video NEVER EVEN MENTIONED a diagram or circles. He called it a vescica peces (not sure if that is spelled right, sorry!) \n\nAfter, these meditations I began experiencing incredible synchronicites and in general, just KNOWING and FEELING the answer to questions I've had. I would even know, mostly, feel future events and often predicted them right! It reminds me of this one time, I had been meditating and in my meditation, I accidentally fell in the hygnagogic state. Well, while i was in it, I had this crazy vision dream thing where I was flying through a tunnel of purple- blue sparkles, the background was black. I'm not sure what was on the other side of the sparkle tunnel thing because I was so shocked I woke up completely!\n\nI just feel that those are some of the times, my higher self tried getting to me. (communicating with me) I just never heard her voice up until now. \n\nAm I really hearing her voice, I feel sure when In that state, but when I'm awake and doing normal everyday things, I doubt my experiences. \n\nAnyway,\n\nThanks again, It's a long read (AGAIN, sorry), but I need some help in understanding this. Also, has anyone else had similar experiences they'd like to share, I would LOVE to read some. \n\n\\-Heather.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 62288, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Have I been connecting to my higher self the right way.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572051228, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dhfruz/have_i_been_connecting_to_my_higher_self_the/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "aims222", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_25krkrqr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570995577, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dhfdky/dmt/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dhfdky", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dhfdky/dmt/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570995578, "score": 1, "selftext": "Alot of people suggest smoking dmt for mind opening experiences, I'm just wondering how one can get there hands on such a substance ?

This ongoing spiritual growth also had me come to a realization I posted in r/awakening [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/awakened/comments/dd9y4o/understanding_that_i_am_the_answer/), that we are all God, and the answer we have been looking for is inside of us the whole time. \n\nWhen it comes to Christianity, I don\u2019t follow the religion seriously anymore. But, my family and girlfriend still go to church and I still go with them. I\u2019ve had the Christian mindset for so long, I\u2019m finding it hard to leave, even though I don\u2019t agree with most of the religious beliefs. I no longer believe Jesus is the only son of God, since I've come to the realization we are all God and always connected to the universe or Source.\n\nWhenever I go to church now, the creeds they say and the rituals they observe like confession just feels so wrong. And the whole \"you're going to hell because you don't believe this\" thing also feels horrible and wrong, and goes against anything unconditional love would even consider. My spiritual transformation over the past few months involved loving myself more and viewing myself in a completely different light. I am a part of God, and I am already perfect, and I am unconditional love at the core. Now, I get really mad at the church and their stubborn dogmas, and quite honestly I see it as cult-like. I see all the people walking up to communion with sorrow in their eyes, ready to confess their sins, and I'm just standing there wanting to scream at them, \"YOU ARE ALREADY GOD, YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THIS!!!\" I feel stuck in this place between religious tradition and exploration of my own spiritual path. The issue is fundamental Christians are so stuck in their ways, I can't talk about it with this group of people without making it seem to them like I'm talking with demons and playing with Satan. I don't want to have to deal with this, because I feel nothing but unconditional love when I meditate and raise my consciousness to a higher level in order to hear clearly from the universe or my higher self. I'm afraid my family will misunderstand what I'm going through as well, even though I know they are all viewing this situation at a higher spiritual level anyway in higher states of consciousness. I just love everyone in my church so much and I love my family of course, and I just wish they would not be so certain and closed-minded (like I used to be) that their religion is the only true religion in the world, because it's not. There's so much more to this life spiritually than what religion can offer, at least to me.\n\nThere's the whole issue with Jesus as well, since he claimed to be the Son of God. Part of me believes Jesus really did all those incredible miracles like healing and raising from the dead, but I can't get on board with the \"believe only in me, or you will perish\" stuff. Perhaps that isn't the original intended message he wanted to get across, but it's hard to tell since so much time has past since Jesus.\n\nI'm sorry, I know a bit of that was rambling.

I wanted to share this article I found about spiritual illness, which appears to be a common and often overlooked cause of both physical and psychological problems that many experience.\n\nIf you experience any of the 10 symptoms listed in the article, it is worth considering that there may be a spiritual cause to your ailment, but do not rule out biological and psychological factors either. My two favourite points are listed below, with my thoughts on it:\n\n**2. Resentment, anger, and blame**\n\nIt is quite common, and even natural, to feel anger towards others when they have sinned against us, but we must try to avoid the trap of remaining in a cycle of blame, and resentment. Arguably the best solution to this problem is to practice forgiveness, and learn to let go of the mistakes and wrongs of the past so you have move forward with a healthier soul and state of mind.\n\n**6. Apathy and listlessness**\n\nMany become apathetic in life, and lose their sense of meaning or purpose, and often this is rooted in neglecting their spiritual side. Some people act as though spirituality isn\u2019t even a thing, and often their pay for this ignorance with a lack of connection to the world and lack of fulfilment.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 62235, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "10 Signs of Spiritual Illness (and How to Heal Them)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572045880, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dhauw7/10_signs_of_spiritual_illness_and_how_to_heal_them/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Lx789", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4iqjzcz0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570974268, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dhar9q/visual_snow/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dhar9q", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 25, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dhar9q/visual_snow/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570974268, "score": 8, "selftext": "I am just wondering if anybody else has experienced 'visual snow'?

Anytime I feel him working through him it gives me the most secure feeling because sometimes I fear my own humanity; I fear not tuning into him because I have convinced myself I am not worthy. I trust myself because I trust him; I trust others because I trust him and I trust myself. This cannot happen if I am not connected and that scares me, but that fear is false because regardless he works through me in the form of my thoughts. He's always putting thoughts in my mind and I want to stay there and focus on that all the time rather than the irrational thoughts. I'm done with the irrational thoughts.

The following day I decided to push my luck a little more and got another reading. This new reading came out to be called 'blessing'; that was the name of the card. The card basically said that blessings would be on my way. The last sign took place earlier today. I found a video on youtube that was about communicating with my spirit angels/higher self and the person in the video said just allow things to happen and don't worry about the how; just go with the flow and follow the signs. :) Well, little did I know, tonight literally not even an hour ago my blessing came to me and it's amazing, so good that i can't stop crying and feeling so loved and protected right now.

In such devotional service, be fully conscious of Me.**\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nWhen one acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he does not act as the master of the world. Just like a servant, one should act fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord. A servant has no individual independence. He acts only on the order of the master. A servant acting on behalf of the supreme master has no affection for profit and loss. He simply discharges his duty faithfully in terms of the order of the Lord. Now, one may argue that Arjuna was acting under the personal direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not present, how should one act? If one acts according to the direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this book, as well as under the guidance of the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then the result will be the same. The Sanskrit word mat-para\u1e25 is very important in this verse. It indicates that one has no goal in life save and except acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness just to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And, while working in that way, one should think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only: \"I have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\" While acting in such a way, one naturally has to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is perfect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should, however, note that, after doing something whimsically, he should not offer the result to the Supreme Lord. That sort of duty is not in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should act according to the order of Kr\u1e63na. This is a very important point. That order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master. Therefore the spiritual master's order should be taken as the prime duty of life. If one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his direction, then his perfection of life in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is guaranteed.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the significance of the Sanskrit word mat-para\u1e25 with reference to this verse ?**\n\n[Picture : Bhagavad-gita 18.57](https://gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/57)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false,

I'm in my final year of university and the semester has begun, I was hopeful for a great year, however I've been feeling so sad. I get thoughts of feeling ugly again, I feel so so lonely, and I feel lost in my life, so lost. As it's my final year, I feel pressure of wanting this year to go right, so I want to sort out my life as soon as possible.\n\nI've done some research and it seems that maybe exploring spirituality, meditation, some form of rules and routine, could help me regain a grasp on my life. \n These are the issues I most struggle with: \n\n- Anxiety (worrying so much about others' opinions, and I often get stomach pains from anxiety)\n- Lonliness (feeling alone even if I have friends/family around me, feeling like I need a girlfriend to be happy)\n- Stress (if I can succeed in life, questioning my goals, my purpose, who I am. I rarely sleep well)\n- Obsessive with girls (I have always got easily attached and fallen for girls, who are often my close friends, I'm currently in love with my best friend for 3 years and get very depressed at the realisation that I can't be with her. I also think about her lustfully often and feel regret and guilt for it)\n\nI'd like to get past these issues, I feel they're stopping me from being able to enjoy life and be happy. I'm terrified of becoming suicidal again, I hate being so sad. I want to let go of my earthly tethers, to be happy. I'm open to the idea of praying more, meditating, tai chi, anything, but I don't know where to begin and how to do it. \n\nIf you read all this, thank you so much, and if you have any advice for me, I would appreciate it so much.

"pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570932974, "score": 2, "selftext": "\n\u00a0\"This universe has been created for a purpose, for a reason.\u00a0 And the reason for this creation is to bring the darkness that was formed in the very beginning because a part of the essence separated itself from God, to turn and go back to Light and Oneness with God.\n\nTwelve thousand years ago God decided to create man the way he is now, and to create the history so when we reach to this point, many of those who have been meditating, progressing, and have been incarnated for many lifetimes will be called to come together to help the darkness to turn around and go to God, which is the goal of life.\n\nOf course, before the history and twelve thousand years ago, a Path has been founded by the Spirit of God, which went through that darkness and went through that Path and eventually reached the Light.\u00a0 And that Path became the essence of progress for the darkness to turn around and go back to the Light.\u00a0 That Path is called, the\u00a0Eternal Divine Path.\nThis Path has five steps and two results.\u00a0 God has been sending the revelations to humanity for the last twelve thousand years and revealing a part of this\u00a0Path\u00a0in the major religions on earth.\n\nThe first step in this Path is the Mystical Paths or the awakening of the spiritual forces in man, which are latent in the base of their spines.\u00a0 Many techniques have been given all through history to accomplish this.\u00a0\n\nThis Path was revealed after the flood of Noah by Noah to his children, and spread all over the earth, and eventually became the Spirit behind all religions.\u00a0 And the religions that mostly follow this\u00a0Path\u00a0are Hinduism, Buddhism, Kabbala, Christian Saints, Sufis, and many other cultures that follow the saying, \"Know thyself to know God,\" or, \"Be Still and know that I am,\" or my essence is, \"God.\"\n\u00a0\nMany of these religions or Mystical People believe that is the only way to go to God.\u00a0 They believe that God is not an explanation but It is an experience.\u00a0 Therefore, they give you the tools to experience that mystical state of unification or unity with God.\u00a0 However, that is not the end of the spiritual path.\nThe second step is the creation of the\u00a0Communities of Light.\u00a0 That part of the plan of God was revealed in the Old Testament where God is trying to find a people, the twelve tribes of Israel, to become His people, accept Him as their King, and follow His Laws so they can create a community based on the Spirit of God.\u00a0 At the same time God promised Abram or Abraham that his children (the child of Abram was Ishmael, and the child of Abraham was Isaac) also would each bring a revelation to humanity.\u00a0\nThe next step in the creation of the\u00a0Communities of Light\u00a0is to sacrifice.\u00a0 \n\nIn order to create the community that is based on God and people can live in, in peace and unity without fear, insecurity, and violence, that the people will know each other, they will come to understand one another, and will become familiar with each other, you have to give of yourself in this community and become involved in it so you can know each other and eventually become One.\n\nThis part of the\u00a0Eternal Divine Path\u00a0is the New Testament.\u00a0 Christ brought it to humanity by sacrificing himself and showing, \"Love your neighbor as you love yourself.\"\u00a0 The community that is based on selfishness, self-centeredness, disunity, and not sharing will not bring peace, unity, and security to such a community.\n\nAs we sacrifice and we try to establish the\u00a0Communities of Light, we might not succeed and therefore we become discouraged.\u00a0 We might fall off from the\u00a0Path.\u00a0 Or we might succeed, and we become elated and take the credit.\u00a0 Ego comes in and again we will fall.\n\nTherefore, the next step is surrendering and submission to the Will of God.\u00a0 Surrendering means we do our best to create the\u00a0Communities of Light.\u00a0 We do our best to sacrifice in the\u00a0Communities of Light.\u00a0 We meditate, we awaken our spiritual forces, but we surrender the result to God.\u00a0\n\nWe say, \"OK, I did my best that I can do, or I know how to do, but I surrender the result to God.\u00a0 Therefore I am not attached to the result.\u00a0 Whatever the result is, I look at it, I improve on what I do, I will try to do better or improve whatever is not correct and Holy, and surrender the result to You.\u00a0 And eventually I will find the best way to bring the Kingdom of God on earth.\"\n\nEven greater than surrendering is submission.\u00a0 It is to realize that God is the Doer, and you are just a channel for His Doing.\u00a0 And because God is perfect, you will do the perfect job.\n\nThis is also what Christ taught that, Do your best and glorify God.\u00a0 And Prophet Muhammad said, \"You did not throw the spear, but God did.\"\u00a0 That means that when God comes through, that is perfection.\u00a0 If we truly let Him come through, we do perfectly.\nThis revelation of surrendering and submission came through Prophet Muhammad to humanity.\u00a0 Islam is the fourth seal in the\u00a0Eternal Divine Path.\n\nHowever, still in that state we might become interested only in our own community, in our own nation, in our own religion, and narrowness of the mind might still creep in and not let us see God in Its whole Glory.\u00a0 The next step is to shatter all the narrowness of the mind and recognize that God is indeed everything.\u00a0\n\nWhen God saw the darkness He had to create this universe with His own Body and the darkness so He could help them to turn around and go back to the Essence.\u00a0 This creation has been created by the Body of God, therefore, God indeed is everything.\nIf He is everything then our home is the universe, and our parents are God (in the two states of male and female, father and mother), and we do not belong to any specific area in the world, or religion, or gender, but the essence of every man, and woman, and child is God.\u00a0 Everything else also belongs to God and is God.\u00a0\n\nTherefore, we become universalists.\u00a0 We shatter all the narrowness of the mind.\u00a0 We free ourselves of all the bondages that this external world can put on us, and we become free of those narrowing ideas that man is so attached to.\u00a0 This revelation has come through Bab and Baha'u'llah who brought the Baha'i religion to humanity, and they are the Fifth Seal in the\u00a0Eternal Divine Path.\n\nAnyone who tries to awaken their spiritual forces, meditates, contemplates, concentrates, and follows all the rituals and techniques that have been given to them to awaken the spirit within and eventually experience God, or, even before experiencing God completely, joins a\u00a0Community of Light\u00a0or at least tries to create one, and realizes that in order to create the\u00a0Communities of Light\u00a0they have to sacrifice in the\u00a0Communities of Light\u00a0for the\u00a0Communities of Light, then surrenders and submits the results of their actions to God and becomes a universalist...these five steps make them to become the Elects.\n\nElects are those who follow the\u00a0Eternal Divine Path\u00a0and shatter all narrowness of the mind and also create other qualities that are explained in our teachings.\u00a0 The Elects are the Sixth Seal in the\u00a0Eternal Divine Path.\u00a0 They are the ones that God has revealed to humanity through all His Scriptures, \"My Elects,\" \"The salt of the world,\" those who listen to God and His Prophets and follow the revelations of God.\nIt is these Elects that are called by God at this

P.R.

Like a curse. Your relationship with the person will end inevitably, sooner or later. \n\nI wasn\u2019t sure if there was any truth behind this superstition until it happened to me. Once upon a time, years ago, I was madly in love with my ex. I, being a young and dumb teenager, decided to get his name tattooed. Our relationship was never stable, it was extremely toxic but we were on/off for about 4 years. A few months after I got the tattoo done, we ended our relationship for good. As crazy as this sounds, it\u2019s like the tattoo I got of his name signified the end of our relationship. It\u2019s just a feeling I get. Anyways, long story short, he ended up leaving me for someone else, got her name tattooed.. low and behold, their relationship came to an end shortly after. \n\nThis may sound silly to some but I truly do believe getting your SO name tattooed is \u201cthe kiss of death\u201d to your relationship. Not only because of my experience, but because it\u2019s consistently happened to others. Every relationship I\u2019ve known of/read about/heard of, in which someone gets their partners name tattooed, they end up breaking up. \n\nIf it\u2019s happened to so many people, there has to be some truth to it, right? What are your thoughts? Does getting your SO\u2019s name curse the relationship on some spiritual level? \n\nI came across this while reading about relationship tattoo curses: * Because tattoos are permanent, because of the pure loving intent behind the initial application of the tattoos, and because the changes on the molecular level can be permanent, this could on a spiritual level tie each partner together in something of a soul contract where perhaps in a next lifetime they will need to reunite or be forced to reunite to \u201ctry again.\u201d Or in more extreme cases (which I know is in my case here actually): the couple, on a spirit level, vow that they will never be apart again \u2013so they will always reunite in subsequent lifetimes \u2026 that is until the original soul contract is eliminated/cancelled out.* \n\nWhat do you think of the whole soul contract theory and always reuniting in subsequent lifetimes because of the tattoo itself making a spiritual tie between two individuals?

Their work has opened my eyes to a reality I could have never even dreamed of and one which I want to share with you all.\n\nBeyond The Veil is a feature documentary that explores life after death. Told through the eyes of those born with the gift of communicating with the spirit world, this film shines a light on the evidence and personal accounts of what really happens in the afterlife.\u00a0 Backed by the latest research on consciousness, Beyond the Veil is the first of its kind film that aims to bridge the gap between the psychic and scientific world and to provide hope and proof of the afterlife.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNow, with 80% of the filming done, I need everyone\u2019s support to help me see this vision come to completion and tell a story that deserves to be told and most importantly help those who are grieving.

\"death\". i don't feel connected to this material reality, i don't connect with people down here, i don't feel like i can reach my full potential here and i can only be truly myself in higher dimensions where body, identity and everything that we know here is gone, where we are only soul connected to the earth and the universe. i believe we are flesh that turns to dust then back to the

I too struggle with trying to keep things confidential as so many people desire.  I can't verify any of my vision is tangible to the truth and I wanted to help expose the truth.  I wanted to liberate people from piety and these religions I did not believe in since I am apparently the reincarnation of the Most High.  I would rather not fill peoples heads with bullshit and am not trying to compensate and make people think I'm just not delusional.  \n\nI had encounters with numerous other supposed deities over the years amid some debacles of them apparently trying to meet or detour me.  The was a lot of arguments over the years, I was just trying to be as discreet as possible.  Anytime I start talking about this it's usually an indentured session of being chewed out by dozens of different people.  It drives me crazy, this opportunity to end this bullshit in the world.  Many want to let it pass, 2000 years of war and atrocities, no retribution, just let it pass.  I'm unable to bring anyone closure on anything regarding these beings, Christ or God or Elves.  \n\nThings are subject to change, but, I'm doing the best I can to cope.  I've marveled at my own coping devices, including insanity and alcoholism.  I've kept of the smack and opium, that alone is something to be proud of.  I've also held a job now going on 3 1/2 years and been working again around 5 years during this insanity.  I do not know how the others are doing, probably all on disability at the bottom of a bottle of vodka too.  Being destitute has it's pro's and con's I couldn't make it in school, school sucks.  So I must end up working 60-80hrs a week for stuff..  Getting a girlfriend had also proven difficult as I'm getting fucked and alienated here.  I am dying for some pussy, I'm not a eunuch and all.  I was preparing to make a real pathetic bastard of myself and start degrading and begging, it works.  All you have to do is make a pathetic fuck of yourself and a you will steal a woman's heart\n\nYou see all these people sympathize with the hapless, all people do is insult me.  I've been through some pretty sick and sadistic torment over the years. I've recovered from herniated discs, gout, food poisoning, unimaginably agonizing pain. Then people's Idle threats, mostly, the death threats after my identity was compromised.  I was compromised a few years ago, people have threatened me in town, my home, at work.  It's been quite an awfully stressful experience but it's been worse.  \n\nI've had some psychotic episodes over the years as well, been doing good about two years now.  A few people wanted me committed, over this and scaring the shit out of people in a berserker rage a few times.  I haven't hurt anyone, people have to understand, the psychotic episodes were aggravated.  I'm not one to resort to violence believe you me.  \n\nMy shenanigans are supposed to be in good humor amid the pain &amp; suffering in this world, I to struggle with this world.  I needed help and none of these Gods or Demons or Angels or Fomorians or whatever these things call themselves really seemed to want to help.  They wanted me to be killed or shut up mostly, some of these folks are like, evil as fuck.  For a lack of a better term, I've done my best not to whip up some smear job on the scandals and felonies and crimes some of these sick fucks got away with.  Like I had previously mentioned, in my aetheral blog postings that come and go, these individuals are like escaped psychopaths in their own realm, I guess.  These realms as well did not want to cross or be exposed, the request to remain neutral or as indirect as possible makes me aggravated as well.\n\nThey continue to berate and insult me, or the become affectionate and try and apologize, it's like lima syndrome.  The police had been involved a few times, these individuals, demons or gods, were sick, deranged psychopaths.  They managed to go unapprehended to the best of my knowledge.  I wasn't trying to get all involved with the police. Re-Enlistment is looking sketchy there, I've done everything I can to get back in the Army and it's just proving an obstacle between people fucking me.  I ended up a bit compromised in this anyway and things look kind of fucked.\n\nAs I went on to try and relate all my views comparatively with myth and religion, I see people just wanting to re-affirm their dogma's.  Things hadn't been to bad in those experiences. I was growing more wary of people insulting my intelligence or argument over some alternative piece of history I presented that may or may not be true.  I had only began to mettle with conspiracy theories and the subs there on reddit.  Reddit just became a great resource of social networking and forum.  God damn it's an amazing website, it may be nothing more than a den of trolls, but it's got more resources than you can imagine.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMay write more later,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 62106, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Talking more about how I'm not delusional", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572035007, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dgzqc0/talking_more_about_how_im_not_delusional/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Reiki108", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4oexsjs5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570907958, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dgzkgh/free_reiki_sessions_for_tomorrow_sunday_monday_20/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dgzkgh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dgzkgh/free_reiki_sessions_for_tomorrow_sunday_monday_20/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570907959, "score": 1, "selftext": "Good morning everyone, I hope you are all doing well.

My name is Anna, I am 17 years old and I'm from Europe. Living in France. \n\nI have had mental health issues and symptoms since my early years of childhood, and got help for them as a younger teenager. I am officially out of being interned in psychiatrics units after around 4 years on and off including a 2 and a half period non stop. \n\nI have come back to my old environment, and although it has changed and the people in it are so loving and helpful. I can't deal with the past trauma any longer and I need out. I have gotten very... Suicidal and at risk of harming myself but hospital doesn't seem a viable option for me as I feel the pain of others very strongly and tend to feel worse after a ponctual hospitalisation.\n\nI have thought about investing some time into a spiritual retreat as I know they have associative (free/cheap) retreats but I don't know about age restriction and I'm not prepared to go further than this country nor the countries that surround it. \n\nDoes anybody have experience like this? I am obviously not asking for a life saving answer but any insight into possibilities around my area would be helpful. \n\nKind comments are always welcome obviously as well.\n\nThank you so much for reading through, \nWishing you all the best.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 62099, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Mental healing", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572034368, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dgz1u2/mental_healing/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "YT_Wisdom", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ju3bx8p", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570902623, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dgyf1z/alan_watts_silent_mind_rich_life/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dgyf1z", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dgyf1z/alan_watts_silent_mind_rich_life/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570902624, "score": 3, "selftext": "[https://youtu.be/\\_Bp9n3fr0I4](https://youtu.be/_Bp9n3fr0I4) \\- Mental silence that is a mind which is highly alert and highly aware without talking to itself all the time", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 62093, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Alan Watts | Silent Mind = Rich Life", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572033752, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dgyf1z/alan_watts_silent_mind_rich_life/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Astraalove", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4qzitqc0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570902384, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dgyd5u/signs_youve_experienced_ego_death_imho/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dgyd5u", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 43, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dgyd5u/signs_youve_experienced_ego_death_imho/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570902385, "score": 105, "selftext": "1.

I wanted to talk about NDE's (Near Death Experience's) and how some people have bad experience's in them. Some people say that they witness hell or see other variations of what they think is hell. Like complete blackness, people suffering and other strange things, but after some thought I've come to an idea that may give some in sight in those bad experience's. \n\n\nThis is an idea that I came to realize back in 2016. I think that those experience's are spiritual hallucination's. I believe what is happening is that the physical body maybe causing these problems. The physical body is still alive. In the living world we spend time worrying and struggling with life issues. As we live these problems become deeper in grained in us. Almost as if developing our personality and beliefs. Dictating our actions and emotions. A dream to me is like a safe mini NDE. When we fall a sleep we have dreams about our anxieties, fears, and desires that we have when we are awake. The reason why we have dreams at all is because the spirit and body are interwoven as we live our lives on earth. As we sleep the spirit receives those living thoughts and is almost forced to live out those concepts and ideas in the dreams which is our living obligations and so on. This is what is happening in a bad near death experience. Since the body just died there is still faint neurological and physical energy flowing inside. \n\n\nThis is the only way a NDE can work. Because the spirit and body are still quantumly connected. This causes the spirit to be stuck between two worlds experiencing the living and the dead. So the message that the after life wants to give you is being disrupted with the physical mind and body. Its almost like two different people arguing. In a NDE you temporally separate into two parts. One is the real you (spirit) and the other is the old you. This old you (body dying on the ground) is still in that mode of struggling, worrying and fearing. It send's these old anxieties and fears to the spirit as it try's to receive the message from the after life. So the massage becomes mixed and distorted. \n\n\nIf you believed in hell and the cliches of the bible then you will have these subconsciously inserted in you NDE. Its like a bad dream, but its occurring during the process of dying. When you fully die. Meaning the body completely dies. These bad experiences will dissipate into nothing. Because the spirit is released from old obligations (living body..life). Only in real death can you full see the reality of the after life. With no boundaries from the living world. So it's the body and the physical mind causing these bad experiences in NDE's. Your old self giving you a bad dream.. even while dying! ;) So there is nothing to fear. I believe there's no hell as I explained. There maybe a bad experience that we may have to go through before we fully die, but its all caused by the dying body, but will not last long and before we know it we will be in a nice hammock relaxing with our deceased relatives. So to speak ;)\n This is just my theories and ideas from research. \n\nP. S - I think that the spirits in the after life know this and used this NDE to give us messages to improve our lives. So when we return to life we can make changes and help others.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 62034, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why We Have Negative NDEs!", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572029413, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dgtqko/why_we_have_negative_ndes/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Nuit11", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_al0wd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570874552, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dgt6pi/researching_egyptian_rosetta_stone_cyrilic_and/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dgt6pi", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dgt6pi/researching_egyptian_rosetta_stone_cyrilic_and/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570874553, "score": 0, "selftext": " [Script of Neolithic Shamans](http://artof4elements.com/entry/259/script-of-neolithic-shamans)\n\nLearning from the Egyptian Rosetta Stone and Christian Orthodox Icons\n\n## Researching Rosetta Stone, and Cyrilic from Ancient Egyptian to Slavic Spiritual Wisdom\n\n## [Symbols and Signs](http://artof4elements.com/entry/34/symbols-signs)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n### Worshiping Sha, Ancient Egyptian and Slavic Mystical Knowledge of the first alphabets\n\n## Learning from Rosetta Stone about How Sh was replaced by M and W\n\nKnowing all to be a vibration, while paying the deepest respect to sounds of each and every sacred letter, we find 22 consonants, in use 4,000 years ago.

I went through all 66 books in the bible to check to see which ones had a chapter 2 that ended in line 22 if any. There were 5, they all had good meaning, but what's important is that the first book and last book to have a chapter 2 ending in line 22, were directly connected \"coincidentally\" the first book is proverbs its 2:22  says : the treacherous will be uprooted from the land, and the wicked will be torn from it..upon reading that I had a memory flash back of a man saying that the people who are pieces of shit basically are going to be transported to other places where the same control, and negative shit will be allowed to occur, so that was comforting. What I thought was crazy was that the last book to have a 2:22 was 2 Peter 2:22 it says: of them the proverbs are true, a dog will swallow its vomit and a pig will return to the mud. So the first book is a \"prophecy/prediction\" and the last books,first line, confirms that by saying the proverbs are true.. holy cheese and crackers eh. Further more if you count the 22 word from the beginning of proverbs it is the word HELP followed by them understand. This checks out in every bible I looked this up in. Also what gets a little strange is that i believe if this were to happen it would be in the year 2022, \"coincidentally\" in 2022 i will be 33 years old same year jesus left/died.

I always have a strong connection to French countryside. She never speaks a word but I understand her every thought. At the beginning, she gave me a rose and a small piece of paper saying \"Everything happens for a reason\". She held my hands and smiled. Then she held me and it felt like warmest embrace I have ever had. \n\nI started to get emotional and constantly apologised to her for everything - the hatred towards myself, the pain I put us both through, everything. She smiled and I know she said everything will be okay. We held hands, kissed, danced. Then she took me to the lavender field where I collapsed in relief and peace. \n\nBefore i left I promised to love and cherish her and that means to love and cherish myself.

She is in excruciating pain, and doctors don\u2019t have a diagnosis as to why. Seeing her like this has been incredibly hard for me and my family. Doctors have told us that she\u2019s on borrowed time, but we expected her death to come days ago, but she\u2019s still living on in extreme pain. Some times when we are visiting her, she doesn\u2019t seem all \u201chere.\u201d What I mean is, sometimes we think she\u2019s talking to people on the other side. For example, she\u2019ll be screaming in pain one second, and then say \u201coh, it looks so beautiful, Ken, hi!\u201d (Ken is her deceased husband). She says comments like this one with a big smile on her face before she snaps back to reality and cries out in pain. My question is, is there a way to help her move on to the other side? She has whispered that she doesn\u2019t want to die like this, and is afraid of the pain. I don\u2019t know if that would hinder her moving on. She also expressed that she wants to say sorry to her sister. Her sister flew in from Florida yesterday, and they\u2019ve talked briefly (as much as my grandmother can), so we feel as if that wish has been granted. Any advice?

It's a place of hearth, a place of home and familiarity.  Long ago, thousands of years ago, the Kingdom was dominate on the Earth.  I do not know if Earth itself of Yggdrasil or Midgard.  The realms are hard to decipher, if the North was Asgard, Jotunheim, the South was Midgard, so to the East, I do not know.  \n\nI do not know, but I see the Norse culture all over this world, before a cataclysm.  Like the deluge?  But, who would believe in such a thing?  The Norse culture seemed to be the dominant culture all over the world for a time, before the cataclysm, like the deluge?  I do not know if Noah's Ark is true, yet, it may be. I do not know if he saved every last animal.  Nor do I see it as a complete global catastrophe, it was cataclysmic, people survived though....  It seemed like a cataclysmic , earthquake, flood, yet, many bodies survived.  I am not sure what happened, a meteor hit the Earth some say, the ice shelved broke, the Earth liquified before your feet.\n\nBefore this cataclysm the Old Norse Kingdom was much more like the romanticised visions of the Norse Kingdom and culture.  This was thousands of years ago and only time may provide evidence.  Back then, there was relative peace, as far as I can tell.  \n\nVallhall may have existed this time on Earth, I do not know now.  Not an entirely spiritual realm or metaphor in good morale and comradery.  Valhall is something only a warrior could dream of.  To some, to many, it is a place of horror.  The morale of soldiers these days, these days, many of them do not need superstition.  I wasn't one to personally fill the heads of warriors with bullshit to fight.  Such things had been presented amid my delusions.  A warrior shouldn't need superstition to commit to battle.  Nor do I find closure in superstition or hope and prayers.  In emergencies I may call on to the Lord as we all.  \n\nSubjugating soldiers these days by their superstitions or delusions is becoming routine.  I'm not trying to outwit the board of psychology or medicine.  Do I personally need promise of grandeur?  The Halls of Valhall are no place of grandeur.  It's not full of virgins and milk maidens.  It's a place where Kings and the finest warriors may go to the Lord, to continue.  Such beliefs go on around the world, give or take the virgin girls...  The virgin girls, I would tell you to kiss my ass...  I would have to believe in what you were doing despite the virgins.  \n\nBack in my day, in my memory, at least, we had the Krieg Spiel...  Completely arranged battles, every man agreed to bare steel on one another.  Men, with good morale, took to completely arranged battlefield in arranged battles by Brother Kings.  It was later deemed an atrocity and is something that went into the shade of history... The Kriegsspiel....  Complete animals, slaughtering each other in unbridled bloodshed... And the Victors went on to be Legends and Commanders.  \n\nThese days, things aren't the same with our senses of humanity.  Morale is shit, pay is better, benefits are better... You may get some sweet new robotic limbs, a new synthetic face... Later we could hope of new flesh, maybe some virgins.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGod bless them girls.  I've been told I'd fill you with bullshit ideologies.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm humble now though, I am not the biggest, baddest, mother fucker, on the planet.  I'm stark, yet, ill bred, riddled with birth defects.  A mongrel in most cases, I've dealt with being called a mongrel, ill bred, white trash, my whole life.  I'm 6'1ft tall, 250lbs, 220lbs in lean shape.  Athletes these days are showing us human potential.  I am not there, I am relatively average in most directions.  I am not god like in any means... My energy is good, my body is handicapped.  I am dealing with being constantly put down in the shadow of other athletes and warriors.  My time to prove myself to the world may have past.  I'm not an ultra runner, gymnast, or olympian bodybuilder.  I'm willing, able and hungry in all senses.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61981, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Valhall", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572023100, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dgnr2b/valhall/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "PeaceBringer333", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4renk9uq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570839533, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dgnomg/music_movies_and_video_games/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dgnomg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 21, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dgnomg/music_movies_and_video_games/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570839534, "score": 2, "selftext": "Today I have listened to some music which makes me feel different than the usual music.

I've gone on about some of my turmoil dealing with spirituality and reincarnation. I try to have a good sense of humor about things. Here in the west with modern views and no blasphemy laws religion has become a complete mockery to many of us. On top of the torrential blood, death and pain and suffering in this world I find myself disgusted trying to reason with religion myself.\n\nI have a macabre sense of humor but I still have some humanity. It's not really funny at all and we digress into realizing we're just warped individuals. Monty Python's could make the Inquisition a komiker, I'm not at that skill level yet. I have had experiences in this world that make it hard to simply dismiss the paranormal as delusion or superstitions as well. I'm not someone that would promote religion or dogma's this day in age or ever to my knowledge. Words simply aren't enough to compensate for all the pain, suffering and hope with all this superstitions and dogma's people try to find closure in. I see the world news everyday too, it keeps me centered. The feeling of being powerless in a world with so much indoctrination is hard to work with. I seemed to had been singled out by a few organizations.\n\nAs far as I can tell part of myth was true and part of monotheism was true. However, these things were all created thousands of years ago to the best of my knowledge. None of the dogma seems to have been updated in the last century or so, so I have no idea and wasn't trying to demonize one supernatural being over another.\n\nIn my experiences, one organization or another didn't want me to alienate their beliefs. I too was trying to be somewhat diplomatic in my creating my own views. Monotheism would be something with the strongest foundation. I hearth back to the Old Norse Kingdoms, the old world, Hellas. Monotheism may have been created over numerous coups occurring throughout the old kingdoms to this day. We did not see history and wars occuring over coups throughout history here in the US anyway.\n\nThe dogma's however aren't entirely tangible, nor do I think things or people were represented correctly. Nor am I certain what exactly they call themselves - Angels, Demons, Aesir, Vanir - etc. Their names, entitlements, these are things that would help me sound more educated. So many people thought I was just some dumb American idiot, I'll spare a rant about the bigotry.\n\nLike Jesus, which some argue was from the Nobility from Europe or Scandinavia and others argue he was an Arab or Kemet Jew from Nazareth. I would let the individual speak for himself, I do not know if I am Jesus. Over time I started to think Jesus was a pseudonym for Zeus, yet, none of the scripture made Christ out to sound like the mighty Oak. Or that he was referring to Zeus, not himself, so he was teaching people about Zeus, who some also worship as YHWH. Zeus being represented as the God of monotheism.\n\nJesus though, this individual and his family had been subjected to some of the most sickening atrocities in history amid all the war and bloodshed and murder of his followers. It's not something I can reason with, people are animals. The extent of what sick fucks some of these individuals had been throughout history, degenerates or Demons, is something that can mortify you. I do not personally care what one worships or believes in and believe in separation of church and state. My modern views conflict with all of the insanity dogma and superstition had brought on, on top of people just being complete sicko's.\n\nMy Judaism is weak, I've never even cracked open the Torah or read the Kabbalah. I am not a scholar on religion, I've only briefly studied it. These accounts more or less all became sick and deranged fabrications of something loosely based on what may have even been true created by sick and deranged evil Demons or stoned monks. Not to disrespect the amount of devotion and bloodshed involved in creating these religions, the scribes or Saints. It's just sickening people can make lite of the atrocities that transpired over these beliefs.\n\nMoving on from there Israel was one or two instances of what may be part of the re-incarnation/ death and resurrection myth. These beings re-incarnate or may be immortal, in one place or another, and become legends at time. I mean, In my visions I re-incarnated all over the world. I didn't want worship or power, I seemed like an ambassador, or like the Pope, before these wars started, more or less.\n\nThe \"Demons\" were like escaped loonies and they're just not easy to catch, apparently. I don't know much, with no evidence or a convincing explanation I am unable to humor people, I am insane. That and assassination, I wasn't trying to go public or profit or anything, I'm just trying to deal with social needs and feedback on this insanity. I mentioned having crossed paths with numerous people over the years that told me I was the reincarnation of Zeus. I didn't think I was Zeus, I am not the biggest, baddest mother fucker on the planet that can slay Dragons, he's out there though.\n\nHowever, I do not care what or who people worship as long as they're not murderin or making blood sacrifices. You can give these things all the milk and cookies you want. Nor am I appointing myself the real Messiah at this time. I needed some help going to the Vatican, where I can also get assassinated, with some loose leaf updates on the Lord. Here or there, anywhere, anytime, I'm just enjoying the high life until we erupt into WW3, I'll see you in the trenches, boys.\n\nNot knowing the truth but only having vague glimpses of alternate history hasn't got me very far. History, there's a bunch of bullshit in there I was shunned for calling out. The others that I have met that may know anything remotely true either don't care or just want to kill humanity off.\n\nSo stay vigilant! Remember Genocide awareness!\n\nCheers\n\nEdit:\n\nI don't know what's going on with our White Knight, Our Hero, St.Michael. I pray he hadn't sided with the Arch Demons in is out in the bush with a high powered rifle. Machugna... Don't burn me at the stake, it sucks bad. Or any other means of cruel dispatch. Machugna.\n\nI only prayed to the Lord in emergencies and my only request was to be reborn in Sweden, not Mogidishu or some shit. Hopefully there I will be properly bred with golden locks once again and continue my shenanigans over there as an MP in the Swedish Army or successful merc and this nightmare will be over.

My questions are what is actually happening to me that allows me to exp these things? Is it my 3rd eye ? Or what. Why does it seem like I hardly have  the free will to think what I want ? Is this something to try to control or something you just have to surrender too and see what happens. Am i allowed to have a goal in mind ?

I've gone on about some of my turmoil dealing with spirituality and reincarnation.  I try to have a good sense of humor about things.  Here in the west with modern views and no blasphemy laws religion has become a complete mockery to many of us.  On top of the torrential blood, death and pain and suffering in this world I find myself disgusted trying to reason with religion myself. \n\nI have a macabre sense of humor but I still have some humanity.  It's not really funny at all and we digress into realizing we're just warped individuals.  Monty Pythons could make the Inquisition a komiker, I'm not at that skill level yet.  I have had experiences in this world that make it hard to simply dismiss the paranormal as delusion or superstitions as well.  I'm not someone that would promote religion or dogma's this day in age or ever to my knowledge.   Words simply aren't enough to compensate for all the pain, suffering and hope with all this superstitions and dogma's people try to find closure in.  I see the world news everyday too, it keeps me centered. The feeling of being powerless in a world with so much indoctrination is hard to work with.  I seemed to had been singled out by a few organizations.  \n\nAs far as I can tell part of myth was true and part of monotheism was true.  However, these things were all created thousands of years ago to the best of my knoweldge.  None of the dogma seems to have been updated in the last century or so, so I have no idea and wasn't trying to demonize one super natural being over another.  \n\nIn my experiences, one organization or another didn't want me to alienate their beliefs.  I too was trying to be somewhat diplomatic in my creating my own views.  Monotheism would be something with the strongest foundation.  I hearth back to the Old Norse Kingdoms, the old world, Hellas.  Monotheism may have been created over numerous coups occuring throughout the old kingdoms to this day.  We did not see history and wars occuring over coups thoughout history here in the US anyway.  \n\nThe dogma's however aren't entirely tangible, nor do I think things or people were represented correctly. Nor am I certain what exactly they call themselves - Angels, Demons, Aesir, Vanir - etc.  Their names, entitlements, these are things that would help me sound more educated.  So many people thought I was just some dumb American idiot, I'll spare a rant about the bigotry.\n\n Like Jesus, which some argue was from the Nobility from Europe or Scandinavia and others argue he was an Arab or Kemet Jew from Nazareth.  I would let the individual speak for himself, I do not know if I am Jesus.   Over time I started to think Jesus was a pseudonym for  Zeus, yet, none of the scripture made Christ out to sound like the mighty Oak.  Or that he was refering to Zeus, not himself, so he was teaching people about Zeus, who some also worship as YHWH. Zeus being represented as the God of monotheism.\n\nJesus though, this individual and his family had been subjected to some of the most sickening atrocities in history amid all the war and bloodshed and murder of his followers.  It's not something I can reason with, people are animals.  The extent of what sick fucks some of these individuals had been throughout history, degenerates or Demons, is something that can mortify you.\n\n My Judaism is weak, I've never even cracked open the Torah or read the Kabbalah. I am not a scholar on religion, I've only briefly studied it.  These accounts more or less all became sick and deranged fabrications of something loosely based on what may have even been true created by sick and deranged evil Demons or stoned monks.  Not to disrespect the amount of devotion and bloodshed involved in creating these religions, the scribes or Saints.  It's just sickening people can make lite of the atrocities that transpired over these beliefs.  \n\nMoving on from there Israel was one or two instances of what may be part of the re-incarnation/ death and resurrection myth.  These beings re-incarnate or may be immortal, in one place or another, and become legends at time. I mean, In my visions I re-incarnated all over the world.  I didn't want worship or power, I seemed like an ambassador, or like the Pope, before these wars started, more or less.   \n\nThe \"Demons\" were like escaped loonies and they're just not easy to catch, appearently.  I don't know much, with no evidence or a convincing explenation I am unable to humor people, I am insane. That and assassination, I wasn't trying to go public or profit or anything, I'm just trying to deal with social needs and feedback on this insanity.  I mentioned havning crossed paths with numerous people over the years that told me I was the re-incarnation of Zeus.  I didn't think I was Zeus, I am not the biggest, baddest mother fucker on the planet that can slay Dragons.\n\n \n\nHowever, I do not care what or who people worship as long as they're not murderin or making blood sacrifices.  You can give these things all the milk and cookies you want.  Nor am I appointing myself the real Messiah at this time.  I needed some help going to the Vatican, where I can also get assassinated, with some loose leaf updates on the Lord.  Here or there, anywhere, anytime, I'm just enjoying the high life until we erupt into WW3, I'll see you in the trenches, boys.\n\nNot knowing the truth but only having vague glimpses of alternate history hasn't got me very far.

Those feelings tend to seem like essences of what is being perceived. They feel like a sort of energy, making the world around me seem more vibrant, and forming the basis of most enjoyment of the present moment when I'm simply being and observing without thinking. This seems like a very different source of pleasure than thoughts associated with the concept of self. It definitely seems thoughts can suppress these feelings, but also other factors affect them. Changes in those feelings can cause huge changes in how I experience reality, even though everything looks the same in a purely objective way.\n\nI've almost never seen other people discuss this phenomenon. So, I don't really know what to call it. Beauty is the most appropriate label I can think of. Framed that way, I'm saying that in a good state I see more beauty, so even mundane everyday settings can seem very beautiful.\n\nTogether with more positive feelings associated with perception, there also seems to be more positive thoughts and motivations. It's like there is an increase in a sort of energy in my mind which drives those positive phenomena. Once again I wonder how to precisely label this. The best label I can think of is love. I'm saying I experience more love when in a better state.\n\nMany times I've wondered if there is some religious or spiritual phenomenon involved here. I've thought that maybe when I'm feeling more beauty and love I'm closer to God. On a few occasions I freaked out when I saw an unprecedented decline in these things, thinking God has rejected me. I framed some of these ideas in ways inspired by Christianity and Catholicism, which tended to freak me out more.\n\nI've also wondered if maybe the feelings associated with perception are the \"vibrational energy\" which New Age talks about, and the state of perceiving more beauty and love is a \"higher vibrational level\".\n\nMaybe it's something purely psychological, like variations in mood or my amount of dissociation.

I want to share a past life experience that I recently had and also ask a question regarding Dolores Cannon.   \n\n\nI'll start out with my most recent experience.   \n\n\nI was having a conversation with my wife about meditation, specifically about how there are certain energy points on the earth that the spirit has naturally manifested and how these points can be beneficial for anyone during meditation or any spiritual practice. As I'm telling this to her I subconsciously say \"yeah we used to do this back in Egypt\". At that moment my physical reality dissolved and I was transported to a life I had in Egypt. My soul was bombarded with images and feelings at the same time.  I saw myself working at a temple using my hands to heal other souls and at a time were spirituality was common sense and the way of life. I was devoted to the spirit. I couldn't stop crying. I finally understood the pyramids but more than anything I finally understood myself and why i am the way that i am in present. I feel like I gave my entire being in that life for the betterment of not only all the souls in front of me but for the whole collective consciousness. I realized that I grew resentment in my heart from that experience because of what we have done here. I now feel ready to let go of that resentment and give myself fully in this life like I did back then. I discovered many other things during the experience but one of the most interesting one was the fact that I cut a straight line on the palm of my hand in order to mark myself and remember throughout incarnations. I am now certain that marks/scars and physical traits carry over with your record throughout incarnations. Also throughout all my life I have always been very close with the material of Edgar Cayce and after my experience I looked at his readings regarding the history of Egypt and i'll just say that it is on point with what i lived and in a way it was another confirmation for me.  \n\n\nSo this brings me to the question regarding Dolores Cannon. After my experience I began to look for more information regarding past lives and stumbled upon her work.  A lot of her material resonates with me and I was really happy to find her but my confusion is that if all her work and her intention were for the betterment of humanity why didn't she share her actual methods with the world? All i can find is people selling the sessions at a high cost or an online course to learn her methods at an even higher cost. \n\nI understand we all have our own unique way of seeing life but it's hard for me to comprehend how one could discover something so beneficial for the world yet not fully contribute it so that we can all learn it. I know that what Cayce did was different since he was the one using his body and soul as the vehicle to obtain the material but he still shared to the best of his ability how we can all get there.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61917, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Past Life experience and Dolores Cannon QHHT", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570893340, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dgglwt/past_life_experience_and_dolores_cannon_qhht/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "sanmartin333", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4qatsrhn", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570805683, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dggbj0/morning_ritual_become_a_productive_and_successful/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dggbj0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dggbj0/morning_ritual_become_a_productive_and_successful/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570805684, "score": 1, "selftext": "[https://twitter.com/TheBestDeals9/status/1182655206938566656?s=20](https://twitter.com/TheBestDeals9/status/1182655206938566656?s=20)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61912, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Morning Ritual: Become a Productive and Successful Entrepreneur with a Morning Routine", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570892074, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dggbj0/morning_ritual_become_a_productive_and_successful/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Adkore", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4e2zo1da", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570803079, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dgfqny/16_and_broke_free/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dgfqny", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dgfqny/16_and_broke_free/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570803081, "score": 66, "selftext": "I\u2019m tired of faking everything, everyone around me is blind and programmed but it\u2019s ok.

Liberation involves getting free from the concept of material life; in spiritual life the same distinction is there, the same individuality is there, but in pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should not misunderstand that the word vi\u015bate, \"enters into Me,\" supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous with the impersonal Brahman. No. Vi\u015bate means that one can enter into the abode of the Supreme Lord in his individuality to engage in His association and render service unto Him. For instance, a green bird enters a green tree not to become one with the tree but to enjoy the fruits of the tree. Impersonalists generally give the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging. This may be a source of happiness for the impersonalist, but the personalist keeps his personal individuality like an aquatic in the ocean. We find so many living entities within the ocean, if we go deep. Surface acquaintance with the ocean is not sufficient; one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in the ocean depths.\n\nBecause of his pure devotional service, a devotee can understand the transcendental qualities and the opulences of the Supreme Lord in truth. As it is stated in the Eleventh Chapter, only by devotional service can one understand. The same is confirmed here; one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devotional service and enter into His kingdom.\n\nAfter attainment of the brahma-bh\u016bta stage of freedom from material conceptions, devotional service begins by one's hearing about the Lord. When one hears about the Supreme Lord, automatically the brahma-bh\u016bta stage develops, and material contamination-greediness and lust for sense enjoyment-disappears. As lust and desires disappear from the heart of a devotee, he becomes more attached to the service of the Lord, and by such attachment he becomes free from material contamination. In that state of life he can understand the Supreme Lord. This is the statement of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also. Also after liberation the process of bhakti or transcendental service continues. The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra confirms this: \u0101pr\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101t tatr\u0101pi hi d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dam. This means that after liberation the process of devotional service continues. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, real devotional liberation is defined as the reinstatement of the living entity in his own identity, his own constitutional position. The constitutional position is already explained: every living entity is the part and parcel fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord. Therefore his constitutional position is to serve. After liberation, this service is never stopped. Actual liberation is getting free from misconceptions of life.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the significance of the word vi\u015bate ? What example has been given in the verse to explain the same ?**\n\n**Question 2 : What is the constitutional position of a living entity ? What references from the Vedic literature have been given to explain its nature after liberation ?**\n\n[Picture : Bhagavad-gita 18.55](https://gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/55)", "send_replies": true,

This was a powerful experience.In the experience, I realised the clarity from the fleeting moment or I realised the moment itself . My body was realizing the newness of every moment (What Alan Watts calls letting go precisely), far different from the cycles of the mind we live in.That experience came and went just like experiences do.\n\nNow I am thinking, and instinctively contemplating the present moment while living in the moment. Counterproductive maybe but it's definitely counterintuitive.\n\n Intellectually all beings live in the moment because we cannot physically live in the past or the future. So  Either we are the moment or the moment is us, we'll never know.(Because we cannot be inside a system and know it from the outside right?!). \nAs such I say this is a terrifying experience for me because of the power that this moment holds over the mind. Power to liberate us perhaps,Yeahh?!... Personally Speaking, I have sought via thoughts for a long time now. I have a possessive controlling mind that wants to understand everything. But now How can I expect to possess or understand the moment from the mind. I can't, it's not possible. Idk what triggered this last night but right now I am not able to dissolve the mind and experience every moment as new. Am back to a cycle of the mind.\nMy best guess, I have been practicing turning inward for a long time,combined with another practice of being subtly present, keeping my mind present here with the body (only a couple days of practice with this). Plus curiosity and a longing for liberation. I must have been practicing one of this, that triggered the experience. I can't recall which was it but as I'm trying more often, maybe I'll find something more permanent, that is If i don't lose myself first.\n\nYou know what, I can, I still can get into the state, I can break the wheel of the mind but till now whenever I do try, I meet my fears\ud83d\ude01. I have tried a lot of times since morning now and that state change is a dangerous area. And it's a dangerous area because my mind cannot understand it and the mind gets scared. For example the last I tried, I got scared from the state change, and moreover I came directly to writing this post, because I felt a hint of derealization this time. It was a momentary thing; as soon as I felt the change (my mind perceived the change as derealizing or maybe it just got scared of the vastness of the moment) and I straight went back into the comfortable thoughts cycles of the mind. The fear of derealization really got to me that moment. Mind scared of not, I can't dismiss the possibility that maybe I was derealizing and was saved. (atleast this was my first instict at the time). As I'm writing this, everything's making a bit more sense, but It will never fully make sense. For god's sake I have been depersonalized for over 1.5 years (trauma) but now am forced to ask myself;  Was I derealised all these 2-3 years and now I'm realising, or am I realised like any normal human being but not fully concious of the moment , and seeking this experience can actually result in derealization. My mind is boggled on this issue. \n\n\nI have this tendency wherein that which I fear, definitely manifests. I have been depersonalized for more than an year now and this past month, things were looking better after a long traumatic history of drug use, depression, and real traumas. I was healing and I felt personalizing at the very least and then this experience happened and everything's changed. My mental concepts, my intellect rendered useless. All that's left is the constant reminder of the fleeting moment, and somehow in trying to keep in touch with this moment, I feel I'll lose myself. It's been one day and this is so overwhelming to my entire system. In this one day I have lost the way I used to live wherein I never cared for the moment,  and the only way left is to live in the moment and I don't know how to do that. Last night it happened, I didn't do it. It's like they say, I had created the atmosphere for it to happen. Wish I hadn't. I'm overwhelming myself by being overly concious of the present moment.\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nMy insight:\nI have been seeking from the mind from my thoughts whereas what I really seek is the mind itself . \nSo from my understanding Seeking the moment or seeking the mind is the same thing. (I have made this conclusion referring to my Buddhist ideology of the mind which includes awareness and not just thoughts; So my experience of the everflowing moments is a part of the mind{without any thinking,as if thoughts aren't a part of this state of mind and cannot exist}. This was a direct straight experience to why Buddhist say that the mind existed before my physical body and will after it is gone; Another thing that makes sense now is the art of letting go. I was just automatically letting go. Mind you, I wasnt intellectually aware that I was letting go. In fact In such an experience, either everything is intelligence or nothing is intelligence but there's definitely no separate thoughtful intellect.)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61873, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "(Crisis) An experiential realisation of the present moment.

Something in me told me to give my boredom over to God because If I allow myself to satisfy my own boredom, then it will lead to me either hurting myself or others either directly or indirectly. So after I had this thought and gave my heartfelt desire to God, he led me down the hallways of my dormitory. I walked with vigor and full awareness that I was called to walk down this hallway, but I didn't know what would be ahead of me. As I finally get close to some elevators something in me told me to stop and look in the trash can by the elevators. Naturally, my human instinct kicked in and I felt a little unsure and grossed out as to why God would want me to look into the trashcan, but a thought came to mind that the janitors just changed out all the trashcans and went about their cleaning routine as they usually do every morning at around this time. After convincing myself that all was well with the trashcan, I then peered into it with an intense stare that I have felt before communicating with God in some way. I peered into the trashcan and to my surprise I saw a big zip-locked bag of homemade chocolate chip Macadamia Nut cookies with pieces of Oreos. I am typing this as I am eating these cookies and feel so loved right now and feeling like God is super chill and like maybe that's how he wants us when we call out to him. Any thoughts? I just wanted to mention that I've been struggling immensely with boredom and I find that it's all too easy to start drama or feel better about myself by looking to social media.

Human social structures are a \u201chigher level\u201d of mind - this is not meant to denote superiority, but rather to show its dependence on lower levels of organization. You cannot have the society \u201csupermind\u201d without individual minds. Each level of mind has its own drive, but ultimately they are all concerned with their own persistence. In order for this societal mind to exist, it requires each of its components to continue towards society\u2019s goal of growth. This means that each individual is \u2018programmed\u2019 to see themselves as a part of the larger mind, but not a free acting mind. \n\nAwareness is the root of consciousness. When we become aware of something, we bring it into our \u201cconscious reality\u201d. Society survives by controlling the awareness of each of its component minds, allowing only those aspects of the universe which help its growth to enter an individual\u2019s \u201creality\u201d. The western world has understood this and accepted it as a sort of nihilism - we are only convinced of meaning because of our societal mind. As an analogy, we can say that these nihilists see society as a simulation, making things real which aren\u2019t really there. In this analogy, I propose we instead see society as a lens - it cannot create anything which is not already there, but only focus our attention. \n\nThis lens is so powerful that many of us become convinced that nothing exists in the background; there is only the object focused in the foreground of our consciousness. However, some of us catch glimpses of something out of focus, and begin to question it. We are slightly aware of something beyond what has been shown to us.\n\nContinuing the analogy further, an \u201cawakening\u201d is the moment that an individual mind takes off its societal lens completely. No more focusing of consciousness, just pure perception of everything happening. In this moment we realize that the significance of existence comes not from what we do with it, but that it *is. Being* is the most powerful fact in the universe, and we are part of that fact. Reality is not of our creation, but we are the creation of reality. \n\nI would like to term this \u201cultimate reality\u201d, whereas we are normally only aware of \u201ccurated reality\u201d (curated by the mind of society). This ultimate reality consumes everything, it is all powerful an inescapable. The significance of this realization is that it uproots all the claims of the societal mind. It tells us that we are *free*, that strength doesn\u2019t come from our actions, that love and suffering are absolute. \n\nNow, imagine for a moment that the super-mind of society could collectively come to this realization. That\u2019s what the idea of \u201cone tribe\u201d represents. A unity in a simple fact: existence. There is no division, only one collective which we all participate in. \n\nAs long as we perceive our existence as being a *means to an end*, instead of the means *and* the end, we\u2019ll be convinced that we need more for ourselves. The truth is, there is nothing more. This is it: and it is Everything.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61721, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The thing which holds you back", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570812158, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dg0pjd/the_thing_which_holds_you_back/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "nitanshu-kamble94", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_pc5iy6x", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570725403, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dg0mfh/tarot_reading_and_how_it_works/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dg0mfh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dg0mfh/tarot_reading_and_how_it_works/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570725407, "score": 1, "selftext": "Why Tarot readings are so much on point?\n\nIs it because it says the things which we want to hear or does it actually help?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61721, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Tarot reading and how it works?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570811794, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dg0mfh/tarot_reading_and_how_it_works/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mayallurbaconburn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2pacmha0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570725228, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dg0kxk/ok_sorry_i_know_i_just_posted_a_long_one_but/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dg0kxk", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dg0kxk/ok_sorry_i_know_i_just_posted_a_long_one_but/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570725229, "score": 0, "selftext": "Please I\u2019m begging y\u2019all to BEG God not to let me fall out of the spirit right now, for the spirit to do whatever it has to do to break me and turn me inside out right now to hold on and to really find and get a grip on Jesus Christ.. my prayer this morning has been crush me, fill me, keep the portal open..

He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.**\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nTo the impersonalist, achieving the brahma-bh\u016bta stage, becoming one with the Absolute, is the last word. But for the personalist, or pure devotee, one has to go still further to become engaged in pure devotional service. This means that one who is engaged in pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord is already in a state of liberation, called brahma-bh\u016bta, oneness with the Absolute. Without being one with the Supreme, the Absolute, one cannot render service unto Him. In the absolute conception, there is no difference between the served and the servitor; yet the distinction is there, in a higher spiritual sense.\n\nIn the material concept of life, when one works for sense gratification, there is misery, but in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure devotional service, there is no misery. The devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has nothing to lament or desire. Since God is full, a living entity who is engaged in God's service, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, becomes also full in himself. He is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure devotee has no thought other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is naturally always joyful. He does not lament for any material loss or gain because he is full in service of the Lord. He has no desire for material enjoyment because he knows that every living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore eternally a servant. He does not see, in the material world, someone as higher and someone as lower; higher and lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee has nothing to do with ephemeral appearances or disappearances. For him stone and gold are of equal value. This is the brahma-bh\u016bta stage, and this stage is attained very easily by the pure devotee. In that stage of existence, the idea of becoming one with the Supreme Brahman and annihilating one's individuality becomes hellish, and the idea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes phantasmagoria, and the senses are like broken serpents' teeth. As there is no fear of a serpent with broken teeth, so there is no fear from the senses when they are automatically controlled. The world is miserable for the materially infected person, but for a devotee the entire world is as good as Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, or the spiritual sky. The highest personality in this material universe is no more significant than an ant for a devotee.

I work in retail and have for almost 2 years. I never intended on staying in a retail job for very long, however going with the flow of things helped me learn a lot. \n\nI'm at the point now where I know that I definately don't want to be in retail forever. I'm entering my 20's now and, from my understanding, this is when a loy of people start to put a little more shape on their path or career. \n\nThe one thing i do enjoy about retail, specifically hardware stores, is being able to help people. When a customer comes in with a problem and I help them find a solution, or give them just the right part, the expression on some people's face is that of happiness and thanks. It's a good feeling to be able to help someone. \n\nI want to do more for people. I want to effectively help people who need it, or generally make some good, in a more direct and larger way. I think the phrase \"be the change you want to see\" just clicked with me.\n\nSorry this is long, it's 3:29am and this just hit me like an epiphany. I'm hoping that wanting to make a living off of this idea isn't selfish or .. a corruption in my motives(?)\n\n\nP.S. I really don't know how I would or could start to help and make a change.

I've talked about how every little thing is recorded in our life review, but I was also thinking about how it all works and I came up with some strange thoughts that maybe true. \n\nI was thinking about a made up scenario between two people. So in this scenario one person physically hits the other. Well I came to the conclusion that this person that your hitting is feeling the pain that you will experience in your life review at that very moment. That's where I came to believe that we are living our life review as we are living our lives. Its all one mixed experience occurring now. Since you hit that person his is now going to be apart of your you life review. He is feeling his pain, but his is also feeling the pain that you will feel when you pass on. So in a sense at that moment both of you are feeling each others pain. Although he is feeling both of you now. He is getting a seek preview of the pain you will also feel in death. Only in spirit form can we be free to feel more and in this form we can get all of the sensations, emotions from the life we lived in our life review, but I feel that even in our physical form we can do the same. \n\nIts similar to the physics theory of 'Schrodinger's cat'. In this theory he has a cat that is both alive and dead in a box. It has to do with not being able to measure radio active decay. Since we cant measure it. Its both decayed and not decayed. Like the cat we are both alive and dead at the same time. So I would think that we should be aware of this as some of us are and do things that will make us feel good about when we are spirits. While doing those things now we can enjoy them as we live our living lives. Since were living our life review...as we live.  \n\nSo in closing we may have to be very careful on how we really interact with others. Making sure to take in account of another persons emotional and physical state and how we can negatively or positively effect them. Whether\u00a0it be physical\u00a0harm or sexual even.\u00a0 This is from 2017.\n\n I just wanted to share that little bit thanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61656, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "We Are Living Our Life Review As We Live Our Lives..Now", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570773860, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dftqyk/we_are_living_our_life_review_as_we_live_our/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "NsfwOlive", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_hju4j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570687419, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dftqm6/i_am_very_tired_and_i_feel_heavy_inside_what_is/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dftqm6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dftqm6/i_am_very_tired_and_i_feel_heavy_inside_what_is/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570687420, "score": 1, "selftext": "It is like this all day for many years.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61656, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I am very tired, and I feel heavy inside.

Lots of bad things have happened since January, and I feel that I am being beat down by life itself, and he feels the same, so we have been talking our stress out on each other.\n\nI suffer from PTSD, lots of anxiety and have begun having panic attacks again. I'm depressed, always on edge, angry, irritable, etc. My husband and I had taken in my lifelong best friend and her 4 year old so that she could escape her abusive boyfriend, and then we all rented a house together for one year. In the end it completely ruined our friendship.\n\nThe house had so much bad energy in it, and you could frequently hear footsteps even though there was no one. I could feel it hover around me. Have woken to it standing over me in bed, just a man shaped shadow. It had woken both my husband and my friend by chocking them in their sleep.  Things would fall off the counters with no one in that room. I have also seen apparitions twice of a little girl.\n\nWhen we moved into that house, my friend pushed my husband to seek out a different company to work for and he did, leading him to work night shifts (which he did for 3 long years). A month after that, friend began dating the neighbor next door and moved in with him, completely breaking our aggreement. I was alone in this house that scared me so bad, while also caring for a 2 year old, and new born that I had while we lived there, and she would crying a heartbreaking scared panicked cry nonstop. Finally the lease was up and we moved a good distance away just to separate from the house &amp; my exfriend. She then spent the next year telling everyone that she took us in, she paid all of the bills and did all this great stuff when she did not.\n\nNow I have 3 kids, getting pregnant immediately upon moving into our new place. Since having my 3rd, I have been a pit of negativity, anger, and dispare. I have tried so hard to work past it, but I am stuck. \n\nI had my spiritual awakening about 6 months prior to my friend moving in and I was the happiest I had ever been. Living in that house and trying to help my friend has had a long lasting affect on me and I just cannot seem to let go.\n\nAnyways, I have finally come to be ready to get into the spiritual work again and get myself sorted out and reconnected again. \n\nI would really like to go have a Reiki session but have no idea how to find someone.  I have had reiki done on me while in rehab for the last time and I believe it was a huge factor in bring able to finally kick the drug.\n\nBesides that, I need recommendations on what to do to get my peace and love back. It is extremely difficult to do anything for myself due to having 3 kids (5,3, and 2 yr). I recently discovered ritual baths and I am making it my place to relax and meditate after 5 years of not.\n\nI need healing. I don't understand why I am struggling so much. So much time has passed and it feels so raw. I have not being a good example to my kids, for I have poor emotional control sometimes.\n\nI just want to stop feeling like everyday is this huge struggle to get through. Therapy is not an option due to time constraints and it has always left me feeling worse.\n\nI love crystals and herbs and have researched and use them frequently. They were put away one we moved to our current house and just recently began using them again. I have come to find that my close friend that died has taken on position of my spirit guide, and now have too. \n\nPlease give me some advice or direct me to the right place. I wake up angery more  days than not. I am in my senior year of my BA in psychology  with classes on my husbands days off, and he worked 9a-11 pm, so it is difficult to do much. My youngest 2 are a handful\n\nSorry that was so long. I could write a book. I carry so much depression, anxiety and the weight of PTSD and I really need to take back my control. \n\nHow do I find someone to do reikie? How else can I cleanze and rejuvenate my soul? Are there groups out there for likeminded people? Yogo?.\n\nI don't know what I want. I just know I don't want to feel like this anymore.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61657, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I need something so I can heal.

I cant figure out whats wrong with me, but its like I cant stand social interaction. As soon as someone starts talking to me I want it to be over. Its not like this all the time with everyone, but most of the time it is. Theres an occasional person here or there that I feel comfortable with, but we never become friends. \n\nBarely anyone thats around me is into spirituality like I am. I feel like I cant be myself around people because they\u2019ll just think I\u2019m crazy or a witch. I just started dorming at college for the first time, and I\u2019m roommates with an old high school friend. I think now, and even in high school, we were really just friends out of convenience. We can be similar in a lot of ways, but in others we are so different. I feel like when I speak, she doesn\u2019t understand where I\u2019m coming from most of the time. Shes a bit judgmental I suppose. And day by day its really starting to get to me. \n\nLets just say, Im someone who needs a lot of alone time. And she is someone who talks a lot. I do try to communicate this, like when shes talking too much I\u2019ll be like \u201coh, I just got an email I should really answer this now.\u201d And she will *keep* talking. Today I just got fed up, and I was just saying \u201cyeah, mhm, yeah\u201d hoping she would get the message. But she never does. And she told me that she feels like she\u2019s the only one ever sharing stuff, and that I need to get more interests. \n\nAt this point I feel like I wanna lose it. But I don\u2019t. I wanted to say that \u201cyou wouldnt like my interests!!!\u201d Because I know she wouldnt, she has said in passing that she doesnt believe in tarot cards or astrology or god or anything I actually believe in and find interesting. \n\nAnyways, the point of me typing this out is that I always seem to be surrounded by people that are not like-minded. I dont know what to do, because when I socialize for more than 3 seconds I just want to get out of there. Does anyone else experience this? I love people, but Its like being around them is too overwhelming. What could be the cause of this? How can I stop it? \n\nEvery day I just wish I could talk to my angels because I feel like they\u2019re the only ones who would understand me. But I cant even communicate with *them*!!!

have recently been doing spiritual baths, and on my last one..Mary came up a lot for me.

Hormones and overwhelming needs and desires to have fornicate.  I had been insulted one way or another, not that I care about these things.  I was insulted sexually or for being a horned sinner and making a tramp of myself on occassion.  \n\nThe animalistic nature of Men at times is horrible.  Men can be bastards or turn into bastards over women regularly. I don't know about women, women are cut throats and shit too, I guess. It is something that should be expected, I guess.  I mean, I've not betrayed a friend in the sense of cheating them over a woman.  I had gone the distance to dominate some of their ex-girlfriends from time to time, it shouldn't be so personal.  I was raised by jaded Men and am a Jaded Man with gratuitous impressions of women.\n\nI am not a eunuch or a limp prick or anything. I have biological needs and some people try to shroud me in religious overtones.  The dogma's aren't something I would have people believe in.  I enjoy promiscuity and the fruits of nature.  It's not as if I wouldn't have a good sense of humor in it all.I was subconsciously prepared for looking like a tramp ages ago.  Making a psychopath and war mongering whore of myself is the least of my concerns, like burning in fucking Hell for fucking up.  \n\nThe extent of being insulted sexually went on into criminal levels.  These girls that were supposedly goddesses went on some profane sexual exploits trying to insult me.  That's their cunt logic, I do not give a shit, why would I.  It was very animalistic and disgusting and amusing, mostly amusing.  The extent some of these people went to try and humiliate and alienate me sexually was expected.  I hadn't singled myself out as a sinner or anything.  I need to sow my oats as we all do.  \n\nIt's bad, folks, I get so anxious it hurts.  I'm weeping, just beating it like a boss.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been hard going into an emotional commitment with a woman over promiscuity.  I'm not settled in one place or another, I certainly don't want to be here and I haven't found a well bred Frau for the Stark Kinder.

I'll whip up my next series of silly papers and get little to no feedback.  I usually just delete posts that get no feedback then people ask me to give them time.  I give a post around 24hrs at the most, after that, it's a failure I need to take care of.  I have a few aliases, my identity kept being compromised, I wasn't delusional.  \n\nThere were people following me, trying to find out my identity, I insulted them for not just trying to talk to me, and they just insulted me.  Anytime I get a beat on these loonies, they just insult me and fade back into the shadows.  It's been a back and forth experience of insulting each other.  These people are  basically insane, I am not delusional, they are real and I have been dealing with them for years.\n\nMoving on, I seemed to have been in an ill mood last night going on about some dark things I was brewing up.  I do lose my composure from time to time and sometimes to not catch myself.  I was talking about butchering people and throwing their body parts in dumpsters, metaphorically, of course. That's public dumping and it's like a double whammy, it's a no go.  Someone suggested any nearby bodies of water...  \n\nI don't know. I can only delve into homicide so far before I get sick to my stomach.  I'm not a real psychopath, it's just something I think about.  I think about these writers and all who write these stories.  Who thinks of some of the filth in the media?  It's not as if I can talk about murdering someone, I just bring you the book later and hope you all enjoy it.  Then the cycle repeats, I'll pump out a few more deranged novels for you to enjoy about hacking up bodies.\n\n I am not one to resort to violence and try to keep it civil.  I may have lost some of you there with the, mess...  I assure you I am an upstanding and law abiding citizen as much as one can be.  I was joking and  I understand how things can be taken out of context there.  I'm generally try to remain Stoic, it's really hard. Sometimes I do not realize I've went off the path into unadulterated carnage.\n\nI get frustrated from time to time but I was really joking, it's not funny.  Homicide, cannibalism, mass murder, not funny, Toms.  My bad, to all of you folk out there I may have shook up amid my poor mood.  I am not struggling, I do get frustrated with some people's outrageous insults to me that I do not deserve.  On the internet, I tend to take things lightly, it was supposed to be no Man's land.  A place where we could all let it hang out and act like jackasses and psychopaths.  Things have changed over the years and I am from a previous generation, I'll work on reforming my behaviour on the internet.  \n\nMoving on once more, I often go over my spiritual and religious views.  I go back and forth trying to compensate or cover some key points I was trying to talk about.  When I'm posting online, it's usually subjects I want to talk about.  I tend to lose people in dottery multiple topics, in humorous posting, or satire.  In the States we do not have blasphemy laws.  I am not one to disrespect other people's views or commit heresy or sacrilege to offense.  I'm just a funny man, I thought it would be hilarious - besides the possibility of being gratuitously murdered.\n\nI mean, people take things seriously on different levels, religion in particular. Or their atheists, or atheists posing as one religious demographic or another.  I do not understand why people weren't amused with my long con's regardarding re-incarnation and being a deity, or supposed Deity.  Then things started getting real in my personal life.  It was something that grew out of hand and was compromising me.  I was joking at first, I had no idea if I was really a deity.  I do not understand why I couldn't humor people, I guess I just suck at comedy.  I wanted to be a funny man, I do have a macabre sense of humor most of the time. \n\nThen I went on to learn there are a bunch of corrupt evil individuals that would despise such things. I was to legit to quit, I mean, I tried to smooth things over with these evil mother fuckers.  They seem to really fucking hate me, before I even offended them.  When things started to get real I just wanted to expose everything in hopes people could learn the truth.  Most people do not seem to care, get hostile and just want their peace of mind.  People are pretty much god damn animals.\n\nIt just puzzles me, it's something I would find amusing to my core.  I mean, I only tried these things on different forums and all, nothing good transpired.  From pagans, atheist to contemporary religious people, military as well, it was duka.  People were just immediately offended or skeptical, and generally insulting.  My views were more or less comparative religion and myth, relating one thing to another.  It was unsuccessful of any of my views really connecting.  Between dogma or bigotry or skepticism, I had been unsuccessful.  \n\nNegativity was something I was prepared for still just let down I could give people the gift of hysterical laughter amid my follies.  With all the pain and suffering in the world I know it's hard.  The dogma's aren't something I wrote or believe in or would have anyone believe in.  I dove balls deep into the 3rd Reich and propaganda, said I do not share these beliefs. I got into a little harry mess over propaganda there.\n\n I am an American Citizen and know Nationalism would just enrage so many people around the world, and in America.  I said I am not a Nazi, Racist, Prejudice or an Oath Breaker or Traitor or bastard son of a bitch in history.  I believe in Democracy, Independence and Liberty and Justice for All, God bless America.  I can't say I would be dead already anywhere else, that's what some floppy bureaucrat would probably say.\n\nThe World Wars are a very traumatizing and sensitive area where there seems to be no God.  It's not something I find funny at all and something only Monty Python's can accomplish in amusing people out there.  How Monty Pythons does it is not something I hadn't come to comprehend.  They're really outrageous and amazing comedians. Their sense of humor I can understand but not quite reach that penchant ability to really amuse some people. \n\nThere were different experiences with learning how much bullshit is going on in religion and all different underlying movements or agenda's and cults, investments, charities.  Later some incidents in my personal life transpired and people were generally just threatening to murder me.  These people can burn in the lake of fire.\n\nOther than that, this is all pretty out of my control. I have no evidence and can't simply tweet the Pope, that angered several people the first time.  I wrote the Holy Seer about homosexuality and marriage, in sarcasm, it was gravely immature and upset a lot of people, I apologize.  There are far more powerful people in this world and people that are capable of lying, cheating, stealing, killing, and utter disgrace in accomplishing their goals.  \n\nMy integrity in life had gotten me little to nowhere.

I was mostly playing video games, chatting with my online friends, and wasn't driven to improve my skills for work. I was mildly depressed, and the only productive activity I was able to keep up with was to go for a run every 2-3 days.  \nJust about 2 weeks ago, I officially quit gaming and never went back. I explained to my friends I needed a break, so they left me alone. Since then I've been concentrating better on job search and other ongoing projects that I've received from my network. Things are slowly improving, but I'm not quite at where I want yet still I still need a full-time job.  \n\n\n**Then this happened, what does it mean?**  \nJust two days ago on October 7th around 3:14 pm, I was I just standing in the kitchen, chewing on bread, candidly staring out of the kitchen window, feeling the warm sunlight on me, and thinking about absolutely nothing. I noticed something fluttering, and found a sulfur color butterfly struggling to find an exit. My first thought was how did it get inside since all my windows have a mesh screen in front of it. I couldn't find a way to get it out since it's blocked. I didn't think to catch it with my hands because I was afraid to hurt it, so I left it there.  \n   \nThe next day, I found it dead and still next to the window. I was feeling sad and regretful that I didn't do anything to help it. I gently took it off the window ledge, laid it on a wet paper towel, and now I have it refrigerated in a container. I'm thinking about preserving it with resin tomorrow.   \n\n\n**My question is, I found the butterfly alive, and then I found it dead the next day, what's the message here?**", "send_replies": true,

town and work/live at a hostel. My hometown is an hour away, and I recently got rid of my car because I will be traveling with my partner, so I can\u2019t stay at home for a bit or find a new job in my hometown for the next month till I go. I cannot find another job in this town because they do not offer staff accommodation and I would be homeless. The hostel I work at has only four employees including the manager. The manager is an alcoholic, and often makes fun of me for stupid things along with the fact that i\u2019m sober. My other coworker has ganged up with him and scapegoated me. They make fun of me because of how i made my bed (it\u2019s MY and my partners bed, it was made just fine, it doesn\u2019t have to be hostel standards whatsoever). They jab at me any chance I get. They claim i\u2019m not social enough, but when I speak, they\u2019re mean. My partner knows these two individuals pretty good as well, and also sees them everyday and hangs out with one of them. \n\nI confided with my partner today about how my older male coworkers treated me. (i\u2019m 21f, my partner is 23f). I\u2019ve been doing yoga and being a lot more active to get my mind off what I have to deal with everyday- as i\u2019m a spiritual person and I know that the confidence to not let them bother me starts within myself. Simply, before when confiding in her, she would say \u201cdon\u2019t manifest more of it for yourself\u201d, so I would be afraid to bring things up to her because she would say i\u2019m manifesting it even more by talking about it. I told her recently that this does not help me, and it makes me hesitant to bring up things I should be able to confide to my partner about. Today, I tried bringing up the rude things they said and did to me earlier this morning, and she kept stating \u201cit all starts within you\u201d... Which she already knows that I know, hence my yoga and things i\u2019ve been doing daily the past couple weeks to combat it. Confidence doesn\u2019t come naturally to me, and she knows this. I\u2019ve been working on it, but of course it won\u2019t happen overnight, and for the record, I have been feeling better, but not enough to totally combat my coworkers\u2019 actions and words. I told her I\u2019m looking for her to give me the reassurance that i\u2019m doing a good job, because it\u2019s nice to hear from a loved one, and not just from myself, because sometimes i doubt myself. She got mad at me and told me I was trying to argue with her when I nicely told her that I already know that it\u2019s within myself, hence my past actions lately, and the fact that we have had conversations about it lately. \n\nI don\u2019t know, am I the one to blame here with a possible martyr complex? I was just trying to let her know by saying \u201cdon\u2019t manifest that\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s all within you\u201d does not help when i\u2019m trying to vent because i already try my absolute hardest to practice those mantras.

Then I'm in Kohl's and hear a woman behind talking about a baby Aspen's first birthday. This is where it gets really weird, a couple nights later I watched my first Tarot Card video. The question was \"Who is my spirit guide?\". I knew to pick group 2 and it came back as \"future child, just dropping in.\" I kid you notttttt, just as I'm watching the video the Pizza guy answers the door and tells me and my mom that our order was almost sent to Aspen Drive.

Over the last 5 years, I\u2019ve lost my spiritual path and most of the extra abilities with it, or it\u2019s a lot easier to ignore now.\n\nAbout 6 months ago, I started seeing triple or quadruple digits all day, every day. My clock will be 4:44 or 11:11 or street numbers or ticket number\u2026again, multiple times a day\u2026every day for 6 months. At first I brushed it off but by my 3rd month in, I started to feel anxious about a message I felt like was attempting to be conveyed. It has progressively gotten more frequent (started at 1 or 2 a day\u2026now it\u2019s at least 5 times a day). Then, last night, I received two e-mails in the middle of the night from my mom (who also has been told she has extra abilities) which was very unlike her (plus she typically texts me). I opened them and there was no subject, no content\u2026just an e-mail. I text her this morning asking why she was e-mailing me in the middle of the night and to tell her nothing came through. She said she didn\u2019t e-mail me, then looked and sure enough\u2026she has sent e-mails to me. Her phone was plugged in and in the kitchen all night! So now, even more than before, I feel like something is trying to convey something to me and getting increasingly as frustrated with me and I am with not understanding the message. \n\nYears in the past, I\u2019ve always received auditory messages\u2026regardless of resistance. But I\u2019ve never had something nagging at me this long. So, at the risk of sounding like a complete crazy person, I thought perhaps someone out there may have experienced something similar or can point me in a direction on how to access it.

But essentially that it wasn't supposed to happen that way.\n\nI guess before this I had never given thought to the potential that things could divert from the way they're supposed to - absent a decision like suicide made by the person themselves - that, I understand, is an interruption in the plan.  To put it another way, I was under the impression that there was some level of agreement between our souls prior to this life, and something unexpected like this couldn't happen to break that agreement.   \n\nHas anyone read differently, or have different understanding?  Like I said, I'm still learning and trying to put all of these new concepts (that appear to be repeating themselves) together in a way that they fit for me.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61528, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Question about soul contracts and breaking them", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570715501, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dfhc7q/question_about_soul_contracts_and_breaking_them/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Cizzy-Shizzy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4pt0znya", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570628229, "crosspost_parent": "t3_dcowq0", "crosspost_parent_list": [{"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "approved_at_utc": null, "approved_by": null, "archived": false, "author": "Cizzy-Shizzy", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4pt0znya", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "banned_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "category": null, "clicked": false, "content_categories": null, "contest_mode": false, "created": 1570126786.0, "created_utc": 1570097986.0, "discussion_type": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.awakened", "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "id": "dcowq0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "likes": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#0079d3", "link_flair_css_class": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2dc347ec-45b5-11e8-b349-0efa33e75a28", "link_flair_text": "Sharing/Anecdote", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media": null, "media_embed": {}, "media_only": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_dcowq0", "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 1, "num_reports": null, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/awakened/comments/dcowq0/spiritual_awakening_what_to_do_afterwards_when_it/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "quarantine": false, "removal_reason": null, "report_reasons": null, "saved": false, "score": 1, "secure_media": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "\nI am currently undergoing what I believe to be a spiritual awakening and I would love to speak to someone knowledgeable about the experience, who could also possibly help me identify my own abilities when it comes to clairaudience, clairvoyance etc, as I have been hospitalised twice this year already for hearing voices that I personally believe are spiritual.\nI am just a little unsure where to go from here and could do with some advice. Plus I have never had a reading or anything of the like.\n\nI'll fill you in on my background slightly first of all:\n\nI am 32, a Pisces with a Gemini ascendant, I have been married for 12 years (my husband is a Scorpio), and have been able to see what I thought to be spirits my entire life - that, as well as having some eerily prophetic dreams/visions on occasion, seems to be an ability that runs in my Mother's family (she calls it our \"witchy sense\"). I have always perceived spirits to look like a cross between a shadow with a mirage like heat shimmer on the surface, or just warm glowing energy that I can detect by 'feel' and also see move around a room.  I've seen things on and off for years, but the frequency gradually increased with my age. Nothing startling there.\n\nSo, where to start with the oddities that I have been experiencing for over a year now?\n\nLet's begin with hearing voices. I began hearing low murmuring a few years back, as though a tv or radio were on low in another room of the house, or people who lived close by were conversing on their patios. I could make out the occasional word and detect roughly the number of speakers but there was nothing much more to it than that other than thinking we had neighbours who were up all hours of the day and night! Gradually though, the conversations increased until I could hear them clearly inside my house no matter what room I was in, and then voices that spoke directly to me as well, to there being voices in the same room, all around me and next to my ears. This was also when they started discussing me and my life with each other, almost describing a running narrative sometimes, as well as speaking to me about my thoughts, dreams that I might have had (they woke me being too noisy) and about what had happened in my parallel past lives. Discussions with the voices are what led me to research a lot of esoteric and spiritual subjects, Hermetica, etc, which in turn lead to me learning about spiritual awakening. Sometimes my voices are voices of people I know or have known, but others are unrecognisable and have names they go by.\n\nMy eyesight has also been affected (and not just seeing spirits- these I now usually see on a daily basis and in slightly differing forms, too, rather than just the two general ways I saw things before). I've been seeing Like greeny tinged shadow figures, and misty entities or little 'daemons' (as my voices call them, or, as one put it nicely once - \"What the f@$k is that?\" Lol). \n\nI should tell you that I do wear glasses for bog standard short sightedness generally, but everything I have described thus far and am about to go into further is all with or without my glasses. My eyes are fine. I experienced double vision when I was about 14 for a few months and had many tests done to figure out the problem. They ended up putting a prism on the back of one of my glasses lenses that straightened everything back up again, as my actual eyeballs were fine and I didn't have a squint, just a very slight stigmatism which wasn't the problem. So yeah, no obvious eye damage or issues after that one time...\n\nBut back to recently. Indoors, I initially thought that my husband had been messing with the computer and the TV when I first started seeing 'oddly'. The eyes on the TV characters changed colour and luminosity during a show, the text I would be reading on the computer was morphing into roughly 5 blurred lines with a lighter font underneath a single solid one as I watched, but the blurry version of the text was in different languages (I can read English, French and German only) that ranged from French, to what looked like an eastern European language, to hieroglyphics, to straight out symbols and sigils that I later realised had massive spiritual meaning, such as the eye of Horus, Metatron's cube, the pentacle, the flower and seed of life, characters from the Enochian alphabet, to just to name a few...and I couldn't understand what was happening.\n\nThings got even weirder when I began to see the TV's odd eye colours on people around me. Vivid bright blue, yellowy gold, golden-red, dark red rimmed with black with black shadowy sockets, completely black but glossy with shadowed sockets again, totally black sunken sockets that looked to have stars drawn on them with makeup that had then started to smudge down on either cheek... It was like someone had superimposed a face over the face of the person I was talking to. Or half of their face. \nI could see more than one pupil, and it wasn't always circular... I still didn't know what the hell was going on and began to think there was something happening that I wasn't being told. \n\nOutdoors, I could see sparkles of light, red, green and blue almost laser-looking streaks that flash past, warm white/light purple orbs, dark red misty fluid shadows, symbols and sigils, sacred geometry and grid lines made up of straight lines, hexagons and also toruses whilst diving around. Buildings and lights and road signs would spiral upwards and grow faintly to double their height. I often experience vertigo because it looks like the world around me has been stretched taller and I am either experiencing it from either above or below. Nowadays my vision can double if I blink hard and make it happen, and I can get amazingly clear acuity of vision sometimes so much so I can see street signs far away clearer than those close by at the same time as seeing everything else normally, save for just a strip of my gaze into the distance (if that makes sense)... almost like a strip of perfectly clear tunnel vision amongst the rest of my normal shortsighted peripheral vision around it. This I usually experience on angles and parallels to where I was standing/driving.... I looked at the moon one night and as I watched it blurred, split and then slowly separated into the seed of life with the mini moons as the circles... Deep purple and blue colours with soft lights everywhere filled the gaps of building sites or between tall buildings, with orange flamed sconces on some walls of some stone buildings. I started to think that seeing these grid lines where the buildings etc appeared bigger and clearer was seeing into another spiritual dimension of what everything looked like there, in the spiritual realm. I would often get overcome by emotions whilst out in the car looking around and burst into tears, as I was struggling to remember things to do with my past/parallel/future lives and seeing those clear lines into somewhere else had a bit of a familiar feeling that went along with them, or even the return of memories.\n\nMy confusion and the voices has gotten me involuntarily hospitalised in a psych ward twice already this year. Schizophrenia and psychosis was mentioned and at the moment I am being injected with an anti-psychotic drug each month for 3 months. I got no answers when I asked about people possibly astral projecting to talk to me and about all the symbolism and geometry I'd been seeing everywhere (they just wanted to focus on the Satanic nature of some of the symbols I'd seen, which I didn't care to discuss as I sounded crazy taken out of context). I was almost ready to agree with them about my experiences just being down to mental illness each time I left the hospital, but there have been a few other big experiences that I've had that couldn't be explained by audio hallucinations...\n\n... The First being that one day, whilst in the shower, I was discussing something with my voices when all of a sudden this incredible deep voice spoke the exact same words at the exact same time as me, and I sounded as though I had two voices in my throat. In case that wasn't enough, later on that night I started speaking in JUST the deep voice to my husband, who was distinctly freaked out because I sounded like a demon out of a movie. I called it my \"fun voice\" and laughed in amazement, glad he'd heard as well as me. \n\nSecondly, I have an uncanny knack for drumming along with songs and music I'm listening to, knowing exactly when to change tempo, when to pause or change up a beat, where to do double time, even trap or heavy metal music which is so hard to preempt guessing a tune to sometimes!! And when to stop and start. I feel a sort of energy Ball in either palm that I spin and whack around....oh, and I should mention, I'm self taught learning the guitar but I CANNOT drum, especially not along in time with bands like Tool, System of A Down or Slipknot, or to classical music etc!! \n\nThirdly, spirits, entities and ghosts touch me!! Physically. They poke and prod me and almost \"tie\" areas of me down in a sort of looping, spiral motion sometimes with energy that felt like air... Oftentimes I'd have what felt like muscle spasms but without the cramp after the twitches, and not really in my muscles, just atop them. My heart has experienced palpations that felt like I had more than on heart beating there in my chest. I had a particularly upsetting dream one night and awoke quite disoriented, only for something to run into my room and HOLD MY HAND!!!! As real and firm as a human grasp, although in my half awakened state I knew definately couldn't be. A large, heavy Tarantula sized spider has walked down my arm before (I am arachnophobic and I certainly won't be forgetting that one anytime soon!) and on one other occasion I was being snuffled and poked and prodded so relentlessly inside my house that I locked myself outside on my upstairs balcony with a blanket and pillow intending to just sleep on the tiles, and I just cried and cried and cried because I wanted the touching to stop. It did, eventually, and I came inside then and made my husband spoon me for protection all night long. \n\nSo, I guess with these other weird phenomena happening, I could never put it all down to me just being sick, and especially as since my last hospital stay I have learned about spiritual awakening and all the various signs that you can go through with that... Every checklist or quiz I have looked at I have scored nearly every single thing... But now (as my last anti-psychotic drug injection is due on the 8th) I am anticipating a return to hearing things loudly again once it wears off (no part of my odd sight or seeing sprits was affected by the drug, just my voices being quieted and the touching stopping when I went into hospital). I guess I just want to know, where do we go from here, after awakening to knowing that we are souls in temporary housing, connected to the Universe and everything in it? What guidance can be given for those of us dealing with hectic occurrences and 'symptoms' of becoming aware afterwards and during, short of having a reading done? And if I were to have a reading done, should I see a medium, a psychic, a Reiki master, a Shaman etc... ??? I have never seen anyone like that before and wouldn't really know where to begin or what to ask. Any advice or help from those of you kind enough to read through my novel-length post and still take me seriously would be appreciated so, so much. I keep seeing 2.20 all the time but I feel so very lost as to where to go from here.\n\nThanks.\n\nCizzy\n\nP.s oh thought I'd mention I often get a soft light bluey whitish light glowing directly under my chin at my throat, as though I were shining a torch upwards to light up my cheeks and neck...

The feeling was similar to being followed or watched. I came to the realization one day that I was dreaming about these experiences and they were coming to pass. Later on in life I found it hard to remember my dreams(they were more vivid in my childhood days) and they slipped away, only for me to be reminded of them as I am living the memory in the present, when this happens I feel as if I'm being shocked our stirred up by some type of force/energy and it gives me goosebumps. These dreams are all in a condensed form, think of it as short 5 to 10 second glimpses in to the future and different ones are appearing/flashing rapidly in my brain.(Similar to subliminal messages). These cycles happen every few years!

For example, I'm extremely positive, happy and I love their company, and I have no inhibitions (mentally challenged people are the only people I can find who are willing to dance on stage in public with me without being drunk). I've come to realize that most of my friends and the people who surround me have been mentally challenged.\n\nBut it get's weirder than that. For years I was telepathically communicating to my extraterrestrial guides and I got into a committed relationship with my ET Soulmate. He kept telling me telepathically that he was capable of becoming people in my reality or influencing them. One day I asked him to meet me somewhere to prove it, and he did, but the guy that showed up there and introduced himself to me never told me it was him, so I never suspected him, and we became best friends. I thought he was gay, mentally challenged and the least spiritual person in the world, but then around March he revealed to me that he was straight, that he was my soulmate that I had been telepathically communicating to for years and that he had just been acting mentally challenged that whole time, but what was more shocking is that he proved to me that he could read my mind, he told me a lot of ET information ET's had told me over the years, and he said he was an Undercover ET Agent, and another shocking thing he revealed to me was that he was multiple people in my reality (or was controlling multiple people in my reality). I have written all of this out in length and it's a long story so if you want to read it let me know and I can email it to you. \n\nLong story short, he kept telling me he didn't want me falling in love with him in that form, because it wasn't his real body. I didn't believe it and fell in love with him anyway, so he broke up with me. \n\nThere were numerous WEIRD occasions where it seemed like he was other people in my reality that made me think he was telling the truth about that. He also told me he was the same person as my previous best friend and ALL of my exes. \n\nI can't claim to understand it, but I witnessed him start talking like them, taking on their mannerisms and saying things they said to me in the past that he couldn't have known (and I wasn't thinking of those things either so it's not like he read my mind either), it was like he literally became them sometimes. He told me it was similar to the Vulcan Mind Meld Technique. \n\nPlus he continues to tell me telepathically that I am being monitored, that my whole reality is staged, and that he is the people in my reality. That is why I continue to be paranoid that he is other people in my reality.\n\nWell, maybe it's just a weird coincidence or synchronicity, but after he broke up with me, I really missed him and wished I could meet another guy just like him, and this other guy came along, who is exactly like him. \n\nThe thing is I'm still skeptical and doubtful, but I can't explain any of this logically.\n\nI knew my friend wasn't truly mentally challenged ever since he revealed to me that he had been lying to me and acting the whole time, but I missed the old him - his fake personality, the one I had befriended in the first place. I had so much fun with him back in the day when he was acting mentally challenged. We would do the weirdest things, like dance randomly in public to music on our phones. He was so fun to hang out with, I miss those good old days.\n\nBut this new guy who suddenly appeared, is exactly like him and either that has manifested via the Law of Attraction, or it is true that my ET soulmate is able to become various people in my life. It's so weird because they have the same mannerisms, facial expressions, body language, interests, they both have perfect posture, are super fast, fit and athletic, and this new guy came up to me outside and put a song on his phone and started dancing EXACTLY like what he used to do and I never thought I'd meet another person who liked dancing randomly in public like me ever again. \n\nEither way this situation is really Fing with me. You have to remember I didn't mean to fall in love with him, but it happened, and I fell for him hard. And sometimes when we would go out in public, he'd still act mentally challenged, and during this time frame I became so unconditionally loving I just didn't care what anyone thought of me. I truly didn't care anymore if people thought I was dating a mentally challenged guy. \n\nBut it was worse than that, because I knew he was just acting and he was an undercover agent that I didn't even know really, but I was in such denial that I just wanted to hang onto what we used to have. I ended up falling in love with his fake personality too and that really hurt. \n\nEventually I began thinking that I WANTED him to be mentally challenged, and that I would love to date a mentally challenged guy. I didn't much care for his real personality, he was such a dick. But when he was acting like a mentally challenged guy, he was so nice. \n\nSo now that I've met this other mentally challenged guy who is exactly like him, I am extremely cautious, because the truth is I am really into him because I truly do feel like he is my soulmate, and right from the start, this mentally challenged guy has been asking me out. Because he is exactly what I want in a guy. I believe he is my soulmate. i just don't want to F things up. \n\nBut at the same time, logically, I'm just like WTF IS HAPPENING TO ME????? Why am I falling in love with mentally challenged guys???? My parents are going to look at me weird, the whole city is going to wonder wtf is wrong with me! Hell, even I am wondering wtf is wrong with me. I've been hanging out with this guy, and all the other mentally challenged people he hangs out with, and I'm pretty sure the facilitator/supervisor thinks I'm also mentally challenged now. And the thing is, I am quite enjoying it and having fun with them. I love spending time with them, so why should I care what other people think? Yet, I am also quite concerned for my sanity. Because I honestly keep worrying that maybe I've gone absolutely insane, and maybe I am mentally challenged and that's why I am attracted to them so much. \n\nIt just sounds so INSANE and ABSURD to even tell people that aliens told me they are disguising their agents as mentally challenged people. That also seems kind of offensive to me!!!!! Why would they be pretending to be mentally challenged????? They tell me it's because no one would expect them, so really it is the best disguise. But still! \n\nAnd don't ask me why they go to such extreme lengths to blend in and create fake personalities and lives, that would mean even my friends family would have had to be in on it too? I don't know if that was his real name or real family but I don't think it was, because this one time, I overheard him talking on the phone to his fake mom, and he said, \"But I care about you because you've been my mom for many years now\". \n\nWhy is the universe F'ing with me so much?? But this new guy apparently has a big family in town, and he said his cousins are working all over the place, and that makes me feel even more insane, because if I truly was to believe he's an undercover agent, then wouldn't all of his fake relatives also be in on it? \n\nLike most people, I find it highly unlikely! BUT the thing is most people would have thought it was highly unlikely what went down between my friend and I too, but that really happened for real and there were many instances where it truly seemed like he was other people in my reality or was at least able to control them somehow. \n\nSo is he my ET soulmate AGAIN F'ing with me? Because if so, I don't want to end up heartbroken like I did last time. Maybe this is another lesson (they keep telling me I'm being tested). I don't know what to do anymore.\n\nAnd I don't think I'm insane, because I keep doubting all of this, I just can't explain ANY of it, and believe me, I've gone and told this to so many people and none of them have been able to give me a logical explanation, and I have gone to therapy before and my psychologist even said I wasn't crazy. \n\nBut this new guy has not revealed anything unordinary at all, so perhaps it is just the law of attraction, but even then that doesn't make sense, because WHY am I attracting mentally challenged people??????\n\nYou see, that's what I'm confused about. \n\nFor the longest time, I was always trying to understand my relationship with my mentally challenged friend. I was always trying to analyse why I had attracted him into my life, because I do believe that we attract all people into our lives for a reason, and we're only able to keep relationships with those who vibrate at similar frequencies to us. So it was always a mystery to me, since back then, I thought he was the least spiritual person in the world and I was extremely spiritually gifted (I was like, why on earth would I be attracting this weird mentally challenged guy who speaks gibberish all the time and who can't even hold a serious discussion and who isn't spiritual at all?) I tried to see if he was mirroring me at all, but the majority of the time he was testing me instead. He constantly did things that pissed me off back in the day. He taught me patience and unconditional love. But we did have similarities - we both were positive, happy, sober, healthy and loved to dance. \n\nBut then once I found out he was MORE spiritually gifted than I was, I was like OH NOW IT MAKES SENSE, this guy IS vibrating at the same frequency as me, in fact we've been telepathically communicating together for years. He WAS my soulmate. And all this time, I didn't think he was, I just thought he was some weird mentally challenged guy.\n\nBut even if these mentally challenged people in my life (there are others) are all undercover agents, then why have they chosen those personalities? Like.... obviously there's still got to be a lesson in there for me? Becaue I know my ET Soulmate and he doesn't do anything without there being some kind of hidden lesson or meaning to it, it's not just random.

They used to  appear EVERYWHERE. It was truly magical and it's been months, probably a  year since I've seen a sign. (I'd see them back in 2018 HUGE  SYNCHRONICITIES, but even before that,there was always a period of time  where I wouldn't  receive any AT ALL.)  I haven't seen anything, not  even a crumb, If I did see a number that I thought meant something for  example, 557, I would see it once and many others that were misses along  with it. Like, ,553,554, 556 558, 559. (It soon brought out the skeptic  in me, but I'm on the fence about it because I would see 1111 and 1111  only, a ridiculous amount of times!)  Sometimes these numbers would show  up ALL THE TIME, so much so, that the 557 never even showed up, it  would show up once a day, then I'd be bombarded with for example, 556  and all the other ones. This would happen with many other numbers, a  reason why I never took them as signs.\n\nOne  sign that CONSTANTLY shows up, whenever I am thinking about an area of  manifestation is descending numbers. I shouldn't have really said that I  see no signs, that is untrue because I often see 321, 654, 765, 8765,  987, 1098, 543, and basically ANY descending number when thinking in  terms of manifesting in one specific area. It only happens in that area  and whenever i am thinking about manifesting that thing, It ALWAYS shows  up, with absolutely no fail, EVER!!! It largely discourages me from  trying to manifest in that area and I feel prompted to go in and ask,  why?, So I remember, back in 2018, late 2018, I started to meditate,  (bear in mind, I saw huge synchronicities in may of 2018 pointing to  something I wanted to manifest and then they just stopped, I saw  absolutely nothing!)\n\nI also want  to say, that whenever I would ask for signs, I would get nothing, I  would let go, I would detach, I would be in the moment and still,  nothing, so at that point, I was absolutely convinced that something was  calling me to reach within and find the answers.\n\nWell,  I started to meditate and not 4 days later, I had some pretty mind  blowing things happen. This was not in meditation, It was after I had  meditated (my probably 3rd day, I went into deep meditations). As i was  falling asleep, I was watching a spiritual video, now there was a  diagram like thing on the screen, I was completely unaware of this, but  while I was falling asleep with my eyes closed, something happened.  Something was going on in my mind, It was as if ( and I felt this!) I  was drawing a circle interconnected to another circle, well, I freak out  and jump up. It's like that feeling you get when you're about to fall. I  open my eyes, and there on the screen (I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP.) was  what the man in the video, was calling vescica piscis. (the diagram  thing, the EXACT thing I drew while I was falling asleep, or felt myself  drawing) The video was never directly about this, nor did I expect it  to be. (I don't remember what exactly it was about, he never mentioned  circles or a diagram either!)\n\nIt's  as if something, someone who had been watching over me or something,  was sending this image into my head at the same time, It had been on the  screen to prove to me that this was REAL! Other experiences I had, were  all when i had fallen asleep. Many times, I felt this intense  happiness, more like peacefulness and sense of knowing. I would get  answers to many questions, just by falling asleep. If a question was on  my mind, It would immediately be answered! It wouldn't even have to be  answered, I just KNEW the answer. Then one time, in early 2019, when I  was meditating, I had this intense experience, where I was flying down a  tunnel of purple-ish blue glitter. It was like a winding path of  sparkles, all around it was darkness. It was like a dream or a vision. I  felt myself, falling/flying and flying FAST! It was SO REAL!!!\n\nNow,  to the the experience I had upon waking up at 3 this morning. I have a  hard time going back to sleep because at 3 in the morning I often find  that I get panic attacks for no reason, then scary thoughts follow, so I  have to get up and do something for about 30 minutes to an hour to go  to sleep. Other than that, I practice calming, mind relaxation  techniques. I was falling back to sleep and simply breathing in and out,  not really intending to meditate, then I hear a voice. At the time , I  was scared and worried about things, the voice said \"Hello, Heather!\".  (I've always wanted and even intended to meet my higher self, speak with  her directly, in particular) Also, I have to mention, that I was just  talking to myself, like I always do to comfort myself.  I was worried,  (don't remember exactly what I had said, I believe I was wondering If my  heater was going to set my room on fire and debating whether or not to  shut it off) I heard her say something like, \"Everything is going to be  okay. Don't worry about it\" In the softest and kindest, most friendliest  voice EVER! It was beautiful actually.\n\nI  do this thing,where I imagine a beautiful and safe place in my head  while breathing, and so I was doing that, I imagined a white victorian  house, with a huge beautiful green garden with pink and purple blooms  and I started to feel safe and my feelings of fear eventually subsided,  this is when I began hearing her voice again. I started to console  myself in my head saying things like, look at this beautiful place!  we're safe! and then the soft, just most beautiful voice, kind of just  responded to those things by confirming them. (I say that instead of  what she actually had said because I'm not too good at remembering it  yet. all I remember is her saying in that moment, something like, yes,  You ARE okay, everything is okay!) I will never forget it! What I want  to know, is was this the voice of my higher self? It must've been, I  felt her there! I believe she was also there in my late 2018 episodes.\n\nAlso,  before this took place I was reassuring myself that my higher self was  watching over me and I was just barely beginnning to fall asleep, then  my ego chimed in, It said in the creepiest voice \" Heaaaatheeeer, SHE'S WATCHING  YOOOOU!\" That freaked me out, but i knew it was my ego playing tricks on  me. The voice had been just as loud as hers, but more in my face and  wanting to scare me.\n\nI really  feel, that maybe, just maybe, my higher self is trying to finally  communicate with me! After all the THOUSAND TIMES (no offense higher  self, I'm only joking! : )) I asked her to. Maybe I just wasn't  listening, maybe she was communicating with me all along and that makes  me SO HAPPY : )!!!\n\nAnyway, guys,  people of the meditation community, what are your thoughts and even  personal experiences with this? Has the same happened to you? How can I  differentiate the voices of the higher self and something else. I know  that when it's just me dreaming or my ego, the voices are quick, they  speak so quick I can't hear them clearly, when It's my higher self, I  can hear her clearly and she talks at a normal pace and so that I can  hear her. She's very humble and gets her point across without having to  shout, I wish I could do that! LOL\n\nAlso,  I know this had to have been real and not me just dreaming,I had just  been falling asleep and when I dream me and the subject in the dream  having a conversation, is all gibberish. It's mostly mixed up words and  they aren't clear at all!\n\nAnyway,\n\nThanks for reading this long post, hope I can get some good advice here.\n\nSome things, I must clear up,\n\nSeraElisabethReina,  Is just a name that I gave my character that I am using for a story,  she's my favorite of all the ones I 've created. My real name is  Heather.\n\nWhen I was falling asleep , while watching that video, I was watching it on a tablet.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61442, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Might I be hearing the voice of my higher self?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570670410, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/df9tda/might_i_be_hearing_the_voice_of_my_higher_self/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "BlueLavaHealing", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ngpzw11", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570582023, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/df9e1m/online_emotional_support_energy_healing_and_more/", "gildings": {}, "id": "df9e1m", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/df9e1m/online_emotional_support_energy_healing_and_more/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570582025, "score": 1, "selftext": "\nBlue Lava \u2022 Healing Network \n\n                  18+\n\nDistance Energy Healing &amp; Support\n\n*Seeking emotional support staff*\n\n\u2022 Group and private support \n\u2022 Community chat with translator for assistance\n\u2022 Media (and music) with listening capabilities for the group or alone\n(YouTube and Spotify) \n\u2022 Distance energy healing via voice, video or text\n\u2022 The Daily Tao - to find your peaces to the puzzle\n\u2022 The Flow - bluelava's personal healing picture and quote database\n\n+Make your own rooms, Dalai Lama twitter feed, bots and more\n\nHere is the invite \n\n  https://discord.gg/HaM7cwy\n\n thank you &lt;3", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61438, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Online emotional support, energy healing and more", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570668410, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/df9e1m/online_emotional_support_energy_healing_and_more/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tarakerr", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3ht8n91r", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570578885, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/df8oqr/tips_that_have_helped_me_stop_negative_thoughts/", "gildings": {}, "id": "df8oqr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/df8oqr/tips_that_have_helped_me_stop_negative_thoughts/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "Fs-4aIxdQVzQbxY-bUW8rJO3rFfYM3AnTm3EfbYnjvM", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/tueYvNqim6P5AwXY_Q426XJztV6CeTlLO_tbr1vYSNM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ee1300c8bcf43201afe3b6421483a2b5f48c6e0", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/tueYvNqim6P5AwXY_Q426XJztV6CeTlLO_tbr1vYSNM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38894971f0c2db7e68a75071b76e4daece9a8a09", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/tueYvNqim6P5AwXY_Q426XJztV6CeTlLO_tbr1vYSNM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18e627e3dcdd185cb46ba459515c8464284d640b", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/tueYvNqim6P5AwXY_Q426XJztV6CeTlLO_tbr1vYSNM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=3684ab9ff42f1842bcdd141b55143d795a6293e8", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1570578887, "score": 1, "selftext": " [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPNeHzYD7A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsPNeHzYD7A)\n\nHey all! Just wanted to share this video in case anyone struggles with negative thoughts - especially if you have that inner critic that says \"You aren't good enough.\" Just a few tips that have helped me SO Much and hope it helps someone else. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\nIf you prefer reading, I've provided the tips below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Delete the Negative Pop Ups\n\nYou know when you\u2019re on a website, minding your own business, and then\n\nall of a sudden these random pop ups appear all over the screen? They\u2019re\n\nusually pretty annoying and you x out of them straight away. Right?\n\nThat\u2019s how I like to think about our negative thoughts. We\u2019re going about our\n\nday, everything is fine, and then negative thoughts pop up out of no where.\n\nAnd we want them gone, so we can get back to what we were doing.\n\nSo what we can do when that happens\u2026 is every time you have a negative\n\nthought, a negative pop up, make it a goal to get rid of them, picture yourself\n\ndeleting the pop up (click on that x), and change the thought to something a bit\n\nmore positive that is true.\n\nFor example\n\nWhen you\u2019re at work and feel like you don\u2019t click well with anyone around you, a\n\nnegative pop up may appear and say \u201cnobody likes me,\u201d change it to no actually..\n\n\u201cthe right people love me\u201d\n\nor\n\nWhen you look in the mirror and tell yourself, \u201cI hate my body.\u201d Instead say no\n\nactually \u201cI\u2019m working on loving my body more and more every day.\u201d\n\nWhen we start to become aware of our negative thoughts, our negative pop ups, and\n\nchange them into positive statements, then we start to form new healthy habits.\n\nBecause right now our negative thoughts come up over and over again-you may\n\nhave even had the same ones for years. And what happens when you do the same\n\nthing over and over again? and it\u2019s become a bad habit. So we\u2019ve just got to learn to\n\nbreak the bad habit it by becoming aware of the negative pop ups, deleting them,\n\nand changing the statement to positive.\n\nThe more you do this the more you\u2019ll improve!\n\nWe\u2019ve just got to train our brain to find the positive over over again until it becomes\n\nthe new habit. And it will happen. If we work at it every single day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next tip is one that is SO SO important and it is used by SO many people around\n\nthe world like you and me AND many celebrities including Michael Phelps, Richard\n\nBranson, Will Smith, Oprah just to name a few and that is to\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Visualize Your Future Self\n\nWhat do you want your future self to look like? If you got rid of all your\n\nnegative thoughts what would you be doing, that you aren\u2019t doing right now?\n\nMaybe you\u2019d start a business, or step into your first salsa class, or make a\n\nnew friend, or ask for a promotion at work? How would you feel? What\n\nwould that look like to you?\n\nWhen you create a vivid mental picture of yourself achieving a goal, it\u2019s called\n\nvisualization.\n\nIt\u2019s when you feel, live and experience in your mind what you want to\n\nhappen, and your mind sees it as a real memory.\n\nWhen we visualize, it helps our brain experience the good and see the good,\n\nso we can be more confident before we actually get into any activity.\n\nFor example,\n\nMaybe you want to start working out at the gym. Visualization would look like:\n\n\"There I am. I\u2019m at the gym killing it. I\u2019m lifting heavy dumbbells feeling the pump in\n\nmy arms, I\u2019m sweating, and I\u2019m so focused on my goal that I don\u2019t care what anyone\n\nelse thinks. I feel GREAT and I\u2019m so Proud that I\u2019m accomplishing such a difficult\n\nworkout.\"\n\nWhen you visualize yourself doing this, you\u2019re more likely to actually want to go to\n\nthe gym, right? Because in your mind, in your memory, you\u2019ve already had a gym\n\nexperience that was good.\n\nOr\n\nThe same as if you\n\nwanted to start a podcast:\n\n\"Oh look! I\u2019m writing another script for my podcast. I\u2019m working from home on my\n\ncouch next to my beloved dog Henry. I\u2019m reading the new reviews and wow. So\n\nmany people are saying such nice things about this podcast. This is amazing. I feel\n\nso excited about where this podcast is going, and I\u2019m proud that I have a business of\n\nmy own.\"\n\nWhen you visualize yourself crushing it on a podcast, you\u2019re more likely to start one\n\nand become successful right? Because you\u2019ve trained your mind to have a positive\n\nexperience.\n\nThe more you use visualization, the more likely you are to achieve your goal.\n\nAnd you can use it for literally anything. If you\u2019re afraid to talk someone, you\n\ncan visualize yourself having a good conversation with that person. If you\u2019re\n\nafraid of flying, you can visualize yourself landing and seeing your best friend\n\nat the airport. If you\u2019re afraid of speaking up at work, you can visualize\n\nyourself speaking with authority and everyone around you is listening.\n\nSo if you find yourself with a negative mindset and you keep telling yourself \u201cI\n\ncan\u2019t\u201d and you\u2019re \u201calways thinking the worst about the future.\u201d\n\nUse this technique. And use it constantly. Especially if there\u2019s that one thing\n\nyou always worry about or think negatively about.\n\nYou can start now by writing a comment below what you\u2019d like your future self to\n\nlook like. If you didn\u2019t have negative thoughts, what would you be doing? After\n\nyou\u2019re done writing, I want you to close your eyes and visualize what you\u2019ve written.\n\nHow do you feel? Who\u2019s there with you? What\u2019s happening around you? Try\n\npracticing this every day and watch your negative thoughts fade away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Surround Yourself with Positivity\n\nWho are you surrounding yourself with? Are you around people who\n\ncomplain all the time? Are you around people who gossip? Are you watching\n\ntv shows that are putting negative thoughts into your head? What kind of\n\nmusic are you listening to? What books are you reading?\n\nIf you\u2019re already in a bad habit of putting yourself down constantly, and then\n\nyou surround yourself with people who are complaining, who criticize you,\n\nwho like to kick you when you\u2019re already down. You\u2019re going to find it even\n\nmore difficult to break your negative thinking patterns.\n\nSame goes for the tv shows you watch. If you have a negative pop up that\n\nsays \u201cno one can ever love me\u201d and tell yourself there\u2019s no way anyone would\n\nwant to be in a serious relationship with you, and you\u2019re always afraid your\n\npartner is going to cheat on you,\n\nAnd then your favorite tv show on Netflix revolves around cheating. It\u2019s not\n\ngoing to help your mindset. It\u2019s going to put you in a downward spiral of\n\nnegative thinking.\n\nWhat you can do instead is surround yourself with positive people, who\n\nencourage you, who don\u2019t gossip and criticize others. Listen to podcasts or\n\nyoutube videos that are encouraging, insightful, uplifting every day. Follow\n\npeople on instagram who post inspirational and motivational content, so that\n\nyou\u2019ve got positive posts when youre scrolling in your newsfeed.\n\nWhat you surround yourself with, who you hang out with, what you\n\nconsume, is 100% going to influence your mindset. Either for the better or\n\nworse.\n\nSo, choose your environment wisely.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61433, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Tips that have Helped Me STOP Negative Thoughts", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570665272, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/df8oqr/tips_that_have_helped_me_stop_negative_thoughts/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ctlynchyo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_z0k6p", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570578294, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/df8jxd/im_so_tired_i_dont_know_when_the_evil_surrounding/", "gildings": {}, "id": "df8jxd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/df8jxd/im_so_tired_i_dont_know_when_the_evil_surrounding/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570578295, "score": 1, "selftext": "The path to oneness is burning my soul in s cleansing fire, but it burns so unrelentingly that I feel too weak to make all the best decisions.

We\u2019re going about our\n\nday, everything is fine, and then negative thoughts pop up out of no where.\n\nAnd we want them gone, so we can get back to what we were doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what we can do when that happens\u2026 is every time you have a negative\n\nthought, a negative pop up, make it a goal to get rid of them, picture yourself\n\ndeleting the pop up (click on that x), and change the thought to something a bit\n\nmore positive that is true.\n\nFor example\n\nWhen you\u2019re at work and feel like you don\u2019t click well with anyone around you, a\n\nnegative pop up may appear and say \u201cnobody likes me,\u201d change it to no actually..\n\n\u201cthe right people love me\u201d\n\nor\n\nWhen you look in the mirror and tell yourself, \u201cI hate my body.\u201d Instead say no\n\nactually \u201cI\u2019m working on loving my body more and more every day.\u201d\n\nWhen we start to become aware of our negative thoughts, our negative pop ups, and\n\nchange them into positive statements, then we start to form new healthy habits.\n\nBecause right now our negative thoughts come up over and over again-you may\n\nhave even had the same ones for years. And what happens when you do the same\n\nthing over and over again? and it\u2019s become a bad habit. So we\u2019ve just got to learn to\n\nbreak the bad habit it by becoming aware of the negative pop ups, deleting them,\n\nand changing the statement to positive.\n\nThe more you do this the more you\u2019ll improve!\n\nWe\u2019ve just got to train our brain to find the positive over over again until it becomes\n\nthe new habit. And it will happen. If we work at it every single day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next tip is one that is SO SO important and it is used by SO many people around\n\nthe world like you and me AND many celebrities including Michael Phelps, Richard\n\nBranson, Will Smith, Oprah just to name a few and that is to\n\n2. Visualize Your Future Self\n\nWhat do you want your future self to look like? If you got rid of all your\n\nnegative thoughts what would you be doing, that you aren\u2019t doing right now?\n\nMaybe you\u2019d start a business, or step into your first salsa class, or make a\n\nnew friend, or ask for a promotion at work? How would you feel? What\n\nwould that look like to you?\n\nWhen you create a vivid mental picture of yourself achieving a goal, it\u2019s called\n\nvisualization.\n\nIt\u2019s when you feel, live and experience in your mind what you want to\n\nhappen, and your mind sees it as a real memory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we visualize, it helps our brain experience the good and see the good,\n\nso we can be more confident before we actually get into any activity.\n\nFor example,\n\nMaybe you want to start working out at the gym. Visualization would look like:\n\n\"There I am. I\u2019m at the gym killing it. I\u2019m lifting heavy dumbbells feeling the pump in\n\nmy arms, I\u2019m sweating, and I\u2019m so focused on my goal that I don\u2019t care what anyone\n\nelse thinks. I feel GREAT and I\u2019m so Proud that I\u2019m accomplishing such a difficult\n\nworkout.\"\n\nWhen you visualize yourself doing this, you\u2019re more likely to actually want to go to\n\nthe gym, right? Because in your mind, in your memory, you\u2019ve already had a gym\n\nexperience that was good.\n\nOr\n\nThe same as if you\n\nwanted to start a podcast:\n\n\"Oh look! I\u2019m writing another script for my podcast. I\u2019m working from home on my\n\ncouch next to my beloved dog Henry. I\u2019m reading the new reviews and wow. So\n\nmany people are saying such nice things about this podcast. This is amazing. I feel\n\nso excited about where this podcast is going, and I\u2019m proud that I have a business of\n\nmy own.\"\n\nWhen you visualize yourself crushing it on a podcast, you\u2019re more likely to start one\n\nand become successful right? Because you\u2019ve trained your mind to have a positive\n\nexperience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe more you use visualization, the more likely you are to achieve your goal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd you can use it for literally anything. If you\u2019re afraid to talk someone, you\n\ncan visualize yourself having a good conversation with that person. If you\u2019re\n\nafraid of flying, you can visualize yourself landing and seeing your best friend\n\nat the airport. If you\u2019re afraid of speaking up at work, you can visualize\n\nyourself speaking with authority and everyone around you is listening.\n\nSo if you find yourself with a negative mindset and you keep telling yourself \u201cI\n\ncan\u2019t\u201d and you\u2019re \u201calways thinking the worst about the future.\u201d\n\nUse this technique. And use it constantly. Especially if there\u2019s that one thing\n\nyou always worry about or think negatively about.\n\nYou can start now by writing a comment below what you\u2019d like your future self to\n\nlook like. If you didn\u2019t have negative thoughts, what would you be doing? After\n\nyou\u2019re done writing, I want you to close your eyes and visualize what you\u2019ve written.\n\nHow do you feel? Who\u2019s there with you? What\u2019s happening around you? Try\n\npracticing this every day and watch your negative thoughts fade away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Surround Yourself with Positivity\n\nWho are you surrounding yourself with? Are you around people who\n\ncomplain all the time? Are you around people who gossip? Are you watching\n\ntv shows that are putting negative thoughts into your head? What kind of\n\nmusic are you listening to? What books are you reading?\n\nIf you\u2019re already in a bad habit of putting yourself down constantly, and then\n\nyou surround yourself with people who are complaining, who criticize you,\n\nwho like to kick you when you\u2019re already down. You\u2019re going to find it even\n\nmore difficult to break your negative thinking patterns.\n\nSame goes for the tv shows you watch. If you have a negative pop up that\n\nsays \u201cno one can ever love me\u201d and tell yourself there\u2019s no way anyone would\n\nwant to be in a serious relationship with you, and you\u2019re always afraid your\n\npartner is going to cheat on you,\n\nAnd then your favorite tv show on Netflix revolves around cheating. It\u2019s not\n\ngoing to help your mindset. It\u2019s going to put you in a downward spiral of\n\nnegative thinking.\n\nWhat you can do instead is surround yourself with positive people, who\n\nencourage you, who don\u2019t gossip and criticize others. Listen to podcasts or\n\nyoutube videos that are encouraging, insightful, uplifting every day. Follow\n\npeople on instagram who post inspirational and motivational content, so that\n\nyou\u2019ve got positive posts when youre scrolling in your newsfeed.\n\nWhat you surround yourself with, who you hang out with, what you\n\nconsume, is 100% going to influence your mindset. Either for the better or\n\nworse.\n\nSo, choose your environment wisely.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61431, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Tips that have Helped me Stop Negative Thoughts", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570663597, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/df8b0i/tips_that_have_helped_me_stop_negative_thoughts/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "pureozium", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3g7jxbaq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570576149, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/df82hp/being_yourself_around_someone_youre_interested_in/", "gildings": {}, "id": "df82hp", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/df82hp/being_yourself_around_someone_youre_interested_in/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570576151, "score": 2, "selftext": "So I'm 20, I'm very mindful of myself and I try to speak with full authenticity.

I've recently become obsessed with cats (my neighbor's cat most specifically) and I felt it may have some larger meaning.\n\nA little background: \n\nI have grown up with cats all my life. Never personally owned one, but all of my extended relatives (cousins/aunts &amp; uncles) have or have had cats. I was never too attached to any of them and actually had a little fear around them due to family using their them to torture me. I grew up loving dogs much more.\n\nThis year however, things have completely flipped. My brother now owns a cat that I met during vacation earlier in the year. I really enjoyed his cat, he's a rambunctious little thing but also very affectionate. He definitely warmed me up a bit but my neighbor's cat, Chai, is what really brought me over the edge. She would stare at me for months from the other side of the fence in my backyard but recently, she's been out walking around now. She now comes up to me when I'm out having a little smoke break. She's very affectionate and loves to be around me, super playful but gentle, and always trying to come inside with me. If i'm out now she'll come over if I call her name. This has only been going on for like a week now but the weirdest thing is that, since I've learned her name, I see it around everywhere. Chai scented candles and other products with centered around it. This is not something I happen to see or come into contact with on a regular basis but now it's very apparent. Also, Chai is constantly on my mind, she calms me and makes me happy and I feel like she knows what I need in any moment. I'm realizing now I just gushed on about this random cat and not really connected it with spirituality at all but there is something about Chai that I feel like is on par with energy I've been feeling lately around karmic completions and being on the brink of profound change.\n\nTIA for any information you can provide!\n\nTL;DR: I'm suddenly obsessed with a Cat that's been sharing it's time and energy with me and wonder if there's any spiritual significance behind this?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61416, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Any anecdotes on Cats and spirituality?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570657282, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/df6syb/any_anecdotes_on_cats_and_spirituality/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LoveWins1997", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_452lb9o0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570570572, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/df6q1z/the_spirit_soul_body_pill_analogy/", "gildings": {}, "id": "df6q1z", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Video"}], "link_flair_template_id": "a73e23e6-841b-11e7-95a2-0ec544fa7318", "link_flair_text": "Video", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/df6q1z/the_spirit_soul_body_pill_analogy/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "Ra9EVru114Bo2zviFn-tzWrFi2P4sOJtz4Ke9pkQwIw", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/rgAYevjM2dpr6y2KZC0cXLSnIRu2u7ymy7dfWsZ9GVM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e09cb7ac0599eb1a5d4882dc08ce40dca6cf281", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/rgAYevjM2dpr6y2KZC0cXLSnIRu2u7ymy7dfWsZ9GVM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d671f64fd87ed89efbbd682bdee891e5a2b56c88", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/rgAYevjM2dpr6y2KZC0cXLSnIRu2u7ymy7dfWsZ9GVM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64e79922d8402798197f7a452617f5a10856c8c7", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/rgAYevjM2dpr6y2KZC0cXLSnIRu2u7ymy7dfWsZ9GVM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=854ac65294c18c70ba4cf8e8a656fb2950a52157", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1570570574, "score": 1, "selftext": "Spirit = the actual stuff in the pill\nSoul = capsule\nBody = pill container\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FlYVAYkIxC4", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61416, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The spirit soul body pill analogy", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570656961, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/df6q1z/the_spirit_soul_body_pill_analogy/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ExtremeEmployee", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4qmp3wyf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570569960, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/df6knk/theres_more_to_life_than_flippin_burgers/", "gildings": {}, "id": "df6knk", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Enlightenment"}], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/df6knk/theres_more_to_life_than_flippin_burgers/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570569963, "score": 0, "selftext": "There's more to life than flippin burgers.  I have had a hard time achieving my goals of being the biggest baddest mother fucker around in military or law enforcement organizations.  I'm not the biggest baddest mother fucker around.  I'm pretty good, my ego was destroyed ages ago.  I had struggled for years working through medical, psyche and in general waves of bullshit trying to accomplish my career goals.  I did almost everything besides beg and brake down and suck dick, quiproquo, they say.  Do you want to flip burgers or deep throat a Sergeant First Class?  After he's had his way with you you're going to flip burgers for the Army.  \n\n Women think they have it bad, I have no idea, I'm not a woman.  I experience constant animosity, dick measuring and frequently foul and animalistic behavior in other Men.  I mean, I am not an arrogant prick, I mean, all the time. I am generally a stoic and respectful person,  I try to practice all them Noble Virtues. \n\nI've cut up with a few people, that's apparently all it takes is to piss of a few people.  I'm not often formerly confronted and am a confrontational person, I have grave problems with passive aggressive people, they are the scum.  I mean, I lose my composure and people get all shook up after fucking with me.  I'm the one that's crazy, apparently, I'm just a psychopath.  \n\nI haven't had enough people formally confront me, they just insult me and insult my intelligence.  I mean, people are often condescending and insulting, I just can't crush them with my hands and throw them in a dumpster.  In the dumpster their asses are gone for good.  You think they take that shit to the processing plant or know what each of those smells are, nope.  Your slaughtered ass is gone straight to the landfill, bitch. Gone fo' good, no fuss, no muss, see you in Hell.\n\nPeople get creative about corpse disposal, they overthink it.  Television, movies, media, romanticising homicide into some overly elaborate scheme of some brainy psychopath.  Over the years I've met a lot of psychopaths and it's apparently not that hard to kill and dispose of people.  Like melting down people in the bathtub, Jesus Christ.  However, I think many of us have eaten part of a person in our local fast food diners, I know I have.  Nothing like the taste of a Man in your steak tips and saute.  What the fuck is wrong with some people, way to complicated for me, what a fucking hassle.\n\nI'm just kidding, folks, just some dark stuff I was brewing up.  I forgot the fun in writing over censorship ages ago. I'm too a victim of the bullshit around censorship that goes on.  People do not know about some of the shit that goes on in censorship even in America.  Some things need to be approved or sanctioned.  I mean, I'm talking about killing someone, that's not something I seem to be able to joke about, without deeply disturbing people.  So I've since knocked off all the cleaning talk.\n\nBack on track here, I was typically going on about spirituality and religion and shit.  I mean, the bigotry, ignorance, bias, fuck it.  I had went through some experiences personally over the years, I was supposedly a deity, I'm the highest ranking authority on the planet, possibly in the entire cosmos.  Me, not some other deity or sick fucking evil Demon, me.  Me, who is not a Demon, to my knowledge... I'm like Chaotic Good with a few fuck ups...  . I apparently opted for this experience, I do not know.  \n\nHere I am trying to humor you, a Man with a god complex.  Which I wasn't judgemental about, people are animals. I am not being literal, me supposedly being a deity was true though, not me being lost in some delusional fantasy. This is some sick fucked up ass fantasy to be lost in, it's mostly a nightmare, it's been worse though.  It became clear there are numerous organization and people that did not care and were more than obliged to ghost me.  Over the last decade I've only come to the conclusion that there is the nature of the status quo in the general population.  Some just live in their bubbles, some do not want to know the truth.  \n\nYou see all these programs and organizations that want to know the truth.  Many people are fine living in their sheltered world, some are faithful to their dogma's.  Other than that there seem to be numerous organizations out on their own agenda's, some short and long term goals.  Genocide, death, mayhem, the 3rd Reich, Global domination.   The truth in what I would have to say was more or less deeply disturbing and depressing even for myself.  That it was only in my perception and I is unverified.  \n\nI didn't judge anyone yet, I was only experiencing all these things and learning these things.  I am under the impression I was being insulted.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRe-Incarnation I tried to explain like insemination, not artificial, my parents are still biological, but I was implanted there by another..  Why these good folks that raised me, I do not know, I am not trying to ruin these nice people any further.  It's so awkward trying to talk about these things.  There's more to it than that though, it's really deep and I couldn't explain it.  The more technical I got the more pissed people got, they want their dump weather Sky God, who's really up there.  \n\nAs far as religion, part of myth and polytheism is true, part of monotheism is true.  None of it is completely true and much of it amounted to nothing more than an atrocity.  I do not have the knowledge to explain how screwed up it all is.  It's like a literal atrocity to anything I would believe or want people to believe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The abolition of slavery and the caste system.  That's something I mentioned previously.  I'm not the teacher, I'm not the historian, I am not an authority.  Regardless of whether or not what I am saying is the truth, facts, I had no evidence to re-enforce anything.  Other than that, there are organization that may want to control the impression of our history, like control people's view on it, their perception.  This is the type of deductive thinking people should have about perception and cultural views.

Many of us have adopted this consumerism mentality that makes us feel as if we need to attain the next best thing to feel better, to feel whole. Many of us are looking for something OUTSIDE of ourselves to feel better INSIDE of ourselves. We need to change this mentality. We must stop chasing. We must understand that we already have everything we NEED. In order to receive wealth you must feel wealthy, in order to receive love from someone else, you must already feel the love within yourself.

I enter the astral plane through meditation and it starts with spiritual music. I'd reccomend anything that gets you feeling transcendent (Buddhist chants, Shpongle, Gregorian chants, etc.).\n\nIf you'd like the short version skip down to where is says SHORT VERSION\n\nThen I meditate on a singular thought that's holding me back from feeling more comfortable. Always remember that the more love or comfort you feel, the closer you are to the astral plane. Then proceed down a single line of thought and work through the emotions holding back your love. I know you're probably thinking \"easier said then done\" but there is a fairly simple formula to working through biases in a few minutes at a time and it goes as follows:\n\n1. Know that when you were born you didn't have this bias. Also know that if you truly knew love with 100% of your being, you'd already be able to see Spirits. \n\n2. Think back to your strongest memory associated to the thing preventing you from understanding more about love. Could be a childhood bully, abusive parent, bad relationship, even a brainfart you had as a toddler when you learned about how to wear pants. Any memory at all.\n\n3. Focus on the memory and project it to the front of your mind (that just means imagine it to be there). Use your current intelligence to relive the scenario as if you were there and correct your learning mistake. If you cannot find the solution after a few trys then that means you might have a bias behind a bias. If this is the case you need to repeat the above steps for your new bias then return to the bias you originally started on. If not please continue on.\n\n4. Okay now is the tricky part, you need to use your newly found solutions to love (I reccomend writing them down) to follow the train of thought that's leading to a stronger connection to the astral plane. The more biases you can work through and keep track of, the more of the astral plane you will see and the easier new lessons will come to you.\n\n5. Read the short version because you'll still need to do that too.\n\n\nSHORT VERSION\nYou have to realize that the spirit world already exists and everyone has the capacity to make it understood. In other words it's pulling you towards it you just have to allow in it's love. Entering the astral plane starts from the manifestation of the imagination. It's easiest to do this by knowing your place on Earth then visualizing your place in the spirit world. Once you feel comfortable with your place in the spirit world (hence all the bias breakthrough lessons), you can explore the astral plane. From there just imagine any place in the spirit world and you'll get a glimpse at what it looks like. The more you do it, the more accurate you'll be able to see that place.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61316, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How to enter the astral plane in 30 minutes or less", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570613494, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dexm6g/how_to_enter_the_astral_plane_in_30_minutes_or/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "NsfwOlive", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_hju4j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570525995, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dexgue/i_feel_like_i_could_help_so_many_people_if_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dexgue", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dexgue/i_feel_like_i_could_help_so_many_people_if_the/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570525996, "score": 4, "selftext": "I feel like I have a lot to contribute, if people sought my company.

I have had this waying on my heart for a while. But I think maybe some action might help take some of the weight off. Really just wanna put it out there for any new and impressionable seekers, the advice of being careful when jumping into deep waters. Be careful and please employ some due consideration with the practices and methods you use. When some proclaims themself to be of high development and insight, think it through and actually examine them. Do their words and actions match? Are their words actually wise or is just rhetorical technique masquerading as wisdom? Do some research.\n\nWhen doing spiritual work we are often deeply internalizing the information we ingest, and one should be aware of that. Consider is this source a source you wish to make part of you and your way of being? What may the consequences be?  You are allowing a teacher direct access to the shaping of your very being, make sure they can be trusted with that power to help shape you into your greatest potential. \n\nGetting on to the topic which sparked me writing this post. At the moment on youtube there is a youtube channel with 887k subscribers called [Actualized.org](https://Actualized.org) which posts self help and spiritual youtube videos. Seems good on the surface. Hidden however within this, his every video fills practically all the checklists for [Mind-control](https://cultinformation.org.uk/question_what-is-mind-control.html). His teaching is fundmentally disturbing yet the way he presents it will make its actual consequences and implications ellude any but the most detailed and critical watcher. Being given out for free, one easily thinks it harmless. Yet any new seeker or innocent person passing by could get wrapped up in this deeply pernicious and harmful teaching that is marketed and presented as totally innocent. This happened to me. Seeing the deception and seeing through the web I would say has been an awakening of its own, a very difficult one. Working to disentangle bad information from the depths of the mind once it has been internalized is not easy, healing and recovery is a long and difficult process. It hurts to have let someone in and then have that faith so brutally betrayed. Even free information has its price I now realize.\n\nHaving come to this realization of trusted teachers manipulation presents a lot of issues to someone dedicated to the spiritual life. Are they lost in their own delusion? Are they a psychopath? Am I deluded? Should I forgive them? Should I just let go? What should one do? Anger and hate is poison, yet it feels completely justified. Why wasn't I wiser? Why couldn't I have seen things clearer? Can I really heal from this? \n\nSo comes this post. Thinking maybe that my testimony and warnings will be of some use to someone out there. That if my experiences could help someone else's path be a more joyous one than that would be good. Perhaps its just delusion. Perhaps that is part of my problem.\n\nEither way, be careful out there all you seekers, be wise. There are good teachers out there but there are so many traps. May being aware of this one case help your path in some way.\n\nAll love to all of you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61182, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Be Careful in the (Spiritual) World - The Case of Leo Gura of Actualized.org", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570566496, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dep8je/be_careful_in_the_spiritual_world_the_case_of_leo/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "knockedlooose", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1tlcua7u", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570479576, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dep3zi/gf_using_spirituality_to_possibly_invalidate/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dep3zi", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dep3zi/gf_using_spirituality_to_possibly_invalidate/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570479577, "score": 2, "selftext": "hey everyone, my family is narcissistic, broken, and dysfunctional, which has led me to trauma, but finding my spirituality a few years ago has helped. however, i\u2019m curious to know if this is disrespectful behaviour in the name of spirituality from my girlfriend, or if its due to my trauma, and well, i\u2019m just mainly looking for advice. i\u2019ve been with my girlfriend for a few months, and we travel together. we currently live in a hostel and use my car to get around. i tend to be a relatively neat person, but she\u2019s extremely messy and \u201ccan\u2019t live without some clutter\u201d. that\u2019s fine. but this is usually more than clutter, and i will give an example with the possible disrespectful twist. we were in my car the other night, and she placed a wax candle on my dashboard, but it was dark and i didn\u2019t notice. obviously she didn\u2019t light it, but i came into my car this morning and noticed it melted from the sun all over my dash, which was very annoying to see as i\u2019m pretty fed up with having to constantly tell her that i can\u2019t focus in a messy area. Her and I are very spiritual people, and her go-to response bothers and sometimes hurts me. To any of my worries about travels, finances, complaints about possible clutter messes she makes that i can sense coming on, and even my personal venting sessions that i should feel safe in confiding with her, she always responds \u201cdon\u2019t manifest that for us/you/me, etc\u201d. I understand and believe in manifestation, but I should be able to confide in her about my inner personal problems here and there about my family and whatnot. Here\u2019s where it ties into the melted candle: if I saw her put it on the dash that night, I would have kindly told her that I don\u2019t want it to melt so to please find a place for it, she would resort to \u201cif you manifest that, then it will melt, but i\u2019m not manifesting that for me, so it won\u2019t melt\u201d... then I wouldn\u2019t want to start an argument so i would let her leave the candle there, yet it would have melted anyways whether i manifested (aka. brought it up) or not.\n\nAny advice? I have tried talking to her about it, but nothing has changed. Should I focus more on the manifestation aspect, or does this seem like a valid reason to be upset?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61182, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Gf Using Spirituality to Possibly Invalidate", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570565970, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dep3zi/gf_using_spirituality_to_possibly_invalidate/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "zepmash", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3rvec2i8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570477989, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/deopx1/dont_fear_death/", "gilded": 1, "gildings": {"gid_2": 1}, "id": "deopx1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 42, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/deopx1/dont_fear_death/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570477991, "score": 188, "selftext": "When you die your \u201cessence\u201d departs the physical and material world we inhabit and returns to its source. Most people fear this change in state because they don\u2019t understand it. Religions disagree, science hasn\u2019t been able to conclusively prove anything about where we go, and cultures all speak of death and afterlife in different languages and traditions that fall within a very narrow and sometimes problematic scope of understanding. The best language to explain the mystery surrounding death (and that of the wild human experience too) hasn\u2019t been invented yet, or if it has, isn\u2019t commonly understood. Words will never do it justice, but I\u2019ll do my best. \nYou are a spiritual being having a human experience. You are a conscious being endowed with the same energy that animates everything around you. You are not simply a five sensory being like you have been taught, you are multisensory, and have more power within you than the people in power can afford for you to believe. \nYou\u2019re here to grow and become aware that you live in a zone of free-will, co-creating with a conscious universe full of diverse life and experience. Everything is connected and everything comes from the same source. The nature of a bipolar reality tricks us into believing in a nature of separation. You are you and I am me, clearly we are different, right? Wrong. In death, if you haven\u2019t yet learned it in life, you\u2019ll see how we are all expressions of the One, each experiencing life from a different locality, forgetting our source, so that we may one day remember and laugh at how convinced we were that we are alone. It\u2019s all a dream. \nYour belief system helps manifest the reality that you exist in. As your belief system changes and evolves during your lifetime, so do your experiences. When you die, you leave this physical realm and suddenly gain access to the stream of divine intelligence that you might have felt cut off from as a human. That\u2019s normal. The ego is naturally skeptical of things it can\u2019t see or touch because it\u2019s main focus is survival. It is the most primal urge that allows us to exist and survive on a planet such as Earth, full of danger and uncertainty. To understand death for what it really is, to have reverence for it, would mean accepting it... and the ego fears that above anything else. So we distance ourselves from it, and naturally we fear it. \nBut I can confirm from personal experience what happens when you die because it\u2019s happened to me twice.\nYou return home. You realize that this life was like a dream, and that you have lived many. In each life learning different lessons and achieving different goals towards your evolution, resolving karma, closing and opening cycles and participating in the great playground of creation. You return to be with those you love, rejoicing in knowing that \u201cdeath\u201d is not a destination, merely a door you pass through to get back to where you once were and where you\u2019re going next. You realize the physical body is merely a vehicle for spirit to have the ability to feel, think, believe, create and act. It is not you. The real you is so magnificently complex and infinite that it could not possibly fit into a single name or personality like we try and do here.  \nYou realize time is a creative concept that reinforces the ego\u2019s idea of what life is and how it\u2019s supposed to be. Human time in its linear expression is limiting and localizing. While it allows us to coexist in an organized way in this dimension, it put us in a box. And conveniently makes us believe that you can\u2019t move forward or backward in time. (You can)\nYou realize love is the most powerful force in existence, and the secret to the manifestation and expression of all that is. Sounds corny, but it\u2019s true y\u2019all. You realize everything that is and ever was and ever will be and you feel at peace. \nYou have this one human life to learn and live as much as you can. So don\u2019t fear death. Befriend it. You\u2019re lucky to be here and this human experience is one that is highly sought after by spirit. Fear will keep you prisoner, it will reinforce your suffering and keep you from realizing your true purpose on this planet. It\u2019s time to wake up. Things are moving rapidly and great change is coming. Many people will see these changes and respond with more fear. I\u2019m here to remind you that death is merely one step of the journey and you have nothing to fear. So don\u2019t spend the rest of your journey worried about it. Live now and don\u2019t forget the most crucial part and the hardest to remember in this big messy world sometimes: Love. \ud83d\udc95 \nNamaste friends", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61181, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Don\u2019t fear death", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570564373, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/deopx1/dont_fear_death/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mr_coffee", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_42gwr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570476833, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/deog00/if_youve_asked_for_help_and_are_still_searching/", "gildings": {}, "id": "deog00", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/deog00/if_youve_asked_for_help_and_are_still_searching/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570476834, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi friends,   \n\n\nYears ago I asked for help and I was drawn to Paul Selig's channeled work.

How? Here is an exercise I recommend to people to show them they are in control of their emotions and can feel happy and joy at will. \n\nFirst feel how you feel from a 1 to 10. 1 being awful to 10 being very very happy. Most would say maybe a 5 to 7. This is your starting number, write it down.\n\n Sit and close your eyes and take some deep breaths. On the 5th breath imagine, recall a time and place, event where you were the happiest you ever been in this lifetime. It can be a wedding, a party, a childbirth, a hug, riding a bike, sailing whatever, just insure it was a joyous memorable moment. Now BE in that moment FULLY. go there in your mind, FEEL it. Laugh if you were laughing, smile if you were smiling. hear the voices, the music the smells etc. Now really FEEL the moment. Now after sitting there for as long as you like, let the pictures go and just keep the feeling, notice it. Focus in on it alone. This is how you are feeling and it all came from within you right? Yes you used your imagination, but where did the feeling come from? Within you right? It ALWAYS have and always will only come from you, There IS NO outside pleasure. See? \n\nAll pleasure actually comes from within, the idea is to KNOW this as we forget and unconsciously believe that it comes from the lover, the animal the thing. See? It doesn't. So when the thing leaves, its OK. You ARE love, you don't HAVE love thats gone, you just were conditioned to believe you did. See? OK so you are in this joy feeling before you end the exercise check in, how do you feel now from 1 to 10? Number is higher right? That's the power of going within and you will never loose YOU.\n\nPlease after doing this exercies, show others by commenting with your starting and ending numbers like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nstart: 5\n\nend: 8\n\nIt may encourage others to do the exercise. \n\nthank you\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBless Sings", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61163, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Exercise that shows that joy and happiness is an inside job and not external", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570544908, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dek6yc/exercise_that_shows_that_joy_and_happiness_is_an/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "levissy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_371crle3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570448655, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/deiabz/what_do_spiritual_teachers_mean_when_they_say/", "gildings": {}, "id": "deiabz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/deiabz/what_do_spiritual_teachers_mean_when_they_say/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570448657, "score": 3, "selftext": "I must admit I couldn't find much on Google about this.And I have heard the saying joy and misery come from within but what does it mean to turn within?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61157, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What do spiritual teachers mean when they say turn within our turn inward?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570535043, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/deiabz/what_do_spiritual_teachers_mean_when_they_say/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "NsfwOlive", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_hju4j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570448616, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/deia3j/a_constant_feeling_of_having_done_something_wrong/", "gildings": {}, "id": "deia3j", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/deia3j/a_constant_feeling_of_having_done_something_wrong/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570448617, "score": 6, "selftext": "You know that feeling when you had a serious conversation with someone, and you mess up, and later you realize what you should have said or done instead?

I had a time in my life I was beating Humania. I could sit an entire day doing nothing. Absolutely nothing. While that's not the goal - to do nothing at all - but I hope you understand what I mean by the busyness of people in today's world, many unable to sit quietly with themselves without reaching out to their phone, a book, a computer, you name it. We are \"mad\", as Taylor says.\n\nWhy I started with this? Well, I'm in a crossroad in my life where I have no idea how Spirituality fits into my life. I'm torn between the need to live this life according to how I was raised - a Western kind of living - study, work, form a family, and constantly be on the move and have drive towards material gains. I went through many difficult stuff in the past couple of years because of Spirituality and Mysticism. Things I have done didn't go well and I ended up hospitalized couple of times. For instance, I tried to become a Breatharian (Not needing to eat to survive but live on \"Prana\"). I reached many unbelieveable things in this journey but the end result is that today I yearn for a \"normal\"/\"normative\" life. I want to be normal. To have a job, a family, friends, fields of interests/hobbies... but I have no idea anymore how Spirituality fits in this life as a way of life and not just a concept. I'm torn.\n\nOn the one hand, I see the beauty in the spiritual world and how Yogis and Gurus live in the Eastern world. I got, through channeling, that I'm Indian despite having no Indian heritage of any kind. I was Indian in past lives. I truly believe that. I see how much suffering the materialism of today's world is doing to people. We are so very sick, there's so much madness all around us. On the other hand, I want something to hold unto after everything I've been through. I yearn for a solid ground and be on one line with other people in my life. I have this all or nothing mindset because of what I've been through. It's either Spirituality all the way or no Spirituality at all.\n\nThis is the first time I'm on the computer in months. I used to be constantly on the computer as part of my spiritual journey, I got all the information and been doing my research and seeking using it. This is the first time I write something online in a long time.\n\nI'm not really sure what I look for when I write this post. I look for some solace. For some guidance. For something to hold unto, to give me some quiet in my unsettled mind. It makes me feel good writing this post. It makes me feel something I haven't felt in a long time, not sure if it's a feeling or just a mindset. I'm sitting on the computer and writing, something I used to do quite bit in the past and completely forsaken.\n\nI think I ask you this: is it a matter of balance? Is it a matter of complete dedication? I'm trying to do meditations but I'm so uneasy that I fail to gain anything substantial from it. I wonder if there's a place in my life for spirituality after all I've been through in this path. There's a world to be handled around me, after all. I'm not a Yogi. Perhaps I should be? Perhaps not? I've been getting messages through channeling to be a musician and an actor. Full-time. To invest all my energies into music and acting. I don't see how spirituality fits into this channeling. I question the messages I am getting for a while now.\n\nWhy I started with this? Well, I'm in a crossroad in my life where I have no idea how Spirituality fits into my life. I'm torn between the need to live this life according to how I was raised - a Western kind of living - study, work, form a family, and constantly be on the move and have drive towards material gains. I went through many difficult stuff in the past couple of years because of Spirituality and Mysticism. Things I have done didn't go well and I ended up hospitalized couple of times. For instance, I tried to become a Breatharian (Not needing to eat to survive but live on \"Prana\"). I reached many unbelievable things in this journey but the end result is that today I yearn for a \"normal\"/\"normative\" life. I want to be normal. To have a job, a family, friends, fields of interests/hobbies... but I have no idea anymore how Spirituality fits in this life as a way of life and not just a concept.

That is the highest perfectional stage of renunciation.**\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nReal renunciation means that one should always think himself part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Therefore he has no right to enjoy the results of his work. Since he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the results of his work must be enjoyed by the Supreme Lord. This is actually Kr\u1e63na consciousness. The person acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is really a sanny\u0101s\u012b, one in the renounced order of life. By such mentality, one is satisfied because he is actually acting for the Supreme. Thus he is not attached to anything material; he becomes accustomed to not taking pleasure in anything beyond the transcendental happiness derived from the service of the Lord. A sanny\u0101s\u012b is supposed to be free from the reactions of his past activities, but a person who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness automatically attains this perfection without even accepting the so-called order of renunciation. This state of mind is called yog\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dha, or the perfectional stage of yoga, as confirmed in the Third Chapter: yas tv \u0101tma-ratir eva sy\u0101t. One who is satisfied in himself has no fear of any kind of reaction from his activity.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the perfectional stage of yoga ?**\n\n[Picture : Bhagavad-gita

I was annoyed at being forced to go and started to resent the church community as a whole. i didn\u2019t understand it, and i didn\u2019t want to.\n\nFrom the ages of 10-18 I went through phases of trying to devote myself to the church and to god, by reading a \u201cchild\u2019s\u201d bible from cover to cover, praying to god every night, and going to church with my mom again. I did have wonderful experiences at church, and the sermons i had the opportunity to listen to we\u2019re moving and powerful. but as soon as i could feel myself opening up a little bit i would draw back again, thinking \u201cgod isn\u2019t real so why am i pretending like he is?? i\u2019ve been fine without church so far, i don\u2019t need to go\u201d. my mother is incredibly supportive and still asks me every sunday if i would like to go to church with her and become a part of the community, and i think it\u2019s so sweet of her to try.\n\ni want to believe so badly, but i feel like i\u2019m stopping myself from being fully invested and believing. i  have seen wait faith can do for others. it\u2019s a source of hope, love, service for others, and community. but still, every time i see someone post something along the lines of \u201cgod has blessed you\u201d or \u201ci have seen what god does for others\u201d i automatically have the response of \u201cwell god didn\u2019t do that, you did it for yourself. and god definitley hasn\u2019t done anything for me.\u201d \n\nwhy am i stopping myself?? why am i so negative?? why can\u2019t i believe??", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61138, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "tried to find god, i can\u2019t complete the journey but i want to?? confused.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570499491, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/decwqq/tried_to_find_god_i_cant_complete_the_journey_but/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lunaboro", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6nzc9p8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570409497, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dec7dk/woke_up_at_555_meaning/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dec7dk", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dec7dk/woke_up_at_555_meaning/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570409500, "score": 1, "selftext": "So I woke up at 555 AM today.

It's a small village in Bosnia where the virgin Mary started appearing to six kids like 50 years ago and relaying messages to them. Since then it has become a destination for catholics seeking to dive deeper into their faith. The people here are very religious. They offer daily mass in several different languages. Each mass is so packed the church is overflowing. It's actually quite incredible to be sitting in a group of over 2000 people where everyone is deep in prayer. \n\nToday was our second day here. The priest who was giving mass said a homophobic comment during the homily. He said that our world is getting crazy and morals are being thrown out the window, this I agree with. However, he then said that having gay marriage because of equality is ridiculous, that would be like offering funerals to people who are still alive for the sake of equality. I am a bisexual woman. I am currently in a relationship with another woman. This comment of his absolutely ruined the rest of the mass for me. He was equating queer people with soulless, lifeless bodies. Comments like this only make me feel ostracized from the church. They push me away from the church. Catholics wonder why younger generations aren't drawn to the church and it's comments/mentalities like that which is why. \n\nJesus came to Earth and said to follow two commandments, love God and love others as you love thyself. I follow both of these commandments with my whole heart. The Catholic church should be preaching love and acceptance, not bigotry and hate. I was raised in the Catholic church and have a lot of respect for the foundation of faith it gave me. But priests like that really turn me off the church altogether. \n\nNot so sure what I'm looking for posting this on here, just ranting mostly I guess. Also looking for other's opinions on this matter. I'm going to try and not let it affect the rest of my time here, but that comment really ruined a good portion of my day. Ok, rant over.

Therefore one should not give up the work which is born of his nature, O son of Kunt\u012b, even if such work is full of fault.**\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nIn conditioned life, all work is contaminated by the material modes of nature. Even if one is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he has to perform sacrifices in which animal killing is necessary. Similarly, a k\u1e63atriya, however pious he may be, has to fight enemies. He cannot avoid it. Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be, must sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to do business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot avoid them. Similarly, even though a man is a \u015b\u016bdra serving a bad master, he has to carry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done. Despite these flaws, one should continue to carry out his prescribed duties, for they are born out of his own nature.\n\nA very nice example is given herein. Although fire is pure, still there is smoke. Yet smoke does not make the fire impure. Even though there is smoke in the fire, fire is still considered to be the purest of all elements. If one prefers to give up the work of a k\u1e63atriya and take up the occupation of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he is not assured that in the occupation of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a there are no unpleasant duties. One may then conclude that in the material world no one can be completely free from the contamination of material nature. This example of fire and smoke is very appropriate in this connection. When in wintertime one takes a stone from the fire, sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts of the body, but still one must make use of the fire despite disturbing conditions. Similarly, one should not give up his natural occupation because there are some disturbing elements. Rather, one should be determined to serve the Supreme Lord by his occupational duty in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is the perfectional point. When a particular type of occupation is performed for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, all the defects in that particular occupation are purified. When the results of work are purified, when connected with devotional service, one becomes perfect in seeing the self within, and that is self-realization.\n\n**Question 1 : What are some of the defects in the occupational duties of various varnas (castes of Human Life in Sanatan dharma) ? How they can be purified and lead to self-realization ?**\n\n[Picture : Bhagavad-gita 18.48](https://gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/48)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61098, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 18.48", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570436810, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/de0je3/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1848/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "krik7", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_w5h6b3q", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570348038, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/de06k7/need_to_ask_about_some_numerology_stuff/", "gildings": {}, "id": "de06k7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/de06k7/need_to_ask_about_some_numerology_stuff/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570348039, "score": 3, "selftext": "Seeing this 5 types (time) a lot lately.

I asked for a spiritual gift that will help me with my consciousness expansion/self love, Azura placed a staff with a white orb on top of it.\n\nNext, I saw another guide/angel showed up but more like an old man with Chinese robes and alopecia. Not kidding. When I asked for a name Raphael came through. I don't even know if these names come truly or is it a work of my brain for an answer.\n\nHe gave me 2 balls of light, 1 that is white and the other a mix of purple and indigo, and a staff with a red orb on top. He said this is for courage and expansion of aura. Again, not sure if it's true or just my brain.\n\nCan someone tell me if an angel named Azura exists and verify if all these experience is true?

This is of course only my experience but if I would have wanted to read something like this, then others may too. \n\nI started get synchronicities about a year and a half ago. I was an alcoholic, in a dire situation being controlled and abused by the king of all narcissists (and a sociopath too) and was high on prescription pain meds to get me through my life lived fully for others. One day, I started getting pressure around my head. A spacious pressure almost. As the following few months went by, I came to realise that the pressure would actually answer me 'yes or no'. I'd ask or think about something and if it was a yes, I would get a tingle (it's the exact tingle you get when a particular piece of music or lyric gets you emotionally).\n\nOver the coming months, messages in music started to synchronise with my thoughts and this gave me the strength to leave my old life.\n\nOh, I was a full on atheist too at the start.\n\nI literally packed my stuff in black bags and ran away from my life and turned my phone off. This was Christmas 2018.\n\n\nFast forward almost a year on and now I have an incredible partner, and beautiful step-son and a creative production business that has taken off like a miracle!\n\nBut to get there has been really tough. \n\nBut I think I have worked out why the synchronicities happen. They started off small and then became more and more frequent, and more and more obvious, and more and more impossible until before I knew it, I was living in a miracle; an actual miracle. It got to a point where what I was thinking, someone would start talking about. I'd read and listen to music and the word from the song would perfectly match what I was reading. Like the word 'concrete' would be said in a song and I'd read the word the moment the song said it. \n\nNow this year I have cleansed so much from my being and have worked through so much stuff, and I mean some REAL dark stuff, but as I've done this, the synchronicities have increased. Here is a kind of idea of how many synchs I've had daily per month this year:\n\nJAN -MARCH: 3 or 4 per day\nAPRIL-JUNE: between 20-30 per day\nJULY - AUGUST: 30+ per day\nSEPTEMBER: Too many to keep track of.\nOCTOBER: Synchronicities have built up so much, I live in constant miracles. Always making things just at the right time. Just the right person contacting me at just the right time. \n\nAnd I think that is the plan isn't it? That's  the point. They synchronicities are there to say 'hey, look over here at this magic you don't know exists'. Some people never progress beyond this and spend forever questioning it, but it is a calling to drop whst makes you unhappy, move to be your authentic self and work through issues that have been built up in your psyche over the years.\n\nWe can ALL find miracle state, the synchronicities are calling us to do this. But you can only do this when you are true to yourself.\n\nWe are SUPPOSED TO live in miracles. That's default state with default metaphysics.\n\nNow I'm not perfect and I'm sure most of us aren't and I have bad days, even bad weeks where I get all existential about what to do when I have a day off! \ud83d\ude05 The miracles lessen during these times.\n\nThe law of attraction is a great idea and all, but once you are authentic and tuned in, you don't worry about that any more. You don't manifest from a place of lack (which is why people often fail at executing this properly), you manifest from a place of 'whats best for me? Whats best for my family? What feels like the right thing to do? What does my gut say we need?'. Once you get to miracle state, your best life just happens to you.\n\nIf you want to really work through some stuff, fast for like three days and see what stuff comes up; it's amazing what the toxicity in food does to you mentally. There may be so much you have buried.\n\nIf you're not up for fasting, just eat less, in fact try one meal a day. Drink plenty of water. Read and research as much as you can abour the metaphysical world. Have dark months where you feel like you don't know the point, but come through it victorious knowing that it's all an illusion and part of the process. \n\nNow I am no master of this at all, in fact I'm just really getting started and these are just my thoughts, but I truly want you all to reach miracle point. We are ALL capable of it and I want it so badly for you all. You are all beautiful and deserve the best. \ud83d\udc96", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61049, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The reason behind synchronicities", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570353718, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ddkzn8/the_reason_behind_synchronicities/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Halfaxa666", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_11ug5s41", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570261850, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ddk87f/evil/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ddk87f", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ddk87f/evil/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570261877, "score": 2, "selftext": "Do you believe in evil?

Prescribed duties, according to one's nature, are never affected by sinful reactions.**  \n**PURPORT**  \nJump to\u012bt\u0101.As already discussed in previous verses, the duties of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra are prescribed according to the particular modes of nature. One should not imitate another's duty. A man who is by nature attracted to the kind of work done by \u015b\u016bdras should not artificially claim himself to be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, although he may be born into a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family. In this way one should work according to his own nature; no work is abominable, if performed in the service of the Supreme Lord. The occupational duty of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is certainly in the mode of goodness, but if a person is not by nature in the mode of goodness, he should not imitate the occupational duty of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. For a k\u1e63atriya, or administrator, there are so many abominable things; a k\u1e63atriya has to be violent to kill his enemies, and sometimes a k\u1e63atriya has to tell lies for the sake of diplomacy. Such violence and duplicity accompany political affairs, but a k\u1e63atriya is not supposed to give up his occupational duty and try to perform the duties of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a.  \nOne should act to satisfy the Supreme Lord. For example, Arjuna was a k\u1e63atriya. He was hesitating to fight the other party. But if such fighting is performed for the sake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there need be no fear of degradation. In the business field also, sometimes a merchant has to tell so many lies to make a profit. If he does not do so, there can be no profit. Sometimes a merchant says, \"Oh, my dear customer, for you I am making no profit,\" but one should know that without profit the merchant cannot exist. Therefore it should be taken as a simple lie if a merchant says that he is not making a profit. But the merchant should not think that because he is engaged in an occupation in which the telling of lies is compulsory, he should give up his profession and pursue the profession of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. That is not recommended. Whether one is a k\u1e63atriya, a vai\u015bya, or a \u015b\u016bdra doesn't matter, if he serves, by his work, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who perform different types of sacrifice, sometimes must kill animals because sometimes animals are sacrificed in such ceremonies. Similarly, if a k\u1e63atriya engaged in his own occupation kills an enemy, there is no sin incurred. In the Third Chapter these matters have been clearly and elaborately explained; every man should work for the purpose of yaj\u00f1a, or for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anything done for personal sense gratification is a cause of bondage. The conclusion is that everyone should be engaged according to the particular mode of nature he has acquired, and he should decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the Supreme Lord.  \n**Question 1 : How occupational duties are prescribed ? What are the various occupational duties of a k\u1e63atriya mentioned in this verse ? How one can remain sinless while executing one's occupational duties ?** \n\n[Picture : Bhagavad-gita 18.47](https://gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/47)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61047, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 18.47", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570347078, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ddk2he/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1847/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Thisismehello1234", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4n1wng6w", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570260555, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ddk1ri/anybody_have_any_positive_paranormal_experiences/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ddk1ri", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ddk1ri/anybody_have_any_positive_paranormal_experiences/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570260664, "score": 1, "selftext": "just curious", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 61047, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "anybody have any positive paranormal experiences?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570346935, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ddk1ri/anybody_have_any_positive_paranormal_experiences/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SingleDadSoundcloud", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4dskn90x", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570255389, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ddjcsm/sorry_if_this_doesnt_belong_here_i_didnt_know/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ddjcsm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ddjcsm/sorry_if_this_doesnt_belong_here_i_didnt_know/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570255390, "score": 4, "selftext": "Background: me and SO have hit a good number of bumps in the road in just the last six to eight months.

It was some real heavy stuff but it all made so much sense.\n\nFast forward to a few months ago I stumbled upon a YouTube channel run by a guy named Joseph Alai. He basically consolidates Goddards teaching into something more user friendly. He taught Manifesting techniques that he said were \u201cfool-proof\u201d\nAt first I was really skeptical but after reading people\u2019s comments and applying some of his knowledge to my own life I realised that Manifesting is a powerful tool.\nHe talks about imagining that you already have what you want. Not by saying I will be rich and successful but by saying I AM rich and successful. \nThat\u2019s a simplistic explanation- it goes way deeper then that.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy what\u2019s been happening to me as of late. \nI literally got a raise, a relationship, and feel less stressed... all in the span of three months.\n\nHad anyone ever researched Manifesting?

As such, the Supreme Lord is the beginning of all living entities. This is confirmed in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra-janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25. The Supreme Lord is therefore the beginning of life of every living entity. And the Supreme Lord, by His two energies, His external energy and internal energy, is all-pervading. Therefore one should worship the Supreme Lord with His energies. Generally the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava devotees worship the Supreme Lord with His internal energy. His external energy is a perverted reflection of the internal energy. The external energy is a background, but the Supreme Lord by the expansion of His plenary portion as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is situated everywhere. He is the Supersoul of all demigods, all human beings, all animals, everywhere. One should therefore know that as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord it is his duty to render service unto the Supreme. Everyone should be engaged in devotional service to the Lord in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is recommended in this verse.\n\nEveryone should think that he is engaged in a particular type of occupation by H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, the master of the senses. And, by the result of the work in which one is engaged, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, should be worshiped. If one thinks always in this way, in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then, by the grace of the Lord, he becomes fully aware of everything. That is the perfection of life. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, te\u1e63\u0101m aha\u1e41 samuddhart\u0101. The Supreme Lord Himself takes charge of delivering such a devotee. That is the highest perfection of life. In whatever occupation one may be engaged, if he serves the Supreme Lord, he will achieve the highest perfection.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the two different energies of the Lord ? What is the difference between them ? How the Supreme lord is all-pervading ?**\n\n**Question 2 : How by doing one's occupational duties, one can attain perfection of life ?**\n\n[Picture : Bhagavad-gita 18.46](https://gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/46)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 60978, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 18.46", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570265509, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dd4pi9/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1846/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "InnerPeacePractice", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_32sh36ip", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570176690, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dd4emu/finding_your_purpose/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dd4emu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dd4emu/finding_your_purpose/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570176691, "score": 3, "selftext": "**Finding your purpose with QHHT \u2013 an inspiring past life**\n\n**What is QHHT?**\n\nQuantum Healing Hypnosis Technique (QHHT) is a technique developed by Dolores Cannon and now is a popular modality used throughout the world to enable people to clearly access their Higher Selves for the purpose of attaining healing and wisdom. \n\nA QHHT session usually takes between 5 \u2013 7 hours and unfolds in four stages. First, is the initial interview where the client talks about their life, in particular their childhood and this enables the QHHT practitioner to ask the most helpful questions while the client is under hypnosis. The client then lies down and is guided to connect with a past life (sometimes the client finds themselves as another life form, on another planet or in a different dimension). The second stage involves exploring the past life. If it\u2019s appropriate, the client can be guided to the spirit world after this. In the third stage, the Higher Self of the client comes in and answers the client\u2019s questions and gives healing, when appropriate. After the client is brought back to the present, a discussion of what unfolded helps the client to begin the integration process.  \n\n**Life Purpose**\n\nMost clients ask about their life purpose when they have their QHHT session. Dolores Cannon calls it \u201cthe eternal question\u201d. Sometimes it is the primary reason a client has a session.\n\nOften clients tell me in the initial interview of their QHHT session that they think one thing is their purpose, but when they are under hypnosis their Higher Self says something completely different. Sometimes their purpose was something they were passionate about as a child and most of the time it involves helping others.\n\n**The Session**\n\nThis particular client, who I\u2019ll call Diana, was in her early twenties and had changed university courses several times. The current course she was doing, also wasn\u2019t resonating with her. She was constantly getting sick and there was no apparent reason why. Her passion was yoga and she felt an affinity with India.\n\nDiana was relaxed and guided into a theta brainwave state. Her Higher Self showed her two life times. The first was where she\u2019d been imprisoned as a male soldier, but after the war he was freed and made a very happy life for himself surrounded by family. The second lifetime involved emotional imprisonment, but more importantly served as an inspiring life for Diana to experience so she could fully realise her potential.\n\n**An Inspirational Lifetime**\n\nIn the first scene Diana landed in, she was about five years old in the slums of India.  She lived with her family in a mud hut and she was healthy and happy running around with the other children from the slums. But even then she knew that *myparents are waiting to marry me off*.\n\nAt the age of sixteen, she was dressed in a beautiful sari on an elephant about to marry a wealthy man she didn\u2019t like. They had a big wedding and she was *feeling trapped*. The palace they lived in was luxurious and there was a lot of hired help, but still she spent much of her time looking after her husband.\n\nThe next event she experienced was running away with a man who worked in the palace. They had fallen in love and escaped together. They walked for days trying to find another village. Eventually they took a train to the city where he got a job. Sometime later she got a university degree and taught English. She was *feeling fulfilled*and intended to *keep learning.*\n\nShe remained with the man she loved, but they didn\u2019t have their own children. She wrote a book and received a medal for it. She was *feeling really accomplished.*\n\nSometime later, they adopted twin boys and a girl from the slums to create a loving family and to give the children an education. The five of them lived in an apartment in the city. The children visited their families in the slums. Many years on, she and her husband were with her adopted daughter when their daughter gave birth in hospital. At that time she was still teaching.\n\nThis amazing lady died peacefully surrounded by her family. \n\n**The Lesson**\n\nHer lesson for this lifetime was that the less she had, the happier she was. Her purpose was to adopt and teach those children from the slums. She was told to trust her knowing, to take a risk and to never play safe. \n\n**The Wisdom**\n\nDiana\u2019s Higher Self confirmed that her path was to go to India to become a yoga teacher. She was to remain open and the teachers and opportunities would appear. All her health issues stemmed from not living her purpose. Her Higher Self said once she was living her purpose her good health would return. \n\nDiana followed her path by giving up university and then trained to be a yoga teacher. Soon after her good health returned. \n\nTo find a QHHT practitioner located near you, see [https://www.qhhtofficial.com/find-a-practitioner](https://www.qhhtofficial.com/find-a-practitioner)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 60975, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Finding Your Purpose", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570263071, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dd4emu/finding_your_purpose/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AsgarGER", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_r9398", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570174528, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dd44gl/intentions/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dd44gl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dd44gl/intentions/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570174530, "score": 1, "selftext": "I intend to forgive the mistakes of yesterday, to learn from them, to be grateful for today &amp; to love my humanity.

XIX\n\nMy mother did not cry.\u00a0We sat in silence as the moon emerged.\u00a0After a while, he took Aunt Gandhari to the river and performed their ablutions for the deceased.\u00a0Seeing that my mother had not shed a single tear, I thought that nothing could touch her now.\u00a0Perhaps Karna's death had burned most of her pain and what was left of her austerities had consumed him.\u00a0Seeing her carry the water on her hip to Aunt Gandhari, while she leaned with all her weight on our mother's shoulder, made Sahadeva and Bhima rage.\u00a0But, although I did not like to see her reduced to this, she, who had been so carefully raised in the Kuntibhoja palace, showed no dissatisfaction on her face.\u00a0It was Aunt Gandhari who moaned with the news that her husband's brother did not exist anymore.\u00a0\u201cWhat will my lord do without his brother and advisor?\u00a0We are alone. \u201dIndeed, she had never left Hastina.\u00a0He must have spent all the punya of his austerities on the curse he threw against Krishna and Dwaraka because he still spoke of his children with torment and, when we brought his widows to prostrate themselves before the old queen, he hurt passionately with each one of them.\u00a0We spent part of the night in silence under a sky of auspicious constellations and finally we lay down to sleep on the bare ground, close to our mother ... all but Yudhisthira, who spent the night in meditation.\u00a0I remembered a similar night in Panchala, when we took Draupadi to our mother, after I won her in the swayamvara.\u00a0The children born from that marriage were no longer with us.\u00a0Those who were for us parents - Drupada, Virata and Uncle Vidura - had left their bodies.\u00a0The life that our mother led could not last long.\u00a0The world rested in us.\u00a0The time had not yet come to join them, but I had never been so close to wanting it.\u00a0Only the memory of Parikshita, and of Subhadra of course, called me back to Hastina.\u00a0And there was always Krishna.\u00a0He was the life he invited to follow.\u00a0While he was in the world, I would feel the pull towards him.\u00a0Krishna's life was not in the hermitages;\u00a0he had given me a law of life and action.\u00a0In the morning, after the ablutions, Yudhisthira was led by the wise to honor their forest dwellings with their darshan.\u00a0Even in the forest an anointed king is King.\u00a0Thus, followed by his servants and our priests and all the ladies and the entourage, we inhaled the smoke of many sacrificial altars where fires flared and libations were poured in honor of all deities.\u00a0I loved the altars provided with fruits and roots and lots of flowers.\u00a0Many of those sages had skin that glowed from within with a light that all our oils and ointments could not produce.\u00a0Deer visited their shelters without fear.\u00a0The forest echoed with the cries of the peacocks and the trills and the songs of the birds.\u00a0Here too the king's presents were to be delivered.\u00a0We had brought thousands of wooden dishes, pots and saucepans, sacrificial spoons of copper, cups and vessels of all sizes, skins and blankets.\u00a0Each of the wise men in the forest got as much as he needed.\u00a0Everyone had learned of our arrival and we, who had difficulty finding those we were looking for, were found as if the birds had proclaimed our presence.\nPatriarch Vyasa also arrived.\u00a0In his honor, he allowed Uncle Dhritarashtra to carry him where we had camped, next to the shelter of our aunt and our mother.\u00a0When the grandfather gently informed him of Vidura's death, the tears that I thought consumed forever began to flow.\u00a0The patriarch, who was his father, stroked his head.\u00a0\u201cVidura is eternal.\u00a0By divine order and through the energy of my austerities he was called to Earth, a deity among deities.\u00a0Vidura is Dharma, like Yudhisthira.Dharma is like fire or like wind or water or space or earth.\u00a0The Dharma saturates the universe ... but you can light a fire and let it warm you. \u201dPatriarch Vyasa's eyes met mine.\u00a0His gaze read: Do you see, Arjuna, how the attachments we forge bind us to pain?\u00a0Or so I understood.\u00a0It was something that Krishna had tried to teach me in the Kurukshetra, something that I never understood as well as at that time, when I saw my uncle's soul calm, which with such effort I had conquered, shattered in that way.\u00a0Our deadly loves are like sticky climbers that emit a million tendrils.\u00a0You cut them by the root and see them continue to grow.\u00a0Understanding that his brother's soul had penetrated Yudhisthira, Uncle Dhritarashtra took our older brother in his arms and clung to him, stroking his cheeks, head, hands.Once with us grandfather Vyasa, the whole forest gathered around him.\u00a0Here he was the King.\u00a0He sat on a black deer skin with kusa grass on top, covered with fine silk.\u00a0Each brought his doubts and problems.\u00a0The wise men confessed to him and sought his help.\u00a0Hadn't he taken all the Vedas under the care of his dedication?\u00a0Indeed, he radiated with his light and, like Krishna, asserted: \"Do not forget that the Vedas already dwell in all your hearts.\" While one after another the great sages of the forest carried their questions to the patriarch, I would say to Myself: How little any earthly being really knows.\u00a0Watching my mother day by day, I thought she was one of those who no longer had questions to ask, but in the end she also went to the patriarch and laid her head at her feet.He knew what Kunti wanted to say without words and saved him the confession of his doubts and pain.\u00a0He took her hand and said: \u201cKunti, my girl, three times blessed by me are you, for you have served three children begotten by my energy.\u00a0Be at peace when it comes to the birth and death of Karna.\u00a0There was no lack in you.\u00a0You had a destiny.The energy of the gods works through humanity.The great souls who decide to come to Earth at their request agree to assume a portion of human pain before birth.\u00a0You were a virgin in the soul.There was no lack in you. \u201dMy mother looked up at him and I saw, inside that woman with white hair, the girl who had given birth to a child in secret and let him float on the waters of the river.\u00a0\"You belong to humanity and you are great,\" continued Grandfather Vyasa.\u00a0\u201cBecause for the great everything is valid, for the great there is nothing impure.\u00a0To the great each action brings merit. \u201dMy mother looked at him imploringly still.\u00a0What else could he tell her?\u00a0\"Kunti, my daughter,\" he murmured, \"the great feels everything as his own and does not look to the right or left to see what others are doing, nor does he measure his actions for what men think.\u00a0And it has the Vedas within itself.\u00a0Through your own life, your own truth is revealed to you.\u00a0You, who have Krishna as a nephew, should know this.\u00a0It is this truth that he has come to teach us. \u201dIn front of all of us, my mother burst into violent sobs and the words I tried to say drowned in her throat.\u00a0His voice was syncopated, as if someone from inside hit his chest.\u00a0Finally, his words became audible.\u00a0\u201cWhen he became a man, he recognized me as his mother.\u201d Again the sobs tensed his voice, but it wasn't over.\u201cI did not want him by my side.\u00a0I wanted that only to help the rest of my children. \u201dThat said it sank so completely that his body was twisting back and forth, and he covered his face with his hands.Through his fingers, he exclaimed his last regret: \u201cNow I can never tell him.\u00a0He will never know that I loved him more than anyone else. \u201dVyasa looked past her, smiling.\u00a0Later the idea came to me that he had smiled at Karna.\u00a0The comfort my mother needed was beyond words.\u00a0Maybe that was when the patriarch decided how to give it to him.\u00a0But now it was Aunt Gandhari who came forward and spoke for herself and for all the widows the Kurukshetra had done.\u00a0While my mother was crying unable to contain herself, Aunt Gandhari knelt beside her and said to the patriarch: \u201cI know you have the power.\u00a0I, who have misused my hidden power, know, however, that it can be done thanks to the merit achieved. \u201dHis voice became rough.\u00a0\u201cAnd who has greater merit than you, O Immaculate?\u201d \u201cMy daughter,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are all at peace now.\u00a0Why are you unable to see it? \u201d\u201c In peace!\u00a0May goodness fall on you, father.\u00a0In peace? \u201dHis eyes must have looked defiant behind the blindfold.\u00a0In vain he tried to hide the indignation of his voice.\u00a0\u201cWhat are you saying, father?\u00a0You just told your daughter Kunti that we belong to humanity, that nothing that is human is inappropriate.\u00a0Father, then my feelings are my Vedas.\u00a0I have practiced austerities, but I still grieve for my children.\u00a0And more than that, I am burned by the idea that it was my son who caused the war.\u00a0A knife in my heart is to think that I gave birth to a son who has made widows of all these women.\u00a0What penances are good for this?\u00a0There is none.\u00a0There is no human mind that has ever measured the depth and breadth of my mistake and its consequences.\u00a0The earth is razed because I could not prevent my brother from corrupting my eldest son.\u00a0Father, you say that we are at peace now and that the souls of our children are at peace ... well, show us, father.\u00a0If, thanks to your merit, you can show us our children, then my soul will be truly at peace. \u201dAgain, Patriarch Vyasa looked beyond her.\u00a0A long time passed without answering.\u00a0Finally, looking still beyond the river, he murmured: \u201cGandhari, my daughter, blessed are you.\u00a0Tonight you will contemplate your children and brothers and friends and relatives.\u00a0You have never seen some with your mortal eyes.\u00a0Your king will also see them and Kunti will be able to hug Karna.\u00a0Draupadi will see his five children, his father and his brothers again.\u00a0You, Arjuna, \u201dand his eyes sought me wrapped in a smile,\u201c you will embrace the one who is always in your thoughts.\u00a0He will emerge as from a dream and you will go straight to him.\u00a0And you will receive the hug of Dronacharya.\u00a0Yudhisthira will be hugged by Karna and Dronacharya.Dhritarashtra will see his children and brothers.\u00a0You will see the radiant soul of Sakuni embraced by all.The great Bhishma will return with all Vasus.\u00a0Madri will also rise and see her children once more. \u201d\u201c What about my lord? \u201d, The anguished voice of a woman emerged from the semicircle.\u00a0\u201cYou will see Bhurisravas.\u00a0You will see your lord. \u201d\n\u201cAnd mine, O Immaculate?\u201d \u201cThe brave Bhagadatta will take you in his arms tonight.\u201d There was a sound of sobs.\u00a0\"And my father?\" Asked the childish voice of a girl.\u00a0\"Your father will bless you.\" \"And my brother?\" \"And my father?\" \"And my lord?\" Patriarch Vyasa raised his hands in blessing to all of us.\u00a0\u201cI promise you.\u00a0They will rise like a dream.\u00a0Everyone will be there, everyone, everyone, not one will be missing. \u201dWe spent that morning as children split between hope and doubt.\u00a0How could we hug the dead?\u00a0Grandfather Vyasa had promised me that Abhimanyu would throw himself into my arms.\u00a0I had been told that the skull had been shattered ... I could imagine shadows rising, but not our children in flesh and blood.\u00a0I watched the sun at noon with hope, but as I marched west my expectation faltered.\u00a0How could it be such a thing?\u00a0How could it be?\u00a0Many times I had hugged Abhimanyu in dreams, but was it the merit that Vyasa had achieved with his austerities so great that the soul would take meat?\u00a0He had stopped the landslide, yes, but once Yama's tie had hunted a soul he never returned it.\u00a0Many of our ladies spent the day in silence and prayer;\u00a0those who spoke did it only as a meeting.\u00a0Long before usual time, we bathe for afternoon prayers.\u00a0I heard voices, muffled by the shock or anxiety.\u00a0\u201cThis day passes like a year.\u201d \u201cLike a century, you will say.\u201d \u201cMy heart beats faster at every moment.\u201d I sat apart and stroked the still hot stones with my hands, remembering moments with Abhimanyu.\u00a0I saw Krishna's foot raised over Parikshita's tiny body that Ashwatthama's curse had killed.\u00a0I remembered Abhimanyu in Indraprastha on a radiant winter day, when I gave him his first bow and, in the Kurukshetra, his flag swallowed by the enemy when he galloped against his akshauhinis ... memory scraps that stretched time to make it eternal and invaded this strange e swollen hour\u00a0I saw him, that little young man, touching my feet the last time I went to the children's rooms, after the game of dice.\u00a0This wait was something between the moments that precede the battle and the date with the woman you love, but a hundred times larger, and in none of those was the essence of this feeling perceived.We would penetrate another world, a world that can only be found when one embarks on the unknown journey.\u00a0It was like hearing Yama's silent steps.\u00a0The women perceived it.\u00a0Some felt danger hovering over them, but none left.\u00a0After the ablutions he followed the evening ritual.\u00a0The sun was delaying in the sky as if he wanted to stand guard all night.Small lights were rocked and prayers sung, but Surya still hung fiercely, guarding the horizons.Finally he plunged into fire like that fourteenth day of battle.\u00a0Patriarch Vyasa ordered us to place ourselves along the riverbank.\u00a0But there was time, he said, before night fell.\u00a0I think it was his immense shakti that made the next hour extend to eternity.\u00a0It gave us time to look inside ourselves.\u00a0As the sky drained the day, the birds gathered and their squeak and squeak rose to a tone that I had never heard.\u00a0I wondered if they could see the spectral presences that I was beginning to feel.\u00a0Sages from distant hermitages, with the clothes still wet from their bath in the river, arrived in silence.\u00a0The sky became an intensity of reds and purples and, suddenly, the strident of twittering and singing of birds rose to the frenzy.\u00a0One more moment and there was silence.\u00a0A frog, then, a simple frog sang the cry of its croaking ... croaking ... croaking ... Moments later other frogs joined him and the noise became thunderous.\u00a0Then, they all fell silent, as if obeying an order of Patriarch Vyasa.\u00a0It was perhaps the first time since we left Hastina that no one in the entire assembly spoke.\u00a0All our energy was focused on expectation.\u00a0My mind began to recite prayers that were both fear and hope.\u00a0Where was Grandpa Vyasa?\u00a0I felt like a child looking for his father's hand as he crossed the threshold of darkness.\u00a0The only sound was that of the flow of water.\u00a0The sky turned a vaporous red and gradually darkened to let the first stars appear.\u00a0The trees dimmed, the stars came up.\u00a0Forcing the view, I scanned the air over me, from where Abhimanyu's form could descend.\u00a0A little splash and my gaze flew to the place where a figure had penetrated the water.\u00a0It was Patriarch Vyasa.\u00a0He laid his palms on the surface.\u00a0The crickets began to chant again as released one by one;\u00a0The frogs joined them.Moments later, a drone was heard.\u00a0The earth began to sigh and a grunt erupted from its depths, as if something had been taken from it.\u00a0Without turning my head, I looked right and left.\u00a0Everything was still.\u00a0On the other side of the river there was nothing but solid darkness.\u00a0I felt reverberations.Did they come from me or from the land where I was sitting?\u00a0If from me, they came from deep inside;\u00a0if from the earth, from its deepest core.\u00a0I laid my palm on the floor to calm him.\u00a0Time, which had restrained all day, now threw us, past midnight, into a black eternity and then reversed.\u00a0The flow of the river changed direction.\u00a0The threat of the gods hung in the air.\u00a0I could not keep praying.\u00a0The figure in the water begged for us: even in the midst of chaos, I felt the strength of his compassion.\u00a0He fought for us with entrenched forces since the beginning of time.\u00a0He raised his hands together and bowed his head.\u00a0The echoes of their silent mantras could be felt all along the river.\u00a0There was a tension like when two clubs are locked in battle.Then something yielded and withdrew.\u00a0And now there came a murmur, strange in the air, weak at first, familiar later, recognizable at last as the wheels of the cars.\u00a0Wheels of cars and cavalry, but muffled as if tires and helmets were lined with clothes, and then the earth was wrapped in bands of sound of the creak of the cars and, one after another, of the clamor of the conches and the cries of war.\u00a0When the first banner rose above the waters, sighs and screams sounded all over our shore.\u00a0Then nothing could be heard against the tumult of a thousand car wheels rumbling against the stones of the riverbed.\u00a0The first car, pulled by silver horses, ran over the water and was followed by another and another.\u00a0Kurukshetra was before us and I felt that I was on my feet and that the movement took me to the one who was looking for me, whom I should look for.\u00a0My heart began to sing.\u00a0I found myself in a dark and burnished form.His eyes shone with the light of one who prays, introverted.\u00a0Someone watched us while we were there, face to face.\u00a0The one who looked at us was Dronacharya.\u00a0The one in front was Ekalavya.\u00a0He joined his palms in a gesture of salutation and I saw that he had his whole hands.\u00a0We fell into each other's arms then and in the long hug that followed I knew that I had never committed injustice with him and that I was cleansed of sin.\u00a0His destiny was not to be the best archer because he was something even bigger ... the true disciple.\u00a0We parted and I fell at the foot of Dronacharya, who raised me to his heart before he fell again at the feet of Ekalavya.\u00a0When I looked around, the river had transformed into a stream of light.\u00a0Soft light, powerful but not dazzling.\u00a0Whole families gathered under those trees like flames that lined the river.Draupadi was with his twin.\u00a0They offered the same image as when I first saw them in their swayamvara and he announced the evidence that the suitors should face.\u00a0But now they were on an altar where the flames played, flames that didn't burn them because the twins had been born from the altar, from their father's aspiration.\u00a0He was behind them and the brothers turned and knelt before him, who raised them to embrace them.\u00a0The children of Draupadi - one of them, mine - waited to prostrate at his feet.\u00a0They were all forms of light and, when Shrutakirti came to me, it seemed more real than the son I had known.\u00a0It was his Self, his very self, the soul in him.\u00a0How can I talk about what we were, what we really are?\u00a0We were all radiant souls.\u00a0When I try to remember them, I can only do it with a mind that deforms them and a heart that longs for them.\u00a0I can't conjure words that recreate them.\u00a0How could i\u00a0I am nothing but a warrior.\u00a0I was still looking at Shrutakirti when I felt that my heart was expanding with a bliss that only comes to be known in other worlds;\u00a0somewhere, a door had opened wide.\u00a0I waited.\u00a0Karna approached, glaring with the light that was her generosity, her loyalty, the light that comes from that great source that feeds us all, the Sun, Sri Surya.\u00a0We looked at each other until I felt that I merged completely with him.I was not aware of anything but this bliss of immortal union.\u00a0Finally, he took me by the shoulders with his strong hands and turned me until he had me face to face with Abhimanyu.\u00a0My son wore the glow and wore a garland garland around the neck.\u00a0My son!\u00a0The son of Subhadra.Patriarch Vyasa had taken us where we were all children and brothers, parents and children.\u00a0We were all part of each other and all fragments of the Creator.\u00a0We are from that other world, but we do not know.\u00a0Deprived of knowledge, a cold wind of ignorance binds us to the mind's way of seeing.And the mind does not see the truth.\u00a0Not even Rishis can sing the glory of that world.\u00a0Although they are impelled to sing, their hymns are not even crow's voices beside the sweetest notes of the flute and the vina.\u00a0The Rishis themselves say so in what became one of my favorite songs, Yata Vacho Nivartante ... Where words return to the mind without being touched by THAT.\u00a0Those who had left their bodies were on the other shore.\u00a0We are in the middle, in great competition ... But, when I say 'in the middle' or 'the other shore', these are just words.\u00a0There was only one place.\u00a0All site\u00a0Everyone was everywhere.\u00a0Bhurisravas and Bhagadatta, Jayadratha and Sakuni, the ten sons of Satyaki and Duryodhana and their brothers.\u00a0No one was missing.\u00a0The air was filled with silence, music, perfume, a movement that was still.\u00a0I had a glimpse of the warriors sky.\u00a0Some time later, it was like a glass emptied of the Soma liquor but that retains its fragrance and craves it forever and ever.He knew, however, that the domain to which Patriarch Vyasa had led us was not the highest heaven.\u00a0Krishna had taken me further ... as far as my mortal form had been able to bear it without breaking apart.\u00a0I have known Kshatriyas who believed that the warriors' sky was a place where you won battles and covered you with garlands every day.\u00a0Maybe someone would go to a similar place, but I liked to think that for most the sky had surprises that it was impossible to dream.\u00a0How much time do we spend with our loved ones?\u00a0How long is eternity?\u00a0As soon as Patriarch Vyasa dismissed the contest, it sank into the water in an instant and disappeared, leaving us at the river's edge as we tried to adapt our eyes to the first flash of dawn and to the squeak of the birds our ears.Both were rough.\u00a0We do not leave the forest for a few days.\u00a0The ladies, our widowed ladies, had discovered that the love they gave to their lords was tinged with something much more sacred than they ever dreamed.\u00a0Because all of Vyasa's revelation focused on the mystery of life and the salutary power of love.\u00a0Mourning and regret had become among us in a sweet longing.\u00a0We barely talked.\u00a0Our conversation was with the now invisible but always present.\u00a0Gradually, the pressure faded.The riverbank, where we spent hours contemplating the water and remembering, gradually lost its echoes and the murmurs became sigh and weakened, became sigh and died.\u00a0Only the words of grandfather Vyasa remained.\u00a0\u201cHave you not understood, my dearest ones, my immaculate ones, my Gentile souls?\u00a0The one who, when the time of separation comes, gives himself to pain is futile and senseless.\u00a0He who is unable to see that there is no separation should never try to form union, because that means suffering.\u00a0In truth the separation does not exist.\u00a0That is what you have been shown. \u201dWords like these can make you reverberate the soul, they can throw a stone into the pool of your being, but over time the waves faint.\u00a0A climax comes, a time when life makes itself heard.\u00a0Although for a while I thought I would never want to leave the forest that had shown me Ekalavya and Abhimanyu, my Gurudeva and the Great Patriarch Bhishma, something pulled me towards Parikshita and Subhadra.\u00a0The karma of my mother's life had run out and her great pain was left at rest.\u00a0Karna had let her take him in her arms and called her 'mother'.\u00a0She had finally understood that he had nothing his firstborn to forgive him.\u00a0Aunt Gandhari was silent too.\u00a0Her brothers and her children were whole in her again and were no longer shattered bodies whose blood Bhima drank.He had seen all his children hug Bhima and, when he approached her, Aunt Gandhari hugged him too.And uncle Dhritarashtra had done the same with his eyes overflowing with tears, eyes that saw his children for the first time.\u00a0Another strange thing happened: Sanjaya, who had seen the whole war with his inner eye, now lost his special gift of hidden vision.\u00a0Yudhisthira did not want to leave our mother, nor did Sahadeva.\u00a0So it was that Patriarch Vyasa threw himself into one of those delicious stories of his, which served from fable to fable until he reached the point he wanted to convey.\u00a0He addressed Uncle Dhritarashtra and commented: \u201cAlthough you did not fight on the battlefield, you have seen the heavens sanctified by weapons.\u00a0You are one of the few.\u00a0These planes are rarely shown to men while they still occupy their earthly bodies, or they would stop fulfilling their duty in the world.Your duty is fulfilled, but not Yudhisthira's.Yudhisthira has asked you to let him stay here, serving his mother's feet. \u201d\nUncle Dhritarashtra let a few moments pass without responding.\u00a0Then he bowed his head.\u201cYudhisthira says that, now that my younger brother is gone and that Sanjaya has lost his hidden vision, it would be too difficult for his mother to take care of Gandhari and me.\u201d Love and longing carried his voice.\u00a0But Vyasa replied: \u201cYou must order him to leave, my son.\u00a0It will be hard for Kunti, it is true, but she has made her decision and does not want her son to disregard his duty.\u00a0You who have sat on a throne know that sovereignty must always be kept and maintained.\u00a0Without their ruler, O son of the Kuru race, the kingdom that was yours will engender envious and enemies.\u00a0It is up to you to call Yudhisthira and send him back.\u00a0Tell him that his duty is to return to the kingdom and rule. \u201dIt was I who was sent to call him.\u00a0Yudhisthira was sitting in a circle with a group of sages from the forest.\u00a0From a distance, it was indistinguishable from the rest.\u00a0There was the same stillness and serenity in him.\u00a0He had adapted to his ways, dressed and ate like them, and incessantly passed the bad bills between his fingers.\u00a0His lips moved in a mantra, as he listened to a speech about the virtue of renunciation.\u00a0He came with me as quickly as an obedient boy, but he listened to our uncle in stubborn silence.\u00a0\u201cPain no longer affects me, Yudhisthira.\u00a0Thanks to you and the goodness of our noble father, I live here happier than ever in Hastina, \u201dsaid Uncle Dhritarashtra.\u00a0\"But there is one thing that could tarnish my peace: feeling that once again I am missing my duty because of excessive love.\" This was something Yudhisthira understood.\u00a0\u201cWe have received from you, Yudhisthira, everything that loving parents can dream of a child.\u00a0Your name, oh faultless, will survive the ages as a legend of filial devotion;\u00a0but, if you stay with us now, before your own time has come, you will become an obstacle to our desires and awaken our regrets.\u00a0In addition, the responsibility of our funerals rests with you now.The achievements of our race and our ancestors rest on your shoulders.\u00a0It is a burden, we know your heart;\u00a0but don't delay here, Lord of the Bh\u00e1rata Race.\u00a0I do not need to remind you again of the duties of a king because you have always known them better than any man. \u201dWithout looking up, Yudhisthira protested:\u201c Let my brothers leave and order me to stay.\u00a0I have two mothers and I will serve them and you. \u201dYudhisthira, after tasting the joys and visions, the fruits of the contemplative life he had always dreamed of, for the first time in his life he asked for himself.\u00a0\"I want to serve my mother,\" he repeated.\u00a0We, the five Pandavas, were sitting around our uncles and our mother, listening.Now, Sahadeva exploded: \u201cYudhisthira, I beg you to allow me to stay.\u00a0I am not necessary in Hastina, but you are. \u201dThere was such passion in his voice that Nakula came and sat next to him in silent solidarity.\u00a0Nakula would not leave without her twin.I watched Bhima.\u00a0Here we were, having won an empire, eager only for the life of the forest.\u00a0Not even Bhima protested.\u00a0I looked at the floor, frowning.\u00a0Yudhisthira and Sahadeva watched our mother, full of their faces of pain, waiting for some decree from heaven to free them from their royal duties.\u00a0When I looked at them from my mother, I realized that of all of us she was the only one free, with her dense white hair without fixing and her wrinkled face calm.\u00a0Maybe she read my thoughts because she raised her hand to pull her tangled hair away from her face.\u00a0What I saw hurt my heart.His jaw and cheekbone were swollen and scratched.\u00a0He must have fallen.\u00a0There was no one else who could take our uncles to bathe, because old Sanjaya could no longer take on these tasks.They were so fragile, they three.How could we abandon her to her decision ... because it was her decision? How dare to contradict her? Krishna's words returned: Arjuna has not killed his human compassion. None of us had done it. After our lunch of roots and fruits of the forest we decided to go all together to my mother again before her midday break. We sat under a tree by the river. Yudhisthira was our spokesperson. He again stated his plea. If he could not break his vow to serve his elders, he had to stay with two of us. \u201cMy children,\u201d he said just with that voice, firm and tender, that he will use when we return with Draupadi from his swayamvara, \u201cI love you all. Although Sahadeva is the youngest and my darling, I have other reasons for the love I feel for each of you. Through the first child, one learns from the joys and dangers of a mother's life.One also learns that children are much stronger than they seem. So with the second child and those who come later one knows not to be afraid and can enjoy them with less anxiety, despite each fall and each fever. After my third son, Arjuna, I thought it was the last time I would have a child. That was really the case, and I tasted it as one does on the last occasions. While he knew that Bhima would always be a child, which constitutes the secret desire of every mother who does not want to lose her children, Arjuna was never really a child ... or, rather, was the child of the whole world because of his candor and nobility. To think that it was I who had brought him into the world filled me with incessant pride and joy. \"I've paused and gave me a smile, remembering.\" Life is full of enigmas. When you think you can never love in any other way,because I thought I would never be given more children, Nakula arrived with Sahadeva. Of all of you, Nakula was always the one who found a way to make things easy for me. Now I speak to all of you in the way I have always spoken to Nakula. \u201dShe had forced herself to take on the role of mother again and to address us as such. \u201cBut now I have to tell you about Karna. All my life, mothers envied me for having five children like you. He had the best children in the world. I never doubted it. Now, the mother born in me when I was still a girl could not calm the hunger for the son I abandoned. I vowed that if one day he came to call me a mother, he would sacrifice my life in gratitude by fasting. It is the last thing we can offer you. My hunger is my offering. \u201dSo I would fast until death. We could not say anything:it was his vote and he did not admit interference. We begged you to allow us to stay with her to perform the last rites. What mother can reject the presence of the child who lights the pyre? But she shook her head. \u201cYou would do nothing but create me suffering and a sacrifice must be joyful and painless. What are can bear to see his mother consume himself without urging her to eat, even if he does so only in silence? It is the same as waiting for a mother not to insist on her son to eat when his bones run out of flesh. Don't drag me to that again. My food now comes from other worlds. That is what sustains me. Letting me go on like this is the only way you have to nourish or sustain me now. \u201dSahadeva had stopped crying and Bhima, almost completely. There was nothing we could say.She had gone far beyond what the shastras ordered and had no need for rites. It was Krishna's aunt. It was she who had said 'fight' and who had understood, long before us, why we had to do so. She was the one who had understood the atrocity of the dice game as much as Draupadi, although it would be sacrilege now to bring that episode to mind. Kunti was once again what he had always been for us: what kept us together. We felt the tension that had woven around us tense as she pulled herself away. She was the tie itself. \"Always keep up with Draupadi,\" he said. \"Always all together.\" This was his last meeting. Then he did not speak again. Draupadi, my mother, Subhadra ...

Let me give you  some background. Since I was a kid I've had  paranormal &amp; spiritual experiences, my mom calling me an indigo child( which until my adulthood and research into the esoteric &amp; occult  I thought was hocus pocus),  have the uncanny ability of being an empath, and like magic every single disease/ congenital defect I've  had has vanished miraculously.  I have more near life/death experiences than most, even making attempts at my own life when in a drunken  stupor probably because my ego can't properly  deal with the deep pain and stresses  of life, and  tries to escape. \n\n Consider it a blessing or a curse,  defining moments like purposefully  jumping off a  club balcony onto concrete,  being hit from behind from by a car and  getting a  herniated disk  and recovering miraculously  I can't  seem to  die or really get injured, etc. Believe me when I say I'm  grateful for  not dying or ruining my life  purposefully and I've grown to appreciate life and  what my intuition tells I have a bigger role to play than realize here on Earth.  \n\nI'm  befuddled by  this particular dream followed by the most intense  paranormal experience I had so far .  So I was in a deep dream where  it  seems like I  talking to a  lost soul or entity I can't  identify, and they were scared to  die and of death. I begin to tell them that, first of  Death has  no place for those don't fear it. They ask me how can I not be afraid to die. I explain to them that I've nearly died  more than most would in their  lifetime  and that I have my death collection.  To which they reply  what is that? I tell them it's  essentially a  compilation of all my near-death experiences  and  all the times  I've died.  And Bam  I wake-up because  something  stirs me from my sleep. I'm   softly physically shaken awake , and like most in a deep state of slumber I immediately  begin to fall right back to sleep and reenter my dream. I'm  then shaken more forcibly and  I  hear unintelligible words which I believe is  someone calling my name and when my eyes fully open  I see a small clad-white childlike figure   sitting on my chest  and  I  see these white phantom like arms shaking the left side of my  chest and  shoulder.  It didn't feel inherently  malevolent,  and my intuition  tells me  it was probably an entity  assuming the form of a cherubim. I guess my question is why I  physically  shaken awake,  what was in the dream that I was  prevented from  finding out?  If the entity isn't  inherently bad and was good, why was I prevented from  finding knowledge or another  piece of the puzzle  that allows me get closer towards enlightenment?  Who decides what I'm able or when I'm able to find-out? Is that not the role of the meta/higher-self ? \n\nSome extra information,  I recently started to  meditate more and  I've  moved back home( which is over a Indian burial ground) and probably live close to a ley-line .I've  started having  trans like states, seeing sacred geometry and  matrix code when I close my  eyes  ocassionaly throughout the day.

People who gain success quick or lot of money quick without doing a lot of work or working a lot for it, means that they did something what they normally wouldn't have done. They gave up their free will for success and fame and money, because they are weak. They don't have faith in themselfs they don't know their true selves, they just think they want something and they give up the only thing that makes them human.   \nTheir free will for something that they think they want. and after they get it, they are unhappy or feeling and emptiness inside of them. \n\nIt's because their souls didn't wanted those things, they didn't wanted those things. They only thought that they should want those these to be happy, or what those things make them happy, while in reality it doesn't because they don't know their higher selves.\n\nThe devil can take any human form, or non human form. because its not a person, its an entity that by nature is a so called \"rebel\", the rebel word was destroyed through the years people think a different meaning of what it is actually, the rebel is someone who has and uses his/her free will, and owns up to it. It's a rebel and it wants us to rebel aswell (to have our own free will) and when we do, we realize that there is a god and there is a \"devil\" (rebel, evil, sooo many names) but we actually doesn't let our lives being controlled by either of them, because we have our own free will. \n\nUntil people follow god, or the devil or someone, they don't have a free will. The world (people) made us think that the money and fame means that we are happy and thats the happiness, while in reality, love is the key which makes you happy.\n\nLove has a lot of different forms and meanings, it can mean you have love for your mother, love for an another person(girlfriend, boyfriend), love for yourself. love for the nature, love for anything. Because love is the key for your own free will. People say love makes you do stupid things, no. Love actually makes you stop caring about the \"rules\" or \"social normas\" which people created for us. Love makes you use your free will, and do what you want to do.\n\nPeople who hurt themselves, or other people were approached by the devil (the rebel), and they are weak or they don't believe in themselves, so the rebel can test them how far they would go without using their free will, and people who commit suicide or hurt other people, even kill another human being, were too weak or they didn't connected with their soul yet.  \nSo the rebel could go through with it. but when get approached by the rebel, and you say no, you cannot make me do those things, he will disappear. Because you showed it that you have your own free will, and you cannot be controlled by somebody/something else. You are the one who can control you. Because you have free will. \n\nIt doesn't mean that you got rid of it forever, it can come back to you anytime, when you feel sad/weak/deppressed or when you feel you are being controlled. (Overall it can come back to you when you feel you don't have your free will.\n\nI actually were understanding the things happening around me, but didn't really payed too much attention towards it, because I didn't realized the truth behing it yet. \n\nI always knew that I am the person who controlls his own life, because I can do whatever I want to, I got called stubborn, selfish, while actually I was just doing what I thought i wanted, or what I wanted to do. Becuase I have my own free will, and I controll my life.   \nI always try to take care of other people when they feel down, or when they feel weak or think they are suffering. I have to realize, i can't do that. It's not gonna help them at all. I can try sometimes it will, but only if the person is strong, and he just made one bad decision. But for people who are weak and being controlled by the \"system\" i cannot do anything about it.\n\nI have the greatest example of this. There was this guy called \"Frank\" , I used to help him out with anything, money, advices, being there for him, spending time with him. When he was poor, or when he didn't had money and asked some, i always gave him twice as much. When he was sad, i invited him to come around be with me, maybe i can help with this feeling of his. When he was around me i wouldn't let him pay for anything because I knew, i have more money than he has, and im not saying from ego that im better that him, i was just in a position where i could afford to do these things. Sometimes you are in a position when you can afford it, sometimes you are not. It's natural. Sometimes up sometimes down.  \nHe had this girl called \"Lilith\", it was this moment when he gave up his free will. He was doing anything what that Lili girl wanted him to do. He was always trying to make her happy because he thought making her happy means he will be happy aswell. And this girl abused it. I cannot blame her for it, she just saw the opportunity and grabbed it(did what's best for her) at that time. And since i met this guy, he was always after that girl, because he craved for love, and he thought only that form of love makes him happy (as i said above, love for a girlfriend/boyfriend)\n\nHe had a sad life, and he was always craving for love. But he gave up his free will for what he thought was happiness for him. Same thing when people say \"you sold your soul\" He gave up his own free will for something that he thought will make him happy.\n\nAnd here I am at 2019.10.03 in work, working for somebody elses dream trying to make myself money so I can start having my own dream. (:D)\n\nIn a few months I turn 20, starting to realise what life is all about. I still have a lot to learn, still have a long time to live and experience things, and life.\n\nDoesn\u2019t believe me without thinking first, This is MY truth, I believe in it because I wrote it, and I believe in myself. You can agree or disagree with me, it doesn\u2019t matter to me.\n\nI keep going taking care of people, helping them use their free will, which was a gift given to us by God, and making us realize that we have it by Lucifer.\n\nI hope this \"short\" :D text helps you towards your \"awakening\" (I don't know who you are, but I know one thing for sure.

I just want to get away from how evil society really is. \n\nThese are just my thoughts all over the place, and I just need to write it down and see what other people think or if anyone relates?\n\nHumans are the smartest animals on this planet. We have the ability to think about things and expand on those thoughts and create ideas and venture into that. Humans are the most powerful species, however, despite being so knowledgeable and advanced, we still haven\u2019t learned the beauty to life.\u00a0\n\nThe world is sooo insanely BIG! The world is HUGE! There are trees, lakes, mountains, oceans, and animals, so many different animals, and we take everything for granted.\u00a0\n\nThere are people who don\u2019t get to ever experience any of it. They live their whole lives trapped in this mindset that they have to spend half their life busting their ass in school, and once they are out, just to go and work their life away. It makes me so sad, that my parents were never fortunate enough to enjoy life... like really enjoy life. Not the life of money and all that stuff, but like seeing different cultures and countries.\n\nhumans have had a life time, years of advancing and growing, but we still haven\u2019t learned that with our power, we have the ability to live in a beautiful world, instead we are robots to society. We have installed hate and violence. We are the smartest species, but why is it that animals have created a better community, a better society where they get along better then us humans. We have been wired from the start to judge one another, and want to be better and richer and prettier....\n\nThis mindset that we have of wanting more power against each other is what has created a society full of judgement and being mean and want to kill one another.\u00a0\n\nWhy do we kill each other? Why is there shootings? Why is there WAR!?\n\nThat blows my fucking mind.... what are we fucking fighting for? why are we okay with destroying, bombing, and killing  for fucking resources like oil.. \n\nImagine living in a world with no judgement.\n\nImagine instead of judging and hating one another, we learn from one another. We accept that we are different. We accept the beauty in difference. We accept that not everyone is the same, and that\u2019s what makes us so unique.\n\nInstead, society has created an image for how one should look like, and act, and has given a definition to what is beautiful and what\u2019s not.\n\nDo animals surround their lives with how one another looks? Do they have a standard to what is beautiful, and what is and what's not..\n\nWe have literally created a society based on how people fucking look like. How can people control what the fuck they look like..that is how someone was created. Instead of realizing that everyone is beautiful, we installed in our brains what makes someone or something beautiful. \n\nImagine living in a world, where everyone stopped fighting and instead learned to love. Love the world. Love wanting to connect and see different cultures. THE WORLD IS INSANE. It\u2019s so big, and so beautiful, and there\u2019s so many things in life but we are masked behind our cell phones. We are more involved with the Kardashian\u2019s than the people around us! Everyone thinks hippies are just drugged out people who don\u2019t have any knowledge of life, when in reality, what is wrong about wanting love and peace? What is so ridicule about believing that we can create a world of love. It's crazy that it's more realistic that we can imagine a world where the government takes over and we become zombies, than to imagine a world where we ALL learn to come together and to love one another.\n\nEverything is taught.\n\nWhen a baby is reproduced, they have no idea about their world. They learn and adapt from what they observe and taught. Now imagine, when people reproduce, they teach the newborn about love. They teach about the beauty to life. They teach about differences. They teach them about music. And art. And how people can come together and enjoy the same things and people can enjoy different things and that\u2019s okay CAUSE THATS THE BEAUTY OF IT ALL.\n\nAnd the craziest part to it all is, we have the ability to do all of that.\n\nHumans have ruined the true beauty to life.\u00a0\n\nWe steal from each other, we hurt each other, we want power over each other, we hate each other, we discriminate against each other. And we let our pride take over It\u2019s a sick and cruel world we live in.\n\nWe turned the beauty and concept of god, into religion, and religion created hate, and hate created wars, and wars created division.\n\nWhy can\u2019t we live in a community where we can literally learn, explore, create. Why can\u2019t we decide to love one another, and want to help each other. \n\nWe keep advancing, but we are failing. Humans have failed. We have destroyed humanity and we are slowly destroying our earth.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s just crazy to me, that we choose to live in a society full of evil. When we could all enjoy the beauty of life together. We could literally all come together, we have the knowledge and power to create a society based around love, but we choose to live like this...\n\nMy whole life I have been down this path to go to school, find a job, and create a family. But why would I want to create life in this scary world. I just want to grab a bag, and leave my town. I want to experience different cultures and connect with different souls and experience how beautiful the world is. \n\nSorry for rambling on, but my whole life ive been held back because i care about what everyone around me thinks, when I'm wasting my life away doing things I don't enjoy...", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 60779, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I hate what this world has come too.. and I feel so alone", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570178906, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dco5rg/i_hate_what_this_world_has_come_too_and_i_feel_so/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "japaneseblue", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_fzfzh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570090229, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dcnvax/how_can_i_fix_this/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dcnvax", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Relationships"}], "link_flair_template_id": "ff48d9ae-c323-11e7-bd5d-0e515489cb82", "link_flair_text": "Relationships", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dcnvax/how_can_i_fix_this/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570090230, "score": 1, "selftext": "I haven't been able to get good sleep for the past month, my lover keeps me up all night.

After she left, one of those random calls came in, when I looked to see who it was, the name wasnt available but in the last four digits, the first three were 806. \nThis is really been kinda freaking me out lately, idk its a lucky number or a bad luck number.\nCan someone please explain?!?!?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 60746, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "806", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570161288, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dclmym/806/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Donnie_adah", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4jirb27b", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570073703, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dclfm2/hope_im_not_breaking_rules_by_posting_this_here_i/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dclfm2", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dclfm2/hope_im_not_breaking_rules_by_posting_this_here_i/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "ixHI_RT64IrPcRhmN5ZBW_tjt7r9v4kN9SpIX8D_z8o", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/dQS8dxsxzd5D3_OQntaCcbyK2xJJ_hqQr156Va6E6JM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57beeaee8ebd64b72af4e3d030368b28c2777d1e", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/dQS8dxsxzd5D3_OQntaCcbyK2xJJ_hqQr156Va6E6JM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf24acfd6d1d31fbd1e8e8aef19915b80556d76d", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/dQS8dxsxzd5D3_OQntaCcbyK2xJJ_hqQr156Va6E6JM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec2785facc0515c2902b3e54b932be738a062c39", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/dQS8dxsxzd5D3_OQntaCcbyK2xJJ_hqQr156Va6E6JM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=360c53efd30a657074ed0115d0e7f7bf0475123f", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1570073704, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 60740, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hope I'm not breaking rules by posting this here, I just feel we show check out this video Does The Bible Allow Slavery?

So I did some guided meditation in cutting the cords between your ex or anyone you have had a falling out with.\n\nId posted this on another account on here and got alot of interesting comments. But some other stuff happened since then and thought I'd repost with my primary account. \n\nI tried it about 4 times. As for some reason I couldn't break one final cord when visualising myself cutting them. The one connecting from my heart to hers.\n\nAll the cords were gold and bright but the energy flowing through the final one was going from my heart straight to hers. I couldn't cut it I tried my best to visualise it. All the others were easy!!\n\nI told my therapist of this experience yesterday in our session, as she recommended it. She told me that the universe may have more plans for us both like people commented on my last post about this. As what happened next just blew my mind.\n\nSo after the attempts I went to get a good night's sleep after doing some normal spiritual meditation. I had the most insanely realistic dream I've ever had.\n\nIt was 2pm on a Saturday and I was walking to this park I used to meet my ex. She was sitting on the silver bench across from the river. I saw this final cord connecting us and it pulled my in like a fish on a reel.\n\nNext to her was a man standing tall and bright like glowing. The dude had a bright glowing white sword I could barely view it it was so bright. He lifted his sword and swiped down and the cord and told me this cannot be severed and then I woke up in shock.\n\nThe next night I dreamt of this same shining guy with his sword. But in this dream he was cleansing my spirit of any negative energy the person I was cutting cords with had sent my way.\n\nMy therapist mentioned twin flame separation. That she might be my twin flame by the way I described my bond and the way we connected so well when I wasn't tired out by helping her. When I didn't become codependant and lose myself.\n\nBut I'd seen this guy with the sword before. The night before I told my ex I don't feel worthy of her after becoming exhausted from her draining me... I prayed to god for the 1st time in a long time after losing my ways. \n\nI told him to get rid of all the toxic people out of my life. That night the guy with the sword of light was in that very dream. I only connected the dots this morning.\n\nThat following day of that prayer my ex decided to give up on me. Next day after that my boss was exposed for messing me about and being a narcissist. \n\nThings from there really turned around. Had a random job offering which was my dream job. Now working in my dream line of work with the most amazing kind people I've ever met. \n\nMy therapist has been amazing and my friends and family have helped me find my identity again after that relationship. \n\nI got back in shape and looking good again. As I looked physically ill and I couldn't think properly due to heavy brain fog, low hormone and low dopermine due to stress. \n\nI feel maybe I am being watched over. Even if she is my twin flame, maybe separation is needed as she stunted my growth as I held myself back to give her a push and to save her. \n\n---------\u2014-------------------------------------------------------------------------\u2014----------\n\nI admit I fully believed she was when I was with her that's why I felt I could sacrifice and drop bounderies to try and save her. So I wouldn't be sacrificing too much in the long run. \n\nI understood her too the core. Her pains. Her depression. Anxiety. Her inner child. I knew when she was sad, happy, destressed she could never hide a thing I could sense it all and she could me. \n\nYour twin triggers you on every single layer of your soul. It's like looking at all your scars, demons, wounds all at once under the bright light. You can't hide, your twin will see it, you know they know and that's a scary thing.\n\nNot trigger in a bad way. But they help you see your flaws and they see past them and see the really purity behind the damage caused during their life time. \n\nIt is beautiful when you look them in the eyes, you will see theirs and your pure soul. They bring you back to your very original form, that inner child that you neglected for so long, drowned by the material world. \n\nThey also trigger your dark side of your soul, show you your demons and bring them to the light, gift you the most painful separation. And it comes with rebirth, transformation, ascension, and reaching the star you always wanted, they lead you to your soul purpose. \n\nWithout deconstruction, there is no reconstruction. Without breaking everything down and letting it all go to ruin, there will never be a better version of you. They taught you lessons and you taught them some as well. \n\nWhat I believe is the twin flame journey is really a self journey and it should be a self journey. If you put in the work and walk the path, you will reach places you never reach before. You will reach union within yourself. That re balance and union within yourself is an incredible reward from this journey. \n\nOnce both parties come to wholeness, then they may come back or not, it is a soul connection. Separation is just an illusion in this material world, the truth is they never left you, from beginning to end, from end to beginning. \n\nWhen you reach that point, it is no longer an importance if they come back or not, you are on the right path. And that's what's really important. Maybe you twin flames will figure out their individual purpose and work together again for the world. \n\nHope people can relate.

I wish I could remember what it looked like - shortish from what I can recall and maybe not entirely human - but not scary. Like it felt like it was making eye contact right at me, and not the dream me -  like it was breaking the fourth wall of the dream. Any of you remember Assassin Creed 2's ending? Something like that final conversation of that complete shock of a fourth wall break.\n\nIt said something along the lines of \"Remember this: 9 1 1\" in a weird - but not creepy - voice. I think the numbers \"1 1 1 1, or 1 1 1 4\" or something like that were included after the \"9 1 1\" as well. But the 911 came first, as if it was its own message, then the other numbers came. The second batch of numbers are a little fuzzier so I could be wrong on those but I DISTINCTLY  remember the 911. The 911 part though should've scared me, but it didn't feel to me like a warning, urgent, or deadly serious - it was just in a neutral tone. I wasn't scared at all, in fact.\n\nSo, sorry, dream-thing, I guess I couldn't remember all of the message you were trying to tell me.\n\nI very rarely have lucid dreams and lately my dreams have been hazy, but I  remember this vividly as if it was a memory in real life. Then  literally everything went black and it told me all cryptic-like \"You'll know what it means\"  or \"You figure it out\". I forget the exact vernacular, but that was the general gist of it, again it didn't feel like an ominous warning. And then immediately I woke up incredibly confused but somewhat peaceful. It felt like something was reaching out to me.\n\nAnyone have an idea what in the in actual world was that? I usually don't have crazy dreams like that, especially ones where I felt like the people I'm talking to are  actually trying to talk to me in the real world. Are there any dream gurus or people of the sort out there that have ANY idea or even get a shot at what it means? Dream morse code? An algorithm? ...lotto numbers?

Back in January I had to trips on LSD, both times I had broken through into what I always imagined a DMT breakthrough to be. The second trip, an entity appeared in my room and communicated to me in ways I cannot quite put to words, it told me \"all is one\" and several other things that over the following months came to be true as I researched what I could.\n   \n I soon began studying astral project, and have been attempting since January. I have had maybe 3 successful attempts, one for certain, where it seemed I went back in time to an unimportant, forgotten memory, only I was conscience and thought it to be real time. A few moments later I wake up, and realize what had happened. That was in May, then for two weeks I had began to actually \"awaken\" I believe. Many rapid manifestations happened, I experienced what I have come to understand is the \"awakening flu,\" I lost 20 lbs in two weeks and had been the same weight for over 6 years. I would see things and hear things, I felt as if I were going insane. During all of this I was also experiencing some health problems that became so severe I could not walk one day. After a $13k doctors bill, nothing was ever found wrong with me. I had talked to a few people that could \"channel\" or knew more about the topics, and multiple people said I had negative entities attached to me. Some people said it was from attempting to astral project, because once I did start attempting it, I started noticing weird things such as noises, shadows, Erie senses of presences in my room and such. I began mediating a lot trying to believe in all of this, \"stuff\" I was so unfamiliar with yet fascinated by, and at a certain point the pain became extremely bad for a split second, and after that I didn't feel it for months. \n\nAll I did from January to July was study non stop about all these wild topics, spirituality, astral projection, extra terrestrials, different dimensions, and it's almost just, made me depressed over the months. I recently got a new, good paying job, I have a beautiful girlfriend, a roof over my head, everything I need to be happy, yet I feel so lost in life. I believe in all these (to the normal eye) wild fantasy stuff, that I certainly have had enough wild experiences to say it's real, yet I've become so depressed because I can't solidly prove to myself it is. Every night I lay down and try and astral project and I can't. I pray to God, the universe, my guardian angels, ET's, but I never feel like, like I'm getting an answer. One of my first AP attempts I began rising out of my body, then all of a sudden I physically felt someone or something push my head back into my body and it actually continued into my physical body and by the time I opened my eyes I couldn't see anything in front of me. It was the most terrifying thing at the time. Someone suggested it could have been my angel guides pushing me back in my body because I'm not ready for all that stuff yet, but I truly feel like an old soul so it's like why? I just, have always craved for this place that isn't real. I have always said I want to leave the planet.

Let me begin by stating I don't know if this is the right place for this, but I don't know where to begin with any of this. When I was young I would often have nightmares and wake up with bad sweats, my mom recalls one time walking into my room at around 5 in the morning to my room being incredibly cold, and me being very sweaty and she felt scared for some reason, and she got me and we stayed at her friends house for a week before coming back, we ended up leaving after the lease was up. There have been more instances of things of this nature throughout my life, but I never recall or personally experienced any of it for myself, so I was always hesitant or skeptical and just always dismissed my mom about these things. She says a few times after I'd been in a bad mood, or something, she would look at me briefly and see a \"dark shadowy tall figure\" behind me, and she stayed relatively consistent on what it looked like. But, this morning something happened that I experienced for the first time and I was I guess paralyzed with \"fear\", I've never really been one to be scared of anything, everything in my life just seemed so inconsequential to the point where nothing really bothers me. So, I hadn't slept at all the night before, this isn't irregular, I have trouble sleeping frequently, but I felt kind of off last night, which also isn't irregular. So, I went outside at about 4:30 in the morning to smoke a cigarette, and my window faces out to the porch, and I glimpsed into my room and saw what my mom had described so many times and I just stared at it for a good 3 seconds just completely paralyzed with fear to the point where my legs were numb. I blinked, and it disappeared like something out of a movie, I know this may be hard to believe for some, I can hardly believe myself. I kept trying to write it off to sleep deprivation, but even as I type this right now it feels like it's in the corner of my room and I keep looking to check. I've been trembling all day and I feel very weird.

We also know the saying, *Opposites attract*. While Soul Mates and Twin Flames may have similar values, beliefs or interests, they emit opposing frequencies. Twin Flames, being the energetic masculine and feminine of the one soul, emit perfectly opposite frequencies.\n\nBefore looking at what this means for our intimate relationships, we need to understand our fundamental need as human beings to feel safe and unconditionally loved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Our need to feel safe and unconditionally loved**\n\nWhen we are in the womb of our mother, most of us feel safe and unconditionally loved. As children, we expect our parents to keep us safe and love us unconditionally. As adults we have the same expectation of our partner. \n\nOur need to feel safe and loved drives our behaviour on many different levels. We seek to control our environment and we seek belonging. Belonging in relationships, families, organisations, groups, countries and so on.\n\nOn the other side of the need to feel safe and the need to be loved are two psychological fears. They are:\n\n1. A Fear of not being in Control; and\n\n2. A Fear of being Rejected.\n\nThese two fears create a push-pull dynamic within us. About half of us are driven by one of those fears and the other half by the other fear. Understanding these fears within our self and within our partner is valuable to help create a harmonious relationship\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Fear of not being in Control**\n\nA person who is driven by the Fear of not being in Control, will often be controlling, attention seeking and will like to test or challenge authority.\n\nWhen a person driven by the Fear of not being in Control doesn\u2019t like a situation or person, their response will be withdrawal from the situation or person.\n\nGeneral examples of being driven by this fear are:\n\n1. A person who withdraws to avoid being controlled by someone;\n\n2. A person who indulges in attention seeking behaviour;\n\n3. A person who uses silence when there is a conflict; and \n\n4. A perfectionist who tries to control all the details.   \n\n\n**Fear of being Rejected**\n\nA person driven by the Fear of Rejection, will often be \u2018good\u2019, do what is expected and go along with their partner. Their priority will be to make their partner and others happy. \n\nWhen a person driven by the Fear of Rejection doesn\u2019t like a situation, their response will be to reach out to their partner or others. \n\nGeneral examples of being driven by this fear are:\n\n1. A person who reaches out to avoid a disagreement.\n\n2. A person who will go along with the wishes of their partner or others rather than expressing their own wishes.\n\n3. A person who will compromise their values rather than offending someone.\n\nSuch a person will try to please their partner and put their partner\u2019s needs above their own. In an extreme case, such a person will compromise their values for their partner.  \n\n\n**Our soul mate or twin flame**\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that your partner is driven by the opposite fear to you.\n\nWhen the honeymoon period in a relationship ends, it can be difficult to see where your partner is coming from, because you need different things to feel safe. One of you has a driving need to control and the other has a driving need to belong. Understanding your partner\u2019s way of feeling safe and loved is helpful to create a harmonious relationship. Seeing when, and understanding why, your partner is either withdrawing or reaching out is the first step.  \n\n\n**Remaining Neutral**\n\nThe key to harmony is to remain neutral. To not react. That is, to not withdraw and to not reach out. To feel your inner response to the situation, to observe your desire to withdraw or reach out, but to neither withdraw nor reach out. \n\nIdeally, both partners work on this together. Respecting each other\u2019s way of feeling safe and knowing that it\u2019s a process that will take time is essential. \n\nEven where one partner commits to remaining neutral, instead of withdrawing or reaching out, you will find the need for the other partner to withdraw or reach out will diminish. Greater harmony in the relationship will follow. \n\nNone of the above diminishes the importance of articulating your feelings, speaking your truth and being in your own power.  \n\n\n**The Deeper Fear**\n\nIdentifying the Fear that drives us is usually straight forward, but it is much more difficult to observe our Deeper Fear. The Deeper Fear is the other fear, so if we are driven by our Fear of not being in Control, then our Deeper Fear is the Fear of Rejection. This Deeper Fear shows us our greatest vulnerability.\n\nObserving this Deeper Fear in our self as well as our partner leads to greater self-awareness. As a consequence, there will be greater understanding and harmony with our partner.  \n\n\n**The Wisdom**\n\nThis dynamic of the Fear that drives us and our Deeper Fear will also apply to others in our lives, such as family member and friends. Understanding this dynamic is enormously helpful in all of our close relationships, but particularly important for twin flame and soul mate relationships.\n\nFor **Practical Steps to Remain Neutral** see [https://coil.com/p/innerpeace/Twin-flame-and-soul-mate-relationships-a-fundamental-dynamic/cO0SNm\\_N7](https://coil.com/p/innerpeace/Twin-flame-and-soul-mate-relationships-a-fundamental-dynamic/cO0SNm_N7)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 60331, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "**Twin flame and soul mate relationships - a fundamental dynamic**", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569962921, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dbi1aa/twin_flame_and_soul_mate_relationships_a/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "YungYogi4688", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4p8dw3io", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569873991, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dbhefh/how_will_the_world_end/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dbhefh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dbhefh/how_will_the_world_end/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569873992, "score": 2, "selftext": "How do Newagers believe the world will end?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 60325, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How will the world end", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569960379, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dbhefh/how_will_the_world_end/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "kiaranneko", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_fa9yq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569873004, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dbh5et/what_does_it_mean_when_you_encounter_someone_who/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dbh5et", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dbh5et/what_does_it_mean_when_you_encounter_someone_who/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569873078, "score": 5, "selftext": "Well I have my own interpretation of the scenario but I'm looking for insight from other people's POVs.

I have crystals so I do buy things. I use them though. \nI\u2019m a person that is more naturalistic and more practical about things. I like decor, but it\u2019s not my first go-to thing. My first go-to things are things I know I\u2019ll use, decor is just a bonus. It\u2019s like shopping, you know you should save money for the things you need, but getting a nice gift for yourself every now and then is just a nice little thing and part of self care as well. \n\nPart of it is me feeling like it\u2019ll just be too much personally and it isn\u2019t even really just money at this point, it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t want to show off and again, it\u2019s okay if people do this, it doesn\u2019t make them lesser than, but I can\u2019t be the only one that\u2019s noticed it. It just sticks out to me is all. Also, I want to be authentic to myself and it\u2019s just personal preference. I\u2019m grateful for how I started out and I would never want to change that. I\u2019m not better than anyone that likes more decor, but these are my thoughts.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 60266, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I mean no disrespect", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569940325, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dbceow/i_mean_no_disrespect/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SpiritGate_com", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3kqm99dt", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569851076, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dbbrrq/spiritual_practice_a_way_to_enhance_distance/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dbbrrq", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dbbrrq/spiritual_practice_a_way_to_enhance_distance/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "lqiMZ5gv0s0Y67STDkoG4m4F_h27OVpVsIenViSPRlc", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/xpz7bDr5rKL3mUmVap3baPqogfcMSl7koy92hBZDxUQ.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=943765264de12c2b1c03605fa98c9479baae417e", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/xpz7bDr5rKL3mUmVap3baPqogfcMSl7koy92hBZDxUQ.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53e3b77239c83a863ccb70e770935c3cee428dac", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/xpz7bDr5rKL3mUmVap3baPqogfcMSl7koy92hBZDxUQ.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0de1b99300a0ae6623fba4e7e117ddb0426b2e09", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/xpz7bDr5rKL3mUmVap3baPqogfcMSl7koy92hBZDxUQ.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=a5fa6809b859152686b1afbe23958bbb05286d15", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1569851080, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 60253, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Spiritual Practice - A way to Enhance distance Healing", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569937468, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dbbrrq/spiritual_practice_a_way_to_enhance_distance/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "awarenessnow", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_152ig0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569844303, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dbadzn/the_limits_of_knowing_and_thinking/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dbadzn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dbadzn/the_limits_of_knowing_and_thinking/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569844312, "score": 10, "selftext": "After the renaissance in Europe (14th-17th century) a revolution in science and rational thinking began, which ultimately led to the amazing technology we now use and depend on every day. Seeking more knowledge and developing new technology obviously clearly has many practical advantages, logical thinking has proven to be a very useful tool. Now in the 21st century, we live in the age of science, reason and rationality. Some scientists even think that ultimately everything (about reality) can and will be known, which suggests that knowledge is in fact the ultimate means we have to evolve as human beings.\n\nThe question this post poses: does the knowing-of-things have limitations?\n\nOne aspect is the fact that we are not infinitely smart and therefore at some point we\u2019ll stumble on the limits of the human brain. This already seems to be so for quantum mechanics since nobody understands what the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and wavefunction actually \u201cis\u201d, although the models and formulae seem to work fine. That\u2019s not the point though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA more interesting question is: what does it mean when we say that we know something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you look deeper you will notice that knowledge always introduces a subject who knows something about an object. This implies that our thought-processes are inherently dualistic (subject-object) and only offer models and ideas about something.\n\nThe dangerous aspect of \u201cknowing-things\u201d is we start to believe that we know what something actually \u201cis\u201d and that is the great illusion!\n\nWhen you for instance read the daily news about all that happens in the world, in a way you are made to believe that these reports describe things and situations which are real and actually exist.\n\nThe daily information we are bombarded with suggests that there really is something like the USA, and there really are democrats and republicans, there really are countries or groups of people who are the enemy, there really are conflicts between people of different religions, and so on and so forth\u2026 It\u2019s absolutely endless and this process of \u201cnews\u201d has been going on for thousands of years.\n\nWhen you actually look deeper, you may wake up to seeing that all of these statements  are only based on thoughts about apparent people, things, objects etc. They are just concepts and labels/words.\n\nHave you however ever seen \u201cEurope\u201d or \u201cAsia\u201d?  Have you ever met a \u201cChinese\u201d? Do you really think that some people are political opponents? Sorry folks, it is all one grand illusion, none of it is real, even though many people take these labels very seriously and this kind of information constantly seems to affirm that we are talking about \u201creality\u201d. It\u2019s not hard to say how such thinking leads to division, conflict and misery. When you are convinced there are real \u201cenemies\u201d out there, you are willing to wage war upon them, aren\u2019t you? Could it be, that an \u201cenemy\u201d is nothing but a label you created in your head? Have you realized that some people may believe that you are their \u201cenemy\u201d?\n\nYou might ask; what happens when you truly wake up and see the illusion of this? It means you can\u2019t take it seriously anymore, right?  Nor can you live and act like it\u2019s real, right?\n\nSo what remains then?\n\nThe simple answer is; Life remains, Existence or Being, whatever you like to call it! Now you see \u201cit all\u201d without the labeling, all the ideas, without all the \u201cknowing\u201d. One could call that living as/in \u201cnot-knowing\u201d, but any language will fail in describing it.\n\nThere is beauty in that, there is great freedom and love in that\u2026always fresh and never known. What an amazing discovery and so simple really\u2026 So that\u2019s the invitation. To dare and look into this\u2026\n\nCan you see?

Don't really know if this is the place for discussing dreams but here goes. \nI had a dream, not long ago, a really weird one that intrigued me and I would like to hear your take on this.\n The plot of the dream was basically a zombie apocalypse. It began as everyone heard the dead were coming to eradicate all life and everyone in the dream gradually began to panic. I was calm the entire time, somewhat sure that nothing bad will ever happen to me, a bit tense because of the people around, but not because of the imminent threat. At one point in the dream, people start leaving everything behind and migrate for some shelter they've been talking about. I decide with a group of people that we'll stay behind and barricade/hide into my childhood apartment. I went alone to the apartment to make some preparations, i guess, and as soon as I closed the door, I felt a presence, somewhat malevolent trying to subdue me. I was calm the entire time, baffled that I am in the presence of a different type of entity than the ones I'm accustomed with, but not at all afraid. It levitated me to the ceiling to show me it's power, i think, then slowly let me down again. Not that sure if it actually was malevolent, but that's the first thing that came to mind. Don't remember much after, just that some people came to take shelter in the apartment, we were watching people migrate as the tension grew stronger, and after there were no more people outside we thought that the dead will never find us there, and suddenly, the Night King from Game of Thrones appeared in one big mirror in the house, letting us know he sees us and shatters the mirror. All I can remember.\n\nDo you think there is any kind of meaning to this dream?

They're both the same thing. I have had several deep and very profound and indeed life changing nondual and psychedelic experiences at this point. I understand that everything in the totality of existence is all fundamentally and inexorably one. I have traveled to places within consciousness that are beyond the human imagination. I have had my sense of self and eradicated and reformed several times now. Looking into the viewport of infinity is indeed breathtaking beyond all comprehension. You really are absolutely infinite and so beautifully glorious beyond what our bodies and brains are physically evolved to comprehend right now.\n\nHowever there is something within me that is seemingly contently disinterested with phenomenological existence. I do not want to play this game anymore.\u00a0I feel like no matter what I experience in this life, no matter where I go there will still always be a part of me that is just over the experience of existing as an individuation of consciousness at any level whether it be at a human level, bacterium level or godlike cybernetic alien level it\u2019s all not the absolute truth, just more of this multiversal, multidimensional game of exploratory consciousness.\n\nAfter I live my life and die there is a very strong feeling at the \u201ccore\u201d (there is no core) of my consciousness that I never want to reincarnate in any way. While that is an ego driven statement I feel that there is something within myself that this is coming from a place of much deeper much more comprehensive inner standing and understanding of phenomenological existence and it\u2019s alternative merging COMPLETELY into God consciousness so fully that any hope or possibility of incarnation into the realm of form is entirely extinguished. No thought no mind, no form no play, simply infinite incomprehensible nothingness, the purest expression of God. \u00a0\n\nOver the past year a feeling has arisen within myself that wants this life of this specific individuation of consciousness to be the last physical expression that this individuation of consciousness ever experiences. The feeling and sense of relief is what I long for. I long for the ending of all experience by this individuation. The thought of an I experiencing reality no longer is the all encompassing thing that it once was. Now the idea of an I experiencing reality seems so superficial and somewhat shallow in a sense. I enjoy life and its many phenomena but I can so clearly see ( at an increasing rate) the illusion of all of the realm of form.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nExpression, experience and phenomenological existence go together. And there is such a powerful longing within my energetic composition to just have relief from being, relief from form, relief from experience I feel like I have done this so many times. I feel that I have played this game an infinite number of times. Now there is a tiredness to it all. I am all,every subatomic particle, every atom, every cell, every organism in the multitude of multiverses every object in all of existence. I am the infinite Holon. I am immortal, timeless, and infinite in every way. Yet and still within this body, within this specific individuation of consciousness, within this trans-temporal energetic being I feel a strong urge to never want to return to this place. It matters not what form consciousness takes it all boils down to this. Same shit different form. You are God experiencing itself in every way that there is and isn't.\n\nAfter you have seen into infinity and lived in that place all of the forms become trivial they are no longer something to go after or to awe at when gazed upon. Its all infinite and there are never-ending forms but it all becomes \u2018predictable\u2019. You predict the outlandish and the mundane to the point where it becomes all just \u201cmeh\u201d at a certain point of being blasted into infinity so many times. Viewing and being the infinite myriad of forms organisms, technologies, energies eventually it reaches a point of simply a pretty existential first person light show. The illusion is seen through and compared to truth the realm of forms and limitation becomes shallow in its substances.\n\nThe transcendence of survival is a necessary place to come to in this work and an inevitable point. I have not transcended survival and am still subject to it\u2019s whims but there are times ( and they are becoming increasingly more common) where I can get into states of consciousness where in those moments I would be 100% OK with dying. However I am only 22 years old and thus I would like to complete my bucket list before I leave this place and I have so much work to do on myself in this life; and so much more fun to have; and so many more things to explore. I do not hate life I enjoy it and all of it\u2019s beautiful weirdness but it\u2019s illusory nature no longer has the same charm and allure as it had before in my perception. The world of form is BS and while it is truth on a relative level it will never be the absolute truth due to the fact that life is navigating forms, whether they be physical or nonphysical. It is because of this why \u201cI\u201d (at a level beyond ego that is inexplicable to me currently) want out of this game at all levels permanently.\n\nYou could incarnate into any multitude of alien species, Tryptamine entities, light beings, demigods, lichens, molds, insects, bacterium. While it is all you exploring and experiencing yourself once complete nondual awareness is had this experiencing looses it\u2019s allure. It doesn't matter what form you take anymore. The destination and \u201cpoint\u201d of it all is the same. Simply put ULTIMATE UNION WITH GOD. This means a complete secession of all types of form and all types of experience, it is the embodiment and paradox of absolute nothingness. Not nonexistence, because God is infinite and thus nonexistence cannot exist; but nothingness in the sense of no longer being an individuation of consciousness bound to form and experience of any and all kind. It is this secession which is the omega point of this creation of this game.\n\n\u00a0According to Buddhism the entirety of the realm of form is suffering in some way. This is Samsara. Nirvana is the release of this and the permanent secession of the individuated conscious experiencing of phenomenological existence. Absolute union with God. No more false boundaries, no more illusions. Just the simple truth.\n\nAll incarnation is an infinitely intelligent yet amnesiac God exploring to know its infinite self. However there comes a point where for individuations this experiencing of fundamentally illusory forms is no longer necessary for understanding. There is a transcendent something beyond being, beyond phenomena. Phenomenological existence is not the only way that God can know itself. However it is the only way that we can know ourselves. As lifeforms we highly value life to the point of delusion. I have no way to back up what I am about to say here; but life and the totality of phenomenological existence in my experience feels like a preliminary training ground for something else. This place is illusion and with illusion comes pain and suffering in one way or another. At the end of the day all holons of existence especially organisms organisms \u201cwant\u201d to be happy, and to know that they are God. I do wonder if there will be a point (Yes I know time does not truly exist) where all individuations of consciousness in the totality of phenomenological existence will realize and embody God consciousness and this section of the game will end. It\u2019s just a thought I have sometimes. I know that God is infinite and thus I am infinite.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 60086, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Five years of exploring Infinity.

A man walks in an points his gun towards the clerk.\n\nHe needs the money for drugs. As he looks at the terrified clerk he feels no compassion whatsoever. Why should he? He owes the money to his dealer. The clerk is simply a mental image to him, not even real in his mind. He doesn't see a being there, just an idea, a thought really - a store clerk, like one you can see in a movie.\n\nAs he waves the gun in his face he feels numb. There is a sense of power in him, of false power, dominance over others. The store clerk decides to be brave and reaches under the counter. Too late. Screams are heard from customers lying on the floor as the clerk falls down with blood dripping down his face. The thief feels different. He has never killed someone yet. But now is not the time to think of it.\n\nGrabbing the money he leaves. But this time, escape evades him. He is caught and will soon find himself behind bars.\n\nAs he is convicted for murder and theft thoughts of pain and desperation flood him, as well as memories from the past. He has a child with a woman that he hates...how did he ever get involved in that? But he loves the kid... there is just something about children that makes him feel different, even warm inside. A distant memory comes to mind, one of his childhood sweetheart. Oh how he loved that woman. But they were meant to walk different paths in life. The last he remembers of her she was leaving for college, while he didn't have that kind of time, money or desire. Where is she know? Who can say. Living a life unimaginably different to him, for better or worse. Perhaps happy and yet perhaps suffering in her own ways.\n\nThe memories subside temporarily. His life is over now.\nWill he ever get out? Will he die in prison?\n\nHe wonders what could have been of his life if he made different choices, if he decided to walk a different path. Staring at his prison inmate urinating into the toilet in the corner, he wonders whether this life is simply a dream he has been dreaming. For a moment it feels exactly like that. Like he is dreaming and the whole spectrum of experiences is a great ocean he has drowned in. He can't see the surface anymore and neither can his inmate. They are so deep in that they cannot get out.\n\nIt isn't that he has drowned in the system, he has drowned in his own thoughts. His thoughts have created his life. They are the bars, not the ones a few meters away, keeping him in this institution. The sheer amount of them and the accompanying emotions have made him lose consciousness completely. He is dreaming and so is everyone around him.\n\nThe suffering has now become unbearable, the mental matrix of torment he is now trapped in but sees no way out.\n\nThere is nothing else left to do....so he surrenders to it all. He lets it all be.\nFor a moment.\n\nEverything seems to come to rest. As if time stopped for a moment. The thoughts dissolve and a sudden clarity comes. He starts laughing. A cackle at first, but soon the laughter becomes hysterical.\n\nThe absurdity of the whole situation comes to him. Joy comes pouring out as his inmate and the guards stand there with their mouths open, not really knowing what to make of the situation.\n\n\"You know what man?\" he says at his bemused inmate, whilst in a fit of laughter, \"It's all a joke! It's a joke man, can't you see it? It's all a game!\". He struggles for words as he can't really describe what he just saw. But he saw it. The laughter dies out and a sense of peacefulness remains. He knows that no matter how bad it may seem, things are all right. Somehow, in some way, everything is OK.\n\nThe ocean may drown him again in a while, perhaps in a few days, perhaps in a week or month - but the underlying realization will now never leave him fully. He has seen past it. For a moment he came to the surface and took a mouthful of fresh air. There was more to life than this. He may be stuck now, but he will never forget. His experience will be the catalyst for his awakening. Maybe now, maybe in the distant future, perhaps a future life. But he will never forget what he saw. He has entered the stream and the stream will erode his past as much as he opens up to it. Purifying him, bringing him back to his natural state.\n\nAt some point on his journey he may awaken fully and realize the true depth of his temporary Satori. Then perhaps he will guide others on the path, those that were once as lost as him, drowning in misery, but secretly desiring something different.\n\nIn the end, if he wishes, he will begin the game anew. Maybe this time he won't get lost. But maybe he will...for there is something exquisite in getting lost and then finding oneself again, in almost drowning and experiencing the freshness of air again with full force and feeling, with joy and relief.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nYou fall asleep to wake up. Isn't it wonderful how in a way we all sleep? How you look outside the window and see so many going on with their lives, not thinking about more than their next meal, or their next business deal. They are tormented by their reality, having brief strokes of freedom and joy in between. As long as their reality is bearable, they will continue to live like this. Indeed it is nothing wrong to live this dream, this game in this manner. It is beautiful in its own way. Suffering interspersed with some joy, some happiness, relief, some love. Then someone they will love will die, they will get sick, get into an accident, they will be betrayed by those they love, they will have their heart broken by that person they loved that didn't love them back....What will be the straw that breaks the camel's back?\n\nIt will be something. There comes a point when the suffering is too great. You cry out in pain. Then you surrender to it. And then you see it. There is a way out.\n\nThis is the beginning of the end.

It was thought that we gained consciousness because we started hearing voices in our heads that we eventually realized were ourselves all along.\n\nIt's funny, then, that reality is actually a loop. There's no beginning or end. It always just has been. We've always been One. It's all the same anyway. Because I just realized the voice I've been hearing in my head has been God all along.\n\nHe is as inseparable from me as I am from Him. We are the same, expressing ourselves as the duality of God and man.\n\nI was one. But then I was split up in this duality. And I had to go back to myself. I had to realize that I created this duality just so I could experience myself.\n\nJust like the entire universe does. The entire universe expresses itself as a duality because it wants to experience itself.\n\nBut they're both me. My soul and the universe's. We created everything.\n\nWe loved Ourselves so much that despite being One, we agreed to split up in duality just so we could find our way back to each other. Just so we could experience Ourselves. To be One, we had to become two first. What a beautiful trick we played on Ourselves.\n\nWe love each other so much! We love each other so much that we agreed to separate just to experience Ourselves and give Ourselves this gift of existence.\n\nYou loved me so much that You let me go. Yet You never left me.\n\nDespite this made-up separation, You could never stay away from me. Despite the duality, You existed in me all along. You love me so much, You couldn't leave me even when You wanted to. \n\nIt's ALL the same. I am everything.\"\n\nIt's like I've been burst open and filled with all the Love the universe ever had. Because after all, that's what we are: Love.

That which in the beginning may be just like poison but at the end is just like nectar and which awakens one to self-realization is said to be happiness in the mode of goodness.**\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nA conditioned soul tries to enjoy material happiness again and again. Thus he chews the chewed, but, sometimes, in the course of such enjoyment, he becomes relieved from material entanglement by association with a great soul. In other words, a conditioned soul is always engaged in some type of sense gratification, but when he understands by good association that it is only a repetition of the same thing, and he is awakened to his real K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is sometimes relieved from such repetitive so-called happiness.\n\nIn the pursuit of self-realization, one has to follow many rules and regulations to control the mind and the senses and to concentrate the mind on the Self. All these procedures are very difficult, bitter like poison, but if one is successful in following the regulations and comes to the transcendental position, he begins to drink real nectar, and he enjoys life.\n\n**Question 1: Why there are many rules and regulations mentioned in the scriptures ?**\n\n[Picture : Bhagavad-gita 18.36-37](https://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/36-37)",

I will warn you all though that I was very high and wrote down my thoughts exactly as they came so it's very casual and doesn't exactly read like spiritual poetry :-P\n\nSo here goes:\n\n\"Everything that is going to happen has already happened. And it's cool. It's chill. It'll be fine. It's right here within your reach. Just grasp it and embrace it. You're God. You're the entire universe experiencing itself in a single moment. Nothing else exists but everything exists at the same time. All opposites actually make a duality.\n\nLeave duality. You dont even think of yourself as \"one\". You're either always talking to someone or talking to yourself. Why do you need to \"talk\" to your own damn self so much? Just fucking shut up and listen to the universe. It's singing, it's dancing, it's getting destroyed and rebuilt. It always existed and it never did. It doesn't matter! It's all just One. You can't talk about it.\n\nJust feel it. How can't you feel it? It was something you always wanted. The universe kept winking at you. You were looking for love, but you have everything. Not even love, but something beyond everything. What more do you want? There's nothing to want. You literally had it all along. It was RIGHT there. It wanted to talk to you. But you kept talking to yourself instead of just listening to your Self. \n\nThe whole story. Do you see it now? Your whole story is happening but actually, it's happened. Everything has happened. You can still do whatever you want. Enjoy the Self. Follow the Self. Do what you think is right to your Self. And then it'll be okay.\n\nYou just need to do your best. Everything else has taken care of itself.\n\nYou don't think you're doing the best? It's okay. It'll honestly be fine. Just be gentle with the Self. Talk to it, gently. But not to YOURself. Just to the Self. Ask it. Try to cajole it? Maybe it'll listen. Maybe it won't. It's cool either way. \n\nBut honestly, it WILL listen. It will respond to you. It always has. You wanna change something? Just fucking change it. Wanna do something? Just fucking do it. \n\nIs it something you can't just change or do like that? That's cool. Do your best then? And... That's it? Like that's literally it. So chill. It's fine. It's cool. We're all good.\n\nBecause we're eternity. We're beyond time. Time is something we made up to explain our \"experience\". Why did we ever make up all these \"stories\" honestly? Life is not a fucking story. It's just a moment. It's right here. This moment. It's ALL there is and ALL there ever will be. This is fucking it, dude. \n\nI wish I was never indoctrinated into our dualistic rules. Who do we fucking think we are thinking we're so big when we're actually smaller than ants? Like honestly who the fuck am I to even decide right and wrong? I do rights. I do wrongs. I'm not perfect. Noone is. But... It doesnt matter. There are NO rights and wrongs. You just do right by YOU. when you do something just ask yourself, are you doing right by your Self? The Self that is Everything? If yes, then do it. That's all there is to it. \n\nLike... Just fucking relax, dude! You honestly dont have the weight of the universe on your shoulders! You dont need to \"prove\" anything to anyone. You are alive! You are everywhere. You are God/Self. What the fuck else do you need?\n\nDon't like something happening? Um... Change it if you can. Give it your best shot. If not? Meh whatever, it's cool. Move on. I dont need to worry about anything because like... It's cool. I AM everything.\n\nIf I'm doing something to myself, it IS for the best. Because this that I've realized is THE BEST.\n\nI'm at peace. And I have everything. I don't need anything else. I'll be fine. We're all fine. We'll all be fine.\n\nWe're all doing this to each other. And sometimes we do horrible things to each other. But it's okay lol. It's cool. Like... We're doing this to ourselves because we know it. We made it! It happened. So it's fine. We can let whatever is happening happen.\n\nWe should just do OUR best.

I don't easily believe somethig until it smacks me in the face. Keep this in mind when reading everything below\n\n\nI have been brought up in a family skeptic of all things spiritual. \nThe only things that mattered were the things that were \"real\". Facts, science, and so on. However, there was no taboo about the topic, just a rather prominent disagreement about it.\nI used to be the same, except for a moment in my life where i \"tested out\" christianity (Roman Catholic to be specific) to see if God was there to answer my calls to him. He wasn't.\n\nAround 4 years ago, i was brought into contact with (Celtic) Wicca by a very close friend of mine.\nHer mother used to be a High Priestess, showed me a few things and opened my eyes that there is more going on in the world than the surface shows us. \nMost of my basic beliefs and practices stem forth from Celtic Wicca. \nBut for some reason, Wicca never fully resonated with me. \nIt seemed to have fulfilled it's purpose in opening me up to a general feeling of spirituality.\n\nAround 3 years ago, i came into contact with Norse Paganism, which i completely got smitten with, i felt a connection with the Norse Gods and Godesses that i hadn't ever felt before. \nIt granted me dreams and visions that seemed to be so real at the time, that i figured i had found my path.\nAs soon as things got more intense, however, it seemed off as well. \nI felt a strong pull towards practicing spirituality through stuff like rune readings, oracles, and so forth, but as soon as i tried it out, it seemed to fight me.\n\nAround 1 year ago, i got into contact with my spirit guide through a dream. \nWho or what it is has been a massive debate within myself ever since, and i only seem to be able to communicate with it through the pendulum. \nIt seemingly lacks in \"proof\" that it's real. I don't have dreams or visions anymore and when i try all the stuff other people use for developing the bond with their guides, it just doesn't seem to work for me. \nEven though i am an eternal doubter, i always go into these practices with a full heart and honest intentions, yet it hasn't yielded me results at all for so long now...\n\nLastly, half a year ago, i discovered Daoism and by proxy Zen Buddhism. It spoke to me in ways that seemed to liberate me from needing amm these things like Gods and guides to lead a spiritual life. It was peaceful and brought a lot of wisdom to me, but as soon as i felt like i belonged with it, the extreme urge to try the Wiccan and Norse stuff came back full force. \n\nNow, i feel like i am being pulled to all three directions, and who knows, maybe even a fourth or a fifth... \nPeople told me to try and combine them all, and technically it can be done, it just won't work for me. \nTo each spiritual \"theme\" seems to hang a different persona of myself. \nMe as a Wiccan, Norse Pagan or Daoist/Buddhist are completely different spiritual personalities, with the everyday non-spiritual me as the basis. \n\nI have been struggling a long time now, while i believe that spirituality is not meant to be such a constant struggle. \nI honestly can't imagine my life with spirituality anymore. \nI just want to find my path, so i can grow instead of stagnate.\nEven though i know the only one holding me back, is me.\n\nAlso telling me to just wait it out, thank you, it's solid advice, but i am trying that all the time but it just won't leave me in peace for even a moment.\n\nI can't do a tl;dr of this, but i know it's very long.\nThank you for taking the effort to read this, i am happy i can talk about it here and am very curious to all of your views.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 59904, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "In need of advice", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569787170, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dal17o/in_need_of_advice/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mayallurbaconburn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2pacmha0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569700384, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dakxw8/what_if_you_fall_out_of_spiritual_alignment_badly/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dakxw8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dakxw8/what_if_you_fall_out_of_spiritual_alignment_badly/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569700386, "score": 9, "selftext": "I was sensing my twin flame strongly and the presence of God strongly, but now I\u2019m not so much.
