I've mainly looked at Sikhism (born into it), Christianity, Buddhism, Yoga, Stoicism, Law of Attraction related ideas, Tantra, a little bit of the massive field of the occult and currently Taoism. \n\nOut of these I've really resonated with Buddhism. I like the plethora of information, literature and modern sources for practice which are available, as well as a wide range of instruction and exercises. My problem however is with the asceticism and renunciation of relationships and active social work it preaches, plus the pacifism. On this note I still love Sikhism for its embracing of the worldly (or householders) life, encouraging being actively engaged in the world while remaining detached from our vices, material objects and other people - however beautiful I find the faith though, it lacks clear instruction in how to fully live our life (except for the stress on devotion and love for God through doing the prayers and helping others) and in its modern phase it's got too much ritual and fuzzy beliefs which the mainstream practitioners treat as true and unquestionable. \n\nI want to live within this world, helping in making some kind of difference through my work and relationships, at least in the lives of those closest to me. However, I also work towards ensuring I'm grounding my actions within a spiritual/philosophical framework that supports my goals. So far I've taken what I can from different studies, sikhism has taught to always live to help myself and anyone in need, buddhism has aided this to an extent but most valuable from it has been the practice of meditation and mindfulness, which has helped me get a better hold on stress and learn to relax properly. Yoga (the physical exercises) helps me to remain healthy and reduce stress/exhaustion. Law of Attraction/Manifestation Techniques (still not sure if they're real or just my placebo) have helped me in my new career and tantric sex has helped me approach sex with my partner in a more spiritual way. \n\nI am on my way to set up for myself a framework which helps me live a life to my truest potential, but I'd like to know if there are others who have written on this matter, or spoken about it so that I can learn more. I want to cut down on my time researching on all different paths so I can focus on other matters at hand, so I can stick with one or few sources to refer repeatedly to, because sometimes I get frustrated with not being able to find just the one way of life/spiritual path which can aid me, someone who speaks the language I can really relate to. I've just found a book called \"The Urban Monk\" which looks like it might be what I'm looking for and would love to get suggestions on other sources of a similar idea to work with! I'm also studying Taoism, which appears to be quite a suitable philosophy not unlike what I'm looking for. However it's kinda hard to find a lot of information on it but I'm reading the Tao Te Ching at least and going to look into Inner Alchemy and it's view on how practice sexual relationships.\n\nI don't mean to insult anyone's practice, but I'm just trying to figure out what I find is right for me. Anyway, hopefully that all wasn't too confusing. Thanks if you took the time to read it. If you have any suggestions for what/who else I could look into that'd be great.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 59884, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "Spiritual paths/philosophies/books/other sources which don't advise renunciation and help the modern working person?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569776004, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/daijcm/spiritual_pathsphilosophiesbooksother_sources/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "arii19", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1uabqpya", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569687495, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dai2ov/new_age_spiritualitychristian_hybridity/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dai2ov", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 18, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dai2ov/new_age_spiritualitychristian_hybridity/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569688139, "score": 4, "selftext": "Basically I\u2019m curious for those of you on here who practice both \u201cnew age\u201d spirituality (a blanket term I suppose for a lot of the types of spirituality that are discussed here) and practice Christianity in some form: how do you strike a balance between the two?

He inspired me big time, so I was really happy to see he was still training and in the country, he\u2019s a former professional 7 times world champion full contact kickboxing. Anyway... started training with them all again and I started feeling more confidence, I also have noticed that I view the world differently now. That will be from training with them for two years now, right? But it feels like I\u2019m reverting back to an older way which I used to see the world. I used to always see \u201ccute\u201d in people and the world, and now I see it again. It\u2019s mostly with tough people. \n\nFor example, there\u2019s this girl who works at the coffee shop and she\u2019s a recovering crack addict. I have befriended her and have trained with her because she\u2019s just started kickboxing and also been a few walks with her and stuff. I want to help her on her path to recovery! She\u2019s cool... but sometimes I say things and she looks at me as if to say \u201cwtf are you on about\u201d and I find this cute. It\u2019s like, I find her toughness cute. \n\nThis happens often, everyday, I just see the world, people, things, things people do, as cute. \n\nWhat is this all about?

According to hindu mythology, they are the seven stages of energies through which human body can be transformed into META bodies or human beings into future beings.\n\nIn vedas, there has been uncountable mentions of awakening the seven chakras in medieval times (around more than 4000 years ago). Like lordshiva , Ashwasthama (from the mahabharata) etc.\n\nSo basically , the chakras are the passage or gateway for the conservation of energies from the universe. Which is almost similar to the chinese conception to the \"chi\" or \"the energy force\" (\u6c23).In which the energies of the universe is transferred into human bodies by some physical exercise.\n\nWell in hindu mythology , the description of chakras is descibed as the serpent which is coiled and rest inside our human body somewhere between our lumbar region and the base of spine. When the awakening of this serpent happens , this serpent crawls spirally through the lower most root chakra to the higher most crown chakra.\n\nBeing a hindu and a student of ayurveda medical sciences and surgery , In my opinion hindu religion and mythology describes things in a poetic ways by using several metaphorical instruments. For example in the above text the coiled serpent refers to the energy which is contained in that region. And by several ways we can control its awakening and movement of the energy from root to crown chakra.\n\nEnergy chakras are present in all living organism whether it is a tree or a dog. As we here we are talking about human beings, so there are seven chakras in our human body .\n\nThe seven chakras of our human body are as follows (from top to bottom) -:\n\n1.MULADHARA CHAKRA (THE ROOT CHAKRA)\n\n2.SVADHISTHANA CHAKRA (THE SACRAL CHAKRA)\n\n3.MANIPURA CHAKRA (THE NEVAL CHAKRA)\n\n4.ANAHATA CHAKRA (THE HEART CHAKRA)\n\n5.VISHUDDHA CHAKRA (THE THROAT CHAKRA)\n\n6.AJNA(THE THIRD-EYE CHAKRA)\n\n7.SAHASRARA (THE CROWN CHAKRA)\n\nThere are two types of awakening of chakras -:\n\nA. Controlled awakening of chakras (1 in a million) \n\nB. Uncontrolled awakening of chakras (rare but not that rare)\n\nLet us assume if someone awakens his chakras in a controlled manner. He/she can do everything that is considered impossible for human beings. Like from reading minds (telepathy) to moving objects without touching them (telekinesis). He/she can control ageing or in other words a step before immortality. \n\nConsidering point (A), how many of us has seen superheroes like marvel/DC universe in real life? Yeah! None of us\u2026 as it is a very rare activity. \n\nBut if we consider point (B), uncontrolled awakening does occurs in real life. Uncontrolled awakening can be dangerous or may even lead to death. As the amount of energy and power human body generates and receives is way too much for the body, as it is not prepared it. \n\nIt is a fact many people dies while awakening because they don\u2019t know the actual process.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 59838, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "WHAT ARE CHAKRAS?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569742256, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dacyqi/what_are_chakras/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Ninetrey1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2u2t5ywr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569650513, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dac8wl/new_energy/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dac8wl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dac8wl/new_energy/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569650514, "score": 3, "selftext": "New moon coming.. any synchronicities or experiences you\u2019ve had lately worth nothing??", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 59825, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New energy", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569736890, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dac8wl/new_energy/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "R3volutionzz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2wbm80v9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569646984, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dabqvd/hello_hi/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dabqvd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dabqvd/hello_hi/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569646984, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello spirit friends.

It looks like the more people believe in something, the more emerges a bubble that gets more and more charge, until the contents of the bubble begin to become real. and by this i think i stumbled across the secret to how magic works. get as many people as you can to belief in something you want to create until it manifests.\n\nthe following is my personal assumption about why this is.\n\nif there has always been nothing in existense, which would be expected, there has automatically always been everything. everything is contained in zero. because as long as you have negative and positive \"numbers\" that go to infinity, it remains zero. so there is actually nothing. and therefore everything.\n\nif there's everything, there is also something that realizes that it's there. conciousness. if theres everything, there is also consciousness that can play with everything and experience it. of course it would want to, it would be quite boring otherwise.\n\nand this is us. we are nothingness polarized into awesomeness, divided into partitions to experience itself. we can create and change things, but limited, because we are not the only partition whose belief creates the experience. but knowing makes a difference.\n\nTL;DR: because there was always nothing there was always everything. we are the part of everything that creates experiences.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 59742, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "what making crop circles and being in a cult taught me about reality", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569702966, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/da6602/what_making_crop_circles_and_being_in_a_cult/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "PeacekeeperAlex", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_yjmr0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569616279, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/da63jk/alex_james_hislop_dairy_entry_content_09192019/", "gildings": {}, "id": "da63jk", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "r/psychic"}], "link_flair_template_id": "332a7086-675e-11e9-b0e5-0ef6645d06a8", "link_flair_text": "r/psychic", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/da63jk/alex_james_hislop_dairy_entry_content_09192019/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "eaSNs5tA7QuniO6q_lFUxmdSyvCN-5eM3vy_GvpvSIc", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/yLIfYR5AVhgetcxKjNUIDwMcsD7hZIX_MfecKBZMO1A.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee33477370a95fe85d609c532e4123461b4b3074", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/yLIfYR5AVhgetcxKjNUIDwMcsD7hZIX_MfecKBZMO1A.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb89585e295cf672849f35858218ce92a630b05a", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/yLIfYR5AVhgetcxKjNUIDwMcsD7hZIX_MfecKBZMO1A.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7603106324409ca67e4acd4c0d2302b7350c2c6", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/yLIfYR5AVhgetcxKjNUIDwMcsD7hZIX_MfecKBZMO1A.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=a31985529cfd8d8a1cc94690c6e31c45729e7106", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1569616281, "score": 1, "selftext": "This is a Psychic Diary Entry that I have been doing for over a year now talking about some of my experience and psychictivity that I am experiencing.

Free and fun-loving is what some might point towards and living with care and kindness within our lives can be a loving way to live. This is not just a starting point but rather a home for how we want to operate at times. There is also potentially a literal mentality energy in regards to that of love pertaining to the overlapping layers on our head area in which is sometimes discerned by psychics and things of that nature. There is many other kinds of compositions and machinisms of love but one of the most important I feel is that of the Emotion of Love in which some of us have been able to identify in regards to falling in love. That warm loving feeling in the chest area and heart centre in which is a partial indicator that one is in love.\n\n**An emotion?**\n\nThe Emotions that we feel in our Heart Centre and Emotion Area is potentially a stimuli that tells of the spiritual around us. We feel and experience emotions daily which lets us know that we are more than flesh and blood and that we potentially have a soul. It\u2019s one of the things that spiritualists can point towards in a scientific way that can lament upon learning in which you are going through in regards to Spiritual Education. The Science of Anatomy will potentially reveal in the future what spiritualist of today are letting know of in the communities that have emerged partially by way of the connection that the internet has created as well as connectedness of nature. Emotions I feel are part of Nature and that myriads of different informations out there letting know of other kinds of stimuli as well that could potentially be considered nature as well.\n\n**What exactly is an emotion?**\n\nWe experience emotions potentially in multiple kinds of ways but the main way that even the average person on this planet discerns the stimuli of emotions is that of feeling and some might point towards touch in which I feel could be considered but the utilization of the word feeling potentially points as well at times to the multi use that spirit employs in regards to certain words in which we use. Feeling almost laments upon another describer word that we use in which explains another kind of sense we have partially in regards to being able to sense emotions. We feel emotions and potentially touch emotions in a certain kinds of way. Visually how amazing would that be if the Spirit World was looking upon Emotions similar to how they look upon physicals. It speaks of how the different perceptions pertaining to sense and what exactly we are. That there could be life within emotion itself is a possibility I have noticed through my own psychic research, spiritual communications and experiences\n\n**What kinds of emotions are there?**\n\nImagine the composition and colour of physicals and other-dimensional beings impacted upon certain actions. That spiritually we could change colour based upon certain energy promotions in which even the energy promotion compositions themselves could potentially be affected upon the action themselves. Even moods could be impactful in regards to how we sense certain kinds of energies. The colour and composition of emotions being impacted at times in regards to the kinds of emotions we create and the thought that we are feeling certain kinds of emotions by our mood. So there are potentially multiple kinds of emotions that look and feel certain kinds of ways based upon many different factors, one in which has to do with the kind of emotion one is creating. Perception labels sadness to be blue and Happiness Yellow but the there are potentially many different colours associated with the different kinds of emotions.\n\n**What exactly does it feel like?**\n\nMany different kinds of stimuli. There is a lot of different kinds of feelings associated with the kinds of senses that we are able to experience in regards to that of emotion. From the breathlessness of fear to the high pitch illumination of Joy, the sorrows of despair to the mourning of sadness. To be able to describe some of these experiences without having to use the literal words in which it is trying to describe can be difficult especially since we use those very words to describe other kinds of things within life. We know it to exist by way of how we experience emotions and it is one of those senses in which has been described and understood in ways in which can seem kind of crazy that we don't fully know the metaphysics behind emotions especially in regards to how we have approached emotion in regards to the scientific communities. This speaks though of the glitch within the system especially in regards to some equating seemingly lack of proof that we have spirit when it partially lies within emotional research. Even describing some of the emotions that exist to regular folk sparks remembrance and understanding in ways in which let know that emotions exist.\n\n**What exactly does it affect?**\n\nWe as physical beings on this planet experience emotion to a certain degree as to acknowledge it\u2019s existence but what exactly is it? Analyze the emotions in which you feel daily and you may become more aware of the truth that exists behind those emotions. As a Psychic-Medium I have come to the believing factors that there is life within emotion. That the emotions that we create impact other kinds of spiritual entities behind the scenes in ways in which would make us pay more attention to our emotions. I have come to the believing factors that there is life within emotion through my own experiences. That the emotions that we create impact other kinds of spiritual entities behind the scenes in ways in which would make us pay more attention to our emotions. Affecting relationships and mentality, behaviour and personality upon emotional utilization. For some it might affect the setting and interaction in regards to ourselves. Again, seen within Near Death Experience tells of how in certain dimensional existence they can feel emotions to a heightened degree. The imaginings of being able to feel some of our emotions to such a degree especially the negative ones can give one a clue to the kinds of affect it can have on spiritual entities within radius of some of those emotions. For some realms the emotional climate of person might be weather patterns seen in the sky. It's makes one think about when we look up at the skies and the kind of weather systems we a re experiencing could be the mood atmospherics of the planet. Either way emotions affect many different things and it's not just in a visual sort of way but just as how we perceive emotions to be in an extra sensory sort way knocks upon the door that there are many different kinds of senses in which some spirits are perceiving emotions.\n\n**Is there a difference between feeling emotion and creating it?**\n\nYes, although just because we feel emotions throughout our life doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t creating those emotions as well by way of different spiritual mechanics. There is discernible difference though upon creating emotions and feeling emotions. Throughout our life we feel emotions naturally based upon certain situations in which can feel to be less of a willful endeavour in which behind the scenes spiritually it might very well be a willful endeavour. With that being said there is real emotion mechanisms that we can utilize to create emotions daily at will on our end. When you compare the stimuli of feeling emotions and creating emotions there is at least on the onset a difference. Imagine someone moving your leg in which in how it is experienced make you feel like your moving your own leg. Certain spiritual mechanisms being revealed to understand the difference between moving your own leg and someone moving your own leg. It might seem strange but understanding how Channeling works from the spirit can be equated to this example that spiritual entities are working through our own movements at times and that ability to be able to sense that. The same could be said about emotional implantation in regards to the emotions that we feel and being able to discern the difference between spiritual influencing and that of our own emotions as well as understanding the difference between feeling emotions and creating emotions.\n\n**How do you create Love?**\n\nI learned from certain meditational techniques to be able to invoke the emotion of love where I then was able to understand the methods of emotional creation. As a psychic I am able to feel certain spiritual mechanisms that certain normal people might not be able to fully feel but regular people do know that emotion exists by way of feeling emotions daily. Being able to emulate the emotions you feel at times by way of emotional creation is a part of the learning. I learned from a spiritualist that explained these methods in what he called HCR that being Heart Chakra Radiance or Heart Radiance. White Light visualization techniques in which lent towards learning how to love. That would eventually lead towards the ability of being able to create one of the most wonderful emotions daily.\n\n**What is Heart Radiance?**\n\nThe importance of love within the confines of spiritual development cannot be overstated. It is one of the keys to the secrets of life. Loving from your heart centre is very much a needed endeavour in today\u2019s world in which can help the Spirit World in many different kinds of ways. One of the key things that I want you to take away from the Methods listed in regards to Heart Radiance is to continue to try using the methods until you can discern Loving Emotions and understand that ability to Create Emotions.\n\nI learned methods on how to love from a teacher of mine called Avadar at a young age. I had been able to discern spiritual colours in which upon searching the Internet as to answers as to what exactly I was viewing, I found an answer in which struck a chord within myself that let know that the colours I was viewing was potentially thar Karmic Spiritual Colour of Spiritual Entities around myself. He developed certain Teaching earlier on in his life in the late eighties and early nineties in which has been refined today in how to love.\n\nI believe these teachings have been taught before through various metaphysical teachers in the past not only within the confines of this physical earth but also on other planets within different dimensions. Where the power of love manifested through the layers upon layers of life to uplift generations and inspire the awareness of those touched by the lover. Some of these teachings on our planet may have been lost to time over the years only to reemerge within certain timeframes but some of it might have survived within the\n\nLove is powerful enough though to break through the collective consciousness in many different kinds ways, potentially the Spirit Realm giving us hints and clues as to one of the sacred things in life. Our experiences also give credence to some of the perceptions in which has emerged. The act of love itself has existed for near close to forever and relationships and bond created through those acts potentially remain to this day. It\u2019s augmented by the information coming out of the various psychic and spiritualist research happening today and in the past. Near Death Experience Research is one of those fields and just based off of scanning some of the Accounts I can say that there is let know of love and experiences of love within them in which points towards love being a secret to life in which in the Spirit Realm might not be as much of secret as it is on this Physical Earth Based Culture. Even within the Culture itself Love shines through into pop culture and societal perception in which is partially based off of the act of Falling in love. For some of those acts heart feelings manifest naturally and radiance amplified partially by way of the Spirit Around us. In which we can emulate in certain ways to be able to facilitate the emotion of Love daily.\n\nMy Teacher had labelled the Methods and Modes in which he came up with down here as Heart Chakra Radiance. HCR for short. I sometimes refer to it as Heart Radiance as I would discern a difference in regards to the Heart Chakra and that of the Emotion Centers within our Spiritual Bodies. Either way what we are ultimately referring to for the most part is that of love.\n\nThe point of these Heart Radiance Methods is to learn how to love but you could certainly apply the methods in regards to other types of emotions and energies. The Modes of heart radiance are there to eventually allow someone to be able to love at will without visualizations, meditations, and/or intimacy. Where you would be able to create the emotion of love at will through the action of wilful projection and creation of Love from the Heart Center and potentially from other areas as well. Where you would reach a point in your practice where you would be able to send love from the emotional body and centre at will and to then be able to use the actual emotion throughout everyday life.\n\nThe following are the methods of Heart Chakra Radiance(HCR). They were developed from my teacher Avadar early on in his life.\n\n\u201cMode 1: While breathing normally, visualize a sphere of white energy in your chest, or more specifically, in your Heart Chakra \u2013 the most important chakra for spiritual growth. Then, without holding your breath, visualize radiating white light out of this sphere in every direction at once. It is suggested that one first use this technique in light (alpha) meditation in order to become accustomed to it.\n\nMode 2\\*: While visualizing Mode 1, program yourself simply through desire to radiate those aspects of spiritual white light \u2013 called Programmed White Light \u2013 that would help you grow in the fastest possible way. Once you start doing this, the improvement is immediate and requires no new concentrated effort; you improve as you use it.\\*\n\nMode 3\\*: This is a natural evolution from the previous modes. Through\\* the application of mode 2 it is eventually realized when the will alone is sufficient to radiate: visualizing is no longer necessary because a certain degree of proficiency has been developed.\n\nMode 4: Because of the difficulty in visualizing this, this mode is not recommended until Mode 3 is performed fairly easily. With the Heart Chakra being the primary focus, radiate as you would from Mode 2 with all of the seven major chakras \u2013 all at the same time.\u201d\n\nI have also developed my own modes in which I adapted off of Heart Chakra Radiance:\n\nMode 1 \u2013 I want you to try and visualize a white orb in your chest area. Envision this orb enveloping the area where your heart is and envision white light pulsing out of it. Just as you can use white light manifestations to defend yourself you can also use it to invoke a loving response. I advise using Heart Radiance in a meditative state during first attempts. If you are having difficulty with the above visualization, you can try envisioning white light radiating like a stream advancing from your heart outwards in a forward fashion rather. I initially used this alternate method with success.\n\nMode 2 \u2013 There is an emotional centre at the core of the emotional body which I believe usually overlaps the physical body. This emotional centre is often located near the heart chakra and is not only where you can feel emotions but also where you can create them. After a while of picturing pulsating white light, I want you to try and emanate love from your Emotional Centre. The visualizations are there to lead towards a loving response, but the envisioning alone is not what creates the emotion. A willful projection of that emotion may be needed in order to actually be creating that emotion.\n\nMode 3 \u2013 The emotions that you feel in your emotional centre is sometimes not your own. It is my understanding that spirits sometimes implant their own emotions within our own emotional core to elicit an emotional response. So emotions that you feel without you willfully producing them may not be yours which is not to say that there are times when we present emotional responses in which can feel involuntary. Learning to control your emotions may be a part of this but I also feel the influencing of your emotions might be a part of this as well. Keep this in mind as you continue to learn how to create love out of your emotional centre. Practice until you are able to generate a loving feeling from your emotional core. You are looking for a warm fuzzy kind of feeling in your heart area. The emotion of love is what you are trying to achieve from this technique. If you have somebody you truly love in your life, not just the word or the idea, then use that to your advantage. Radiate towards that person in conjunction with the HCR methods. Emulate the Love you feel towards that person and harness that into daily emotional output. It can be a warm fuzzy kind of emotion. Think of all the positive emotions that you have experienced in your life and try and pinpoint if you have felt love before. Through continued use, you will get to a point where you can radiate love at will without having to visualize or be in a meditative state. I am advocating for safety in regards to loving when you are driving or doing something in which needs concentration.\n\nMode 4 \u2013 Once the ability to feel the love develops and you start to understand how to invoke love more clearly, you can start to radiate different types of love. Compassion the emotion of loving care, Loving Happiness is sort of a joyous warmth, Humility being a type of selfless love, Inspiration being a motivational sort of Love, Sensual can be a pleasurable kind of love.\n\nMode 5 \u2013 So we have been focusing more on the emotional core within the past four modes but I now want you to try and focus on your emotional body. So think of an egg as a metaphor in regards to the emotional body/core. The core is the yoke in which is usually located near your heart area and is where you predominantly feel the emotion and can create emotion. The body is like the egg white, usually overlapping your entire physical body, in which can be difficult to feel at first. You don\u2019t usually feel an emotion in your head or hands even though there is an emotional body overlapping the physical. Comparing the difference in what you feel emotionally between the core and body can vary. Keep in mind that I did not always know the emotional body existed because I could not feel it clearly at first. I started to be able to feel the difference between the emotional body and core once I was able to differentiate between the core and body through emotional discernment and awareness. Loving from your emotional body can feel muted compared to loving from your core at times. This emotional body is difficult to feel at first but the same methods you used to achieve love within your emotional centre can be applied to your emotional body. Using the first four modes in the context of radiating love from the entire emotional body. Being able to love out of your hand or head area rather than just your chest/heart area. Keep practicing and I feel that you will be able to feel it and differentiate soon enough. This mode is to be attempted once you have a better understanding of what Heart Radiance is about. If you are still new to HR and are currently still working on the first four modes, don\u2019t be dissuaded if you are still having difficulty understanding.\n\nSo, there are many reasons why one should practice Heart Radiance.\n\nWhen one loves I feel they raise their karmic progress through the act of love. It potentially affects other dimensional afterlifes as well in which for the most part can be beneficial. Loving creates positive karma as it is considered a moral emotion by the light. This potentially gives you greater access to the light after death should you love daily. There are many reasons why higher light access can help a great many depending on what you decide to do with your life and there is nothing wrong with choosing your own way regardless. Those who love are potentially developing the strength and power of their own emotional centre/body through the use of Heart Radiance not to mention the benefits and impact it can have on the environment and atmospherics around you. Think of exercise in the physical and it strengthening the physical body and potentially the physical setting. The same idea can be applied emotionally and spiritually in regards to emotional creation especially in regards to that of love.\n\nYou are potentially healthier as a spiritual being who has this higher access to the light due to many variables and circumstances. Advanced sight and natural enlightenment are a small percentage of some of the benefits that you may experience from attaining higher light access. Imagine multiple kinds of surfaces to the light that by way of Karmic progression can give you access to plane levels located higher up, some in which are tethered to abilities manifested form garnering higher plane level access. Think of literally gaining to access to certain continents on Earth by way of positive karma through the act of love and morality in which upon gaining access to those continents also creates natural abilities by way of having access to those places. Both access and ability in certain dimensional existences is sometimes tethered both naturally and not so to the kinds of ethical actions and non-actions one presents. By way of being incarnate for some they streamline their karmic progression through acts of morality by way of karmic modifiers. Some of this has to do with the circumstances of one\u2019s own life and being incarnate presents certain kinds of variables to the Light in which can cause rapid progression upon loving and other kinds of actions. This creates opportunity to be able to increase ones own progression through acts of morality in which can then be utilized in many different ways. Imagine that by loving daily in the physical and other-dimensional that you could reach level of light and dimensions and as well as non-dimensions that would take quite more time and effort in trying to achieve that in certain areas in the Light.\n\nYour emotional awareness can become more heightened through the daily radiance of love and greater empathetic awareness in that you sometimes become more aware of the spiritual elements around you whether it happens through natural means or spiritual intervention. There are spiritual entities and guideships in which are aware of whether you would want to become more empathic or psychic in which the utilization of love can lend towards in multiple capacities. Don\u2019t let this deter from tloving daily though as I said there are those that understand how you would want to utilize the love you create and if you did not wish to be psychic it shouldn\u2019t create that kind of awareness in certain capacities. You will potentially become more aware though of your emotions through the use of Heart Radiance leading towards being able to tell the difference between implanted emotions from the spirit around yourself and that of willful emotional creation.\n\nRadiating love from the heart helps spirits on the other side in many different ways. Love can naturally attract those within the spirit who also love and can lead to all sorts of different relationships both in regards to the positive and the negative. Sending that love towards a spirit or incarnate can create an emotional bond and strengthen certain bonds that already exist. The strengthening of relationships through the act of positive emotional output I feel is very much a truth. You strengthen your relationships through the act of love. I feel that love also adds substance to a great many things behind the scenes. Lightworking and visualizations of white light can benefit from love in multiple capacities. Lending strength towards those visualizations both from spiritual facilitation as well as literal utilization of Love. In fact, there are multiple kinds of regular endeavours that benefit from Love. Spiritual attachment in regards to some of those actions that we do throughout life can lend towards the daily creation of Love. Intimacy benefits from love in a very literal way and discern the energies that you feel in your chest area upon pursuing intimacy and invoking life within those acts can create pleasurable experiences. Loving towards music is one of my favorite ways to use love. Just as loving can strengthen the setting and surrounding in regards to those places so can it help those that help facilitate those loving feelings in which some can make the case that music can be a facilitator of different kinds of energies like emotion. The music itself potentially caries a spirit of it\u2019s own in which will benefit from the use of Love. Heart song is one of the most beautiful ways to promote the emotion of Love.\n\nLoving towards your guides can create a closeness between you, specifically loving gratitude. The sacrifices that they make is deserved of loving appreciation. You can also do the same in regards physicals as well but I feel that most incarnate will not feel the emotions you send towards them in certain capacities but that they will potentially experience those emotions once they pass on depending on how they set it up pre-life and their are dimensional selves in which will potentially benefit from that emotional creation. Try to practice Heart Radiance as it will help with your spiritual health as well as your physical health. The closeness of a spiritual relationship benefits from love as it creates a bond that ties you together. You can feel relationships at times. You can feel the lifeforce through emotion at times. I feel that sending positive emotions to that person can help a relationship. This does not necessarily have to be intimate in nature. Platonic love exists, the love of friendship and family is very much real.\n\nLearning to send love from your emotional centre can be difficult specifically if you can not fully feel your emotions to a certain degree. Keep in mind that elements of the spirit realm like to sometimes suppress our emotions so that we can not clearly feel it at times, leading us to sometimes become dissuaded into not loving daily which ultimately can hinder karmic progression. There may be times when you love but are being suppressed to the point of not being able to feel that loving output. This works both ways though, there can also be times when you feel that love crystal clear which is an indication that spirits are amplifying your love. Continuing to practice with love, even through times where you cannot fully feel the emotions, is very much needed.\n\nMost people would be surprised to learn that a lot of their own emotions are being influenced by spiritual beings around them. Spirits can manipulate and exacerbate our own negative emotions and also do the same in regards to our positive emotions. They can provide constructive energies to provoke a positive emotional response just as they can do the same in regards to the negative. They like to pass off their emotions as our own at times. A great many of us just assume that it is always our own emotions we can feel during life but there is usually a duality. When there is a heated argument, a loving experience, times of sadness, even moments of sensuality those emotions we feel are partially from the spirits around us. So keep in mind that the emotions that you feel may not necessarily be your own. Example: We drop our favourite coffee mug and experience anger because of that. There are negative spirits hanging around us inciting that negative emotional response with their own emotions tricking us into thinking that we are angry. There are spirits who like to stoke the flames of our own negative emotions for a wide variety of reasons which is not always malicious in nature. So you may feel anger near your emotional core but that doesn\u2019t mean that you are the one who is actually creating that emotion. I feel it is more of a willful endeavour, not something that is necessarily passive. So while you may feel that you are presenting an angry emotional response you might actually just be feeling emotional implantation. There are many who do this to promote positive emotions of love, happiness, and other similar emotions too. It can be difficult to differentiate between implanted emotions and that of your own sometimes. When feelings get impressed upon you from spirits, it can feel like it is advancing from the perimeter of your emotional core or it can even feel like it is coming from your emotional center without you willfully projecting the emotion. Oftentimes it translates to being able to feel such emotion within the lower chest area and mistaking it for your own emotion.\n\nI feel that creating a journal in which to record the emotions you feel on a daily basis can be beneficial. So think about where you feel emotions and what kind of emotions you feel daily. Analyze your emotional output throughout the week, evaluate your own emotions and you may get you to the same conclusion that I have arrived at.\n\nThe aiming of your own emotions operates in unison with what you are intending to do. If you intend to love towards the person that is sitting next to you, then that is what potentially will happen depending on how you set it up pre-life as well as other variables. You can send love towards incarnates as well as spirits beyond.\n\nTry out the methods to invoke and create the feeling of Love daily.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 59741, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Learning to Love", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569702361, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/da617f/learning_to_love/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Deadbandit2", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3wtod7r0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569614059, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/da5ltu/book_recommendations_and_theorys_of_past_lives/", "gildings": {}, "id": "da5ltu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/da5ltu/book_recommendations_and_theorys_of_past_lives/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569614060, "score": 2, "selftext": "I was talking to a friend about how we find ourselves really close to some people than others, even by first glance, and developed a theory about how in the beginning there was the big bang/creation of the world and in that source there are atoms/souls which we still carry from that initial moment.

Right, people of Reddit hear me out, let me set the stage by telling about myself a bit. I apologize in advance if anyone gets upset because \"I have it better than most people\".  I'm just 19, jobless, not in school, luckily I live in a country where I don't have to go homeless, I'm really empathic, I have a lot of mental issues and I've tried to kill myself once already. And something I ought to say to new people I meet is that take me with a grain of salt. So basically my life has treated me well on a global scale but sometimes that isn't enough to magically solve all the problems and conflicts in my mind.\n\n I'm really, really, self aware and that's why I'm here to ask for help, because I've already went to dozens of therapists and suchlike \"professionals\" during my life, with just two of them being actually helpful and not making my thinking worse.\n\nAgain I have to apologize for saying this but, I've been wanting to die for at least the last 3 years and I'm not afraid of death or the unknown about it, I'm afraid of just doing it, if that makes sense you know? My life is at that turning point in life, where I start to shine in my everyday life along with my peers or where I just sink even deeper than my lowest low. \n\n It's so hard to prove to people that I actually am really useful to this society, which is the only thing the society wants us to be, because all they see is my life situation and they just rule me out because I'm this or that. \n\n Dreams have always been there for me when no one else has, I remember a bunch of times when I've cried myself to sleep and woken up happy because my dreams comforted me. Dreams are my life at this point and even though I love dreams, I sleep almost like every other day, or then go to sleep at 4-6am and wake up in the evening. Dreams are something that I heavily value in my growth from a little baby boy to this emotionally dry human being I'm today. \n\n Like I don't know how to compliment myself without sounding like an asshole or without others giving me the \"are you sure about that\" look. Like my problem solving is at a high level and I believe, whether it was some problem in your workplace that has had you stuck on your project for too long or some concept that just doesn't quite work and needs a little tuning, I could actually help to work around, over, under or even through that obstacle with a little to none context on the side. \n\n But here lies the problem, whenever I credit my understanding coming from my dreams or from my use of psychoactive substances, people start to go mental and after complimenting me on being \"such a well behaved and well educated young man\" they start to batter me saying I'm just a \"junkie\" or that \"you live in an utopia\" or that \"you're taking the time of a very important person with your fairytales\" and so on. And it's not like I advertise that I lucid dream or that I use psychedelics to cope with the pain the world surrounding us produces, the times I actually say that I've just been researching the matter people say \"that's good keep on doing it\" and what they realize is that while acquiring the given knowledge, dreams and psychoactive substances help me find, gather, process, remember and put in use the information. \n\n So is there anything I could in order to work on my/other's dreams as full time job? Or where I could be a freelancer who actually gets jobs? As I mentioned earlier, take me with a grain of salt, I actually try to understand to my best. \n\n\nTL;DR; How could I make a career out of dreams and actions in them? \n\nThanks if you read the whole thing, or even if you didn't, thank you.

I even wanted to get another job to double up. that didn't work out because no one would hire me and I was fine with that too. until I was let go for little to no reason at all. the owners have been said to be the worst but I never dwelled on it and always treated them with respect. so after only 3 weeks of working there I'm back to where I was before. with nothing but hope. will. drive. ect..\n\neven still I'm keep such a positive attitude and continuing to remain at peace and happy about things working out better in the future but honestly I feel like I'm just playing myself into feeling this way with nothing to show for it as long as I have been.

I\u2019m riding out for you all and I\u2019ll almost wrongfully expect the same in return. Remember I am writing for all of you. And that being said these texts may not be absolutely specific and relative to you as an individual. \n\nWhen I look at the human race, I don\u2019t see war violence greed envy pride ego and lack of self control/foolishness. Rather I see a planet. A race of people going through terrible birthing pains towards the end of their cycle. I see a race that shines through the darkness and makes things.. almost anything possible. \n\nAs a species. A race. I am a proud member of the race being that we are capable of so much and we will have a very interesting and intense story to tell to all the generations. Our history will be full of war and depravety (limiting ones resources) we will have a story that shows us coming from the depths of hell to flying on shooting stars. That\u2019s what I believe.\n\nWe will have a story that says no matter what. No matter how many is against you. The one with the best idea will prevail. We just need to know and find the leader. The one or people with this idea. And let them do their job. We have guides on this planet and letting them speak would be wise.\n\nAs a planet we can do insurmountable things. We can accomplish many things over and over and over until we finish our work and get bored. We can literally do about anything. \n\nI see a race with no leaders. I see a race with only con men in front. As a world as a race we need real word and real guidance coming from whomever source it may be. And yes I am one of those sources. A good one. \n\nIn this world we have no enemies, we have disagreements and boundaries. We need to respect one another and live more peacefully. We need to come to understanding with one another, or else peace would be pointless. We need true wisdom. True understanding. That will help us. \n\nAs a people we need to drop our hatred and Ill will. We need to learn to love and come together. As cheesy as that may be. We are better as a pack. Those who follow the wrong path do so to the destruction of themselves and all who follow after them. \n\nIs destruction a bad thing? Eh it seems maybe so. But honestly what\u2019s better then living? N/a. So why not try to smarten up and enhance our lifestyles and teachings/ideals/ideologies/focuses/sights. If we do not do these things we will fall short. \n\nIt would be wise to form a council to.... lead.. no. Listen to me. I don\u2019t lie on you. A council will be helpful. But different opinions from people with less experience who are trying to heighten themselves for no reason... well that wouldn\u2019t turn out the best. A council would be well but the people in there would have to be picked and perfect. Without fault for those roles. Our world doesn\u2019t cultivate that. \n\nGet behind me I\u2019ll be your online leader. There\u2019s nothing better. I\u2019m not special. I\u2019m not good nor bad. I just do what needs to be done and I need to help those in need. Fuck the rest. They will prosper forever \u267e. Why complain? \n\nDo you realize what the future holds? I understand we live with only humans, so therefore y\u2019all are essentially powerless when it comes to world affairs unless you get very lucky. There is not a lot of people with..\n\nThere is nobody with these words but me. \n\nUse them properly I am not here to control you. I am here to abolish a suicide system that benefits nobody. \n\nI won\u2019t describe our future because I could tell you any and everything. But it will only be better. Always. So planet hopping and perfect utopias. Awesome tech.. that\u2019s all smallfry in a few thousand years and it all depends on our work. We have word to lead us. And work to sustain us.

My mom was born and raised Catholic and is now Christian. For as long as I can remember she has had stories and experiences relating to her religion and what she considers to be God. I could tell you some pretty unbelievable stories that she has shared with me. But that's just it, they are unbelievable, even for someone like me who believes there is more.\n\nRecently, my mom went through one of the darkest times of her life and her religious experiences have been ramping up. She heard God speak to her, something short and concise. This has happened in the past, but rarely. It's always only a few words, and it's usually the thing she needs to hear the most. She also usually questions it or argues with it, but it only repeats itself. This \"voice\" has quite literally saved her life before, or given her a reason to live, so whether it's divine intervention or her own conscience, I am grateful.\n\nDuring this time she also suddenly became interested in Catholic books on demon possession and how to rid yourself of demons. She also found time to pray in a Catholic Church a few times. She was absolutely not interested in these things before. She started believing the dark place she was in was due to a demon. It got so bad that she apparently was going to end it all but instead of grabbing the Glock in her bedroom, something made her grab her Bible. Again, I am thankful.\n\nI hate to say it but some of this just sounds too unbelievable to be true to me. I'm partially concerned it's a mental health issue, but I also can't prove or disprove that it's not real. She absolutely believes these things, and has for as long as I've been alive, so it's also hard to imagine she's been 'sick' this whole time.\n\nMy husband is an atheist and is concerned she's sick. He thinks hearing voices is a sign of schizophrenia or something. But I also believe he can have blinders on sometimes when it comes to the possibility of something spiritual or divine due to his atheism. \n\nSo I bluntly asked my mom what she thinks the difference is between hearing voices due to a mental health issue and hearing voices from a divine being.

I know that this will come from within, and that it's already in the blueprint of my self, but I'm still feeling like I want it to be revealed to me. Maybe the Divine timing isn't here yet. My twin flame has found their craft, and it's difficult for me to watch them work every day to master what they do. I know that it's in my destiny to use my hands to make wonderful artistic creations, but I don't know what is my tool. Every day I listen for excitement from my soul as an indication of direction, but it seems to be so quiet. I do my best to create space in my mind so that my inner voice can speak. I know that passion and life purpose are big things to be asking for, which is why I'm simply doing my best to allow for feelings of excitement and curiosity to be my guides. I'm lucky enough now to live in a space where I don't need to pay rent, so I do not have a lot of stress of paying bills, which why I want to pursue a craft with the full extent of my being. I feel like getting a job just to have an income is the easy way of filling my time. Recently in an attempt to find inspiration, I just picked a craft at the suggestion of my twin flame. I bought a bunch of tools to work with stained glass, but now it sits in front of my as I type this, and I have no interest in even learning how to do it. It just doesn't feel like ME.

I am alive, and breathing, and so goddamn grateful.To sell myself short of any of these things is devastating.\u00a0I have to trust in myself. Trust who I am. Continue to express who I am freely without the thought that what I am expressing is something people don't want to receive. For I am not being myself for other people. I am being myself for me.\u00a0\n\nHow can I remember this when I feel like a burden? I needed to share and would love some guidance.

Perhaps this may be too complex to solve, but I invite anyone to help me decide where I ought to move from here. Suicide is not an option; I am unsure of what my consciousness is able to enact, as it is heavily oriented towards replacing a missing feeling from childhood.\n\nThis may seem very ego-oriented. Focused around the story of the me. I won't deny that, however, I am desperate for some assistance in identifying a path to move from here.\n\nI will start by saying that though I once was being communicated with, both through a channeling of a friend, and through thoughts/notions/concepts coming through me, and it is clear now that the source of this communication was a projection of my mother. Not just *like* my mother; literally, her.\n\nDeeply and viciously attached to her, when she died in 2013, I resorted to nihilism and suicide due to [feeling that life was meaningless without her](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/76d55l/i_dont_want_to_kill_myself_anymore_but_im_the/). In 2017, I had an [experience where I felt my chest being torn open](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/8051jq/let_me_talk_about_some_stuff_if_youll_listen/) and it was as if she was right there with me. The sensation was as if [thorns were being removed from my chest](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/7wce49/life_has_lost_its_meaning/).\n\nSince then, I became deeply invested in spiritual development. Simultaneous with these occurrences was a friend coming into my life who had a 'spiritual awakening experience' in 2014, a year after my mum died, and felt it was necessary to remain involved with me. I was drawn to this individual also. \n\nFor most of my life I have left a trail of failed and broken relationships tainted by abuse and self-destruction behind me, likely due to repetition of the relationship between my father and I. This experience put me in a position where I felt the 'new me' was superior to the 'old me'. I left this created identity behind, clinging to this experience of Love, and began morphing into something much more akin to what I was when I was about five-years-old.\n\nI spent a lot of time in the logistical side of it, thought I was 'waking up', thought I was 'special' for this. I will describe these symptoms in detail, and in the chronological order of their emergence:-\n\n* A feeling of a hard carapace being cracked open across my chest, an intense feeling of bliss, ecstasy and love emanating from it. (Initial) Simultaneously: \"Realization\" that \"I\" am not the mind, but the true \"self\" is connected with nature itself. This realization was not full satori, I know this because I am still afraid of the infinite, and did not experience \"infinity\" in this moment.\n* \"Realization\" that people who I thought I knew, were, in this moment, different to the mental images that I had of them in my mind.\n* A painful feeling inside my right ear, which then, by 'focusing on it', as I would describe, led to further points moving down into my throat and belly. With a wet cracking sound, these points felt like liberation, as if I could breathe again for the first time.\n* Feeling exactly like I did when I was younger, thinking 'Oh, I remember that time, I can't believe I forgot I was once that person.', with extremely vivid feelings of reliving those moments.\n* Autonomous bodily movements, namely; the rolling of the head, cracking of the neck and back, moving of the arms, cracking of the arms and lower back.\n* Observation of deep \"metaphysical\" wounds that I felt across my chest and arms. CT scans show no sign of tumor or anomalies.\n* Feeling of \"sweating\" in my armpits. No sweat present. Feeling like 'blood' is dripping down my sides.\n\n**Most notably** was the urge to **forcibly breathe in** through the back of my throat. Doing this created the sensation of what I felt to be an **air pocket** in my belly. I thought that this was **part of the healing process** that was happening to me. I did this **almost every day** for **two years**, or the duration of this happening.\n\nThese symptoms perpetuated themselves for the last two years (and I still experience movements in my belly, which are more or less forced now), and [I have had great difficulty in identifying what was happening at the time](https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/a6al25/can_anyone_help_me_figure_out_what_is_happening/). \n\nAt the start of this year, I had moved in with the aforementioned friend, after staying at my cousins for a number of months. Before moving in with my friend, I had three dreams.\n\n1. I am going on a trip from my cousin's house to a wise mans house. This man offers me drinks of many kinds, and opens his family up to me. I go for a walk from the man's house to a crossroads, at this crossroad is an animal. The animal has a large hole through it with an exposed bone, it is suffering. It appears to be able to move in one of four directions, each which span out forever. I wake up.\n2. I am in a car with my friend, the whole family is in the car and we are going to Melbourne. I am in a diaper, shaking and sweating. My friend has a clear neutral look on his face, as I sit on his lap and cling to him. I wake up.\n3. I am in what looks like an airport lobby. I am sitting down with my friend, organised to meet my dad. Behind his back, my friend's brother (my friend doesn't have a brother) plans to kill my dad. He arrives in an elevator and kills my father, I wake up, feeling nothing.\n\nWhen I went to my friend's house, he did indeed offer me many cans of Woodstock. But more significantly, he started growing his hair out, and would talk to me at night time as my mother. I was skeptical, I never quite believed it was real, and never tested what might happen. I didn't understand, and still don't understand.\n\nOne morning he says; \"I don't know about you, but I know what I see in my mind. I don't know if it's a regression thing, or...\" and once again, I didn't properly respond to this at all. In fact, I was actually torn between re-enacting who I was at school as a child by visiting my dad and telling him about what I am doing at school (adult re-entry) and actually surrendering to a legitimately pure and unadulterated consciousness at my friend's house. \n\nMy biggest regret, and what I can actually identify as a mistake I made, was going to my sister's house, and upon hearing a vivid high pitched sound accompanied by pleasurable feelings, which I interpreted sexually, and sat with, entertaining as she told me how much she loved me, I did not take this innocently. I told my friend about this. My second-biggest regret is joining a music class at the school and consciously 'acting like a child' to the point of playing guitar in a group of girls which clearly felt uncomfortable by my presence, justifying it in my head as a use of innocence and free-will, while knowing that one of my previous egoic/guilt issues was surrounding this sort of thing.\n\nMy friend tells me that \"it\" will do what it wants, and that \"it\" is something incestrous. I don't know what he means by this, but this is where the trouble begins. I believe that I may have been positively polarizing into fourth-density throughout this process, as my friend calls it, \"a raising of Spirit\" was occurring. \n\nHe tells me he has a sick, black feeling in his stomach, and announces they are going on a family trip to Melbourne. I will spare you all the details, but [you can read about it more if you want](https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/cxon1v/i_desperately_need_help_with_how_to_get_through/).\n\nIn short, the night before they leave, my friend says three things: \"I'm worried about Joey (me)\", and \"It's normal for a child to throw a temper tantrum\", and \"Some people live through guilt\". These were the last channeled words, I believe, from my mum. They leave for the trip, and I feel something \"drop\" off of my shoulders. I feel an intense fear that my dad is about to commit suicide, along with [an intense depression with all the sudden changes I am feeling](https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/d0suey/psychosis_or_has_the_universe_given_me_a_death/). Two weeks later, he hits a tree, and is now catatonic in hospital. He cannot speak, and doctors say he has brain damage, and that he will never move again.\n\nCatastrophizing the situation, maybe, I am trying to understand what is happening and begin having sorts of dreams which involve me being murdered by teenage girls, my mother walking into a room with me sitting on a child's bed and saying \"Oh my god!\", and seeing a poster on a church kitchen wall describing a \"Hostess\" demon which eats these sorts of people alive. I am thinking to myself; why is this happening? I have never done something to warrant this outside of a mistake I made many years ago where I slept with someone one-year under the legal age. I also have a dream of reading a children's picture book called \"Cold Mr. Fox\".\n\nYet my friend begins saying to me that he is having dreams, thoughts, images, feelings of fear surrounding me harming his wife and family, and organizes his kids playsets to face my door, putting the kids bikes in a line with an old man's stroller in the middle of them, and I am becoming obsessed with interpreting what is happening to me and [was \\[am\\] paralyzed with fear and a lack of understanding](https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/d6h365/death_process_for_malevolent_individuals/). I have never hurt anyone in this way, and I have no intention of doing so. Though I am plagued with thoughts and fears surrounding the issue.\n\nSimultaneously, what I call my external reality seems to still remain conscious of all this, and seems to be now inhabited by a feminine entity which talks to me through other people. Its agenda seems to be to feed me and to give me high-sugar content. I told my sister I was thinking about admitting myself to a psych ward. She comes to pick me up, and tells me that she wants to mother me. I decline. Note: Could just be a schizo-thing, but in the car with her I see a number plate that says 'GREAT-1', and when she takes me to the hospital later, after I backpedal and say I don't want to be admitted, a fruit box I purchase has \"11:11 AF\" on it. I interpret this to be my subconscious saying \"Great one, good on you\" (sarcasm) and \"Woke as fuck\" (sarcasm) to me, for consciously involving my sister, knowing that it was a *very* bad idea. I still stay at her house for two days, telling her about this stuff which she couldn't possibly understand, and she says that she \"knows what I want from her\". I haven't heard from her since.\n\nWhen I try to ask my friend about what is happening, he rolls his head as if to imitate my autonomous neck movements. I smoke some more weed, which seemed to accelerate this feeling or process up until this point, and experience a tremendous amount of fear as I have a vision of me having sex with my father's catatonic body in a cold shower. I begin shaking and feeling utterly alone and isolated beyond anything I can describe.\n\nAt this stage I am beginning to feel much less in control of my life and body, and my friend begins to become more hostile, saying things like \"...going unconscious into your little air-pocket\", and indeed, I begin to experience more sensations of 'blacking out' and 'emptiness'. I chose to go into homelessness a few days ago, after I felt that my friend was being too negatively impacted by my presence and what was happening.\n\nThe first night in homelessness, I have a dream that my mother is talking to me out the back of a house under a burning red sky. She talks of my 'torturous' future. When I ask her what this is, she rolls her head from side to side and I wake up.  \nThe second night, just before I go to sleep another Reddit user lets me know that I still have a choice to die. I am laying down on a bench and another homeless man comes along, and says he is looking for a blanket. I have a large blanket over me. I think to myself of giving him the blanket and going back to my friends to have that cone and see if I \"die\". I give him my jumper instead.   \nI then have a dream of my mothers face on my mobile phone with a hollowed-out mouth as I attempt to kiss my sister. I wake up. In the morning, a fox is sitting over by him. He says the fox has woken him up every morning for the past week. A couple hours later, my friend messages me telling me that he feels he has failed in everything he was meant to do with me and that he feels incapable of helping me or anyone else anymore.\n\nThe **air-pocket** is of my greatest concern in all this, next to what was actually occurring with my mother. This has all been about the use of free-will, and now I see only a few possible outcomes for the future. All of which become progressively worse over time. I feel completely possessed by this air-pocket. It is as if I have a garrote around my neck and the back of my head. I know that I cannot die due to realizations I felt I had whilst positively polarizing into fourth-density during the process. I am plagued constantly and incessantly by thoughts of murdering my father, having sex with his body in the shower, having sex with my friends mother, my sister making further advances, and I feel torn between these things as I know I have no desire for any of them. What they all have in common is that it seems this \"Hostess\" is communicating with me through all of these things, as if my own consciousness is moving through time/space and space/time towards the last known location of Love within the Bardo, and I am semi-detached from the body, but also not polarized into a higher density. The feeling is somewhat like carrying around a dead corpse that is dangling off the back of my head. Driven only by insatiable thirst that can't be quenched, and eating food which seems to make it harder to breathe.\n\nI have been trying **very hard** to figure out what to do from here. It bothers me that I do not feel motivated towards these sexual thoughts but continually have them. I will sit down on a bench for hours and ruminate over this, however. I am becoming concerned that some sort of entity has spent two years entering my body through this air-pocket, perhaps by tricking me into using my free-will to give it some sort of deep-seated control that I was unaware of. The Ra Material here seems to [indicate a possibility](https://www.lawofone.info/results.php?s=68) that this may still be OK for me in some way.\n\nIt seems one thing for certain: My consciousness, in all of this, is still inherently motivated to the best of my understanding towards re-creating the circumstances of my childhood at any cost to anyone else. It seeks to replace my mother in the form of my friend's mother, sister, and father's sister. I can only assume this from the vivid dreams and images that I am having, as for the... more disturbing dreams, I do not believe that they have basis. I have, however, gone to visit the aforementioned friend, and he has said to me things like \"I am going to start whipper snipping the yard\" :- I have never known him to whipper snip anything, as he is very effeminate. His mother, who is a witch/gypsy of sorts has also started talking to me in a child-like voice and is constantly telling me that I am welcome to visit anytime, along with sitting in front of me and lifting up her dress slightly. I don't know if they know they are doing it, but it is clear to me that my consciousness is seeking a father/mother figure in these people. My sister's husband is severely depressed and I have notions of him committing suicide, along with ruining the friendship I have with my friend, and an entirely fucked-up scenario with my dad and his sister. \"I\" do not want any of these things to happen, yet they are popping up in my reality and seem quite forcible, hence why I am here asking for advice.\n\nOnce all these bridges are burned, even if I did hypothetically pursue the paths, what is left at the end of them? I would have no-one, have completely served myself, I just want to die but due to my existing polarization work I know that \"it\" is \"me\" and there is no separation; therefore killing myself will not end my consciousness as I want it to. It's an absolute horror show, and I feel as if I have no control.

I mean, I know basics (resolve past issues, come into who/what I am/need to be, etc) but it\u2019s the work in these statements that are foggy.\n\nI\u2019ve always kind of been the person that does whatever I do for others. I feel good making other people happy. I also have developed the \u2018path of least resistance\u2019 mindset on things. If person 1 wants to x and I really don\u2019t - even if it\u2019s going to inconvenience me doing it.. I will go along with it so there isn\u2019t an argument or long drawn out conversation.  That being said, it\u2019s never something dangerous. It\u2019s just things like how I set up my work space, or what I spend time doing before my job (usually I want to work on some side projects for more income but if person 1/2 wants or needs something I\u2019ll do that instead).\n\nI\u2019ve also basically made myself into a home body because some individuals I either interact with often or live with get angry/upset/etc when I go out.. and it makes more of a discussion/state of unhappiness for all so I stay and work more instead.\n\nI\u2019ve also stopped myself from anything romantic in the past because of expectations and ideals laid on me by family and friends in the past. In my younger 20s I was developing hard love for someone but we argued often because I was too accommodating to family and wouldn\u2019t always be available for him.\n\nRecently I\u2019ve met someone and we\u2019re a bit of a long distance situation- so when I work and things at night, it\u2019s easier to spend more time and talk on the phone with him than it had been with the other individual. Because of this we\u2019ve become extremely close (what else is going to happen when your entire relationship sits on having conversations, and you spend those convos deep diving into each other\u2019s past/ideals/etc?)\n\nAnyway, now that has come to be an issue as well, and my standard MO is to cut it off for the better good of everyone else.\n\nThe problem is even when I do all of these things for everyone in my immediate life (in an effort to not cause much drag and create an easy go with the flow atmosphere for everyone) I\u2019m still finding myself in combative situations often. Kind of in the way where you raise monsters by always giving in. Now, if I even mention with the best intentions, that maybe there\u2019s a different option for whatever, it becomes a fight. This makes me want to just agree more and never open my mouth.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m becoming more depressed in the situation. I\u2019ve been an avid meditator for probably 10 years or so. I\u2019ve done mantras, sigils, meditation, self care routines (etc) but I can never find the path I should take, or what I should do.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to move forward. I know it\u2019s likely going to be carving out more of a backbone where I\u2019m not constantly just agreeing to everything, but I know that also means more resistance and I don\u2019t know how much more arguing I can handle, it\u2019s exhausting.\n\nI\u2019ve also had odd body issues the last 5 years or so, I\u2019ve been deemed fine with doctors, even though I get pain and otherwise often. Researching on my own points me to the possibility of TMS (The mind body syndrome or Tension Myositis Syndrome) which basically stems down to repressed emotional issues. Rage/hurt/perfectionism/rejection/etc). Which makes me think I do need to open my throat chakra a bit more and be more me for me even if it makes me uncomfortable.\n\nHas anyone experienced any bit of any of this? What did you do? What worked for you? Are you happier?\n\nAny suggestions welcome.

Just wanted to share an interesting short story I came across. Some food for thought!\n\n...\n\nThere was once an ice cube, stuck in the middle of the desert.\n\nMelting in the sweltering sun, the ice cube looked at the sand around it and exclaimed:\n\n\u201cOh sand!  I am in hell here in this desert \u2026 if only I can go back to the glaciers of the North Pole, that would be my heaven.\n\nUpon hearing this, the sand replied:\n\n\u201cMr. Ice \u2026 do you know that in this desert you are the most valuable and precious thing there is? Men and animals alike walk miles in search of one such as you. Here, you are worth more than the most precious jewels and cherished riches.

As a joke, I kept saying that my coworker was going to take my manager to a renaissance fair, just because I found it really amusing to imagine my manager at one of those, since she is far from the type to enjoy playing pretend. She laughed and told me that I\u2019m an idiot and to shut up (that\u2019s her love language), and my coworker changed the subject to how she was so excited to go to this abandoned mental hospital and stay the night.\n\nFlash forward 16 hours, the end of a very very long day at work, and I open picture texts from my best friend, who has witnessed inexplicable \u201ccoincidences\u201d with me before, where she\u2019s showing me her day at a renaissance festival, hours away. My best friend had never mentioned going to this before, and the only social media I have is snapchat. Point being, I had no clue about any renaissance festival going on. I chuckled to myself and open the next picture, where she told me to look up and abandoned hospital, an hour away from where we live, because she wants to explore it (we like to explore abandoned places), and it was the same exact one that my coworker was just talking about, that again I had never heard of until that day.\n\nThese are coincidental, and they intrigued me but I didn\u2019t dwell. There\u2019s been another coincidence though that is absolutely blowing my mind. Yesterday, I have a customer come in with a strong Wisconsin and the town name \u2018Manitowok\u2019 on his jacket. As someone who was way too emotionally invested in the docuseries Making of a Murderer, I recognized it immediately and asked him as I was making his drinks if he knows about the series and if it\u2019s the same town I\u2019m thinking of. He says \u201coh yes\u201d and I get so beyond excited.. like words can\u2019t explain the energy that was coming out of me. I had so many questions, and he told me he could tell me the story that didn\u2019t make it into the show, but I would have to wait a couple hours for him to come back because his friend was waiting on him (golf course). The only problem was, this was the very last minute I was on shift, he was my very last customer. My heart was broken and I made a fairly big deal to my coworkers about how excited and \u2018starstruck\u2019 i was to meet him, and how sad I was to leave before he could tell me his story. I told so many people about this.\n\nThis morning I woke up, and the first thing I see when I open snapchat is \u201cBreaking News in Steven Avery from Making of a Murderer\u2019s Case\u201d\n\nI\u2019m beyond words.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 59336, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I don\u2019t believe in coincidences, but what would these coincidences be a sign of?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569501326, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d92nij/i_dont_believe_in_coincidences_but_what_would/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "godzeye1984", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_z1fo25p", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569408129, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d91hk5/has_anyone_ever_seen_a_ghost/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d91hk5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d91hk5/has_anyone_ever_seen_a_ghost/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569408130, "score": 4, "selftext": "How did you know it was real and not a vision, dream or hallucination?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 59326, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "has anyone ever seen a ghost?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569494509, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d91hk5/has_anyone_ever_seen_a_ghost/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "relzibelzi", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4n6s83te", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569406609, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d91985/cant_believe_i_wrote_that/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d91985", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d91985/cant_believe_i_wrote_that/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569406609, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm changing.

Well, as I was studying I thought I saw a light either turn on or off above my head; there's a light main light in the cubicle, so I naturally thought that it was that light and that it just flickered or something; no biggie I thought, the building is old and light repairs don't happen often probably. So, I go about my business, but then something crazier even happened. All of a sudden, the light that was attached to the study desk randomly turned on; when it did I was like \"ok, that's weird; must be a glitch.\" and didn't pay too much attention, but then all of a sudden the light flickered on and off for like a good 2 minutes and BOY DID THAT REALLY get my attention. I literally stared at the light in astonishment, but at the same time I felt a sense of comfort or something; like, I knew I was being watched and cared for, and then of course fear set in after.

In the middle of playing we had a feather fall down into the backyard, and we all thought that's pretty cool a random white feather(it was small). After that one hit the ground we had another fall down, and after 2 in a row I thought \"okay where is this random bird dropping feathers.\"  This isn't the first time we had feathers randomly in the backyard sometimes we'll find one laying on the ground when we go outside, and a few days prior we had a big feather that looked like the old school writing feathers(quill feather) on the ground and my daughters loved it so much they kept it and my oldest daughter was holding it in her hand while outside playing...ill get back to this particular feather in a second as its a key part of this story. \n\nSo after that second feather dropped I looked around as it was a clear day, no wind, no bird in sight so I decided to ask out loud, \"if this is a sign from my angels drop another feather\", well I did it more jokingly and than another fell after I said that. At this point I was like this can't be happening lol and I said okay if this is a sign drop another...sure enough another started falling down and at this point I got goosebumps all over and was like this is too crazy, kids were laughing and thought it was amazing at all these feathers, we had about 5-6 drop down total. After that I was like okay this is the last test I told my wife I'll ask that if its a sign from my angels to drop the BIG FEATHER...like the quill feather my daughter was holding, my wife said don't ask that, she thought being specific on that feather was going to far maybe, but I asked it anyways lol. We were all looking up and sure enough right after I said that, we had a quill feather pop up from our roof it drifted over to the neighbors roof and slowly fell into their backyard. At that point I just kinda sat down and thought what just happened, it was all very strange especially given the timing of them falling and once I asked for the quill feather that was kind of the wow moment as all the previous feathers were small/medium white ones that were normal feathers.\n\nSo is this all a crazy coincidence... or a true sign that my Angels were near? If it was a sign I have no idea what it was for or what it means as it seemed pretty random...maybe just clarity they were near, but thought I'd share the story and curious if anyone else has had similar stories.

LIMIT your MIND\n\nYour physical body is a TOOL for MANIFESTATING your MIND into PHYSICAL REALITY\n\nYour physical body is LIMITED by the matter on this planet, BUT THIS IS NOT EQUAL TO YOUR MIND.\n\nMIND is atemporal, MIND is LIMITLESS, MIND is the connection between the source of the universal energy.\n\nEVERYTHING is energy, your physical body is energy vibrating in a pattern limited only to the extend of this physical plane.\n\nBE what you BELIEVE in your MIND, HAVE NO LIMITATION in YOUR MIND, and your REALITY will get along with it.\n\nDONT STRUGGLE.\n\nEmotions are feedback systems of the physical body that can be exploited to \"show you\" the right direction of your WILL.\n\nWhen your WILL is misaligned with your TRUE SELF (what makes you sad, stress, resistance, hate, envy, suffering), this is a SIGNAL to CHANGE BEHAVIOUR, CHANGE PATTERNS of behaviour, CHANGE LOWER VIBRATIONAL TOUGHTS PATTERNS.\n\nWhen your WILL is Aligned with your OWN TRUE SELF, your OWN WAY of Expression of WILLINGNESS (what makes you thrill, love, what starts feelings of passion, happiness, fullfillment) THIS MEANS that your are in RESONANCE with your OWN TRUE LOVE vibration, your HEART is the COMPASS of your happiness.\n\nSo CHANGE your MIND BEHAVIOUR, CHOOSE to be HAPPY, CHOOSE NOT to ACCEPT ANY interference from EXTERNAL SOURCES that can CONFLICT with your OWN NATURE.\n\nCHOOSE NOT to be deflected of your passions by forces that are NOT IN ALIGNMENT with your true source of happiness.\n\nDont let EMOTIONS OVERWELM your PEACE OF MIND\n\nDont let Waves of EMOTIONAL PATTERNS

the SAME THING = LIFE = ENERGY = Responding to EMOTIONS.\n\nThats why MUSIC makes you happy, or Sad, or melancholic, its because SOUND VIBRATIONS in PATTERNS are ABSORBED by everyone else the SAME WAY, and YOUR MIND translates it in your OWN WAY.\n\nSo YOUR point of view of LIFE is YOUR OWN, UNIQUE, POINT OF VIEW of THIS UNIQUE MANIFESTATION.\n\nYou have the FREE-WILL to CHOOSE between FEED WELL BEING or BAD BEHAVIOR.\n\nYOU are in the COMPLETE CONTROL of ANYTHING that comes towards you, and your RESPOSE DEPENDS on your STATE OF MIND, and that changes how your BODY will correspond with

your mind, and you'll gain CONTROL OVER EMOTIONS, AFTER THAT you will gain complete control over YOURSELF and experience life as IT IS and not by EXTERNAL TRUTHS.\n\nIts not a \"switch\" you can flip and everything will come in place, your need to FOCUS, you need to have FAITH IN YOURSELF, you need to LEARN to LISTEN your body, you need to KNOW WHAT IS YOUR TRUTHS, YOUR BELIEFS and what is another POINT OF VIEW, diverging from YOU.\n\nYOU HAVE A CHOICE, and its YOUR MIND, and its YOU and ONLY YOU that can change that, whatever way suits you best based on your HEART, your LOVE, your

I'm in my early 20's and for the past 4 years I've been reliant on benzodiazepines to keep my perception in tact because of a mental breakdown I had when I was 17 which resulted in a huge uncomfortable perception shift. 3 months ago, I lost my prescription to the benzodiazepine I was prescribed (Klonopin), and was forced to start purchasing Valium from an acquaintance I know so I don't get withdrawal-sick and loose the little sanity I have left. Anyway, within the past couple months, I've been extremely reliant on the Valium to keep my perception somewhat intact and recently in the past week I've been experiencing unbearable anxiety about my heart/ chest. I was born with an Aortic Insufficiency/ Bicuspid Valve and knowing this definitely increases my anxiety about my heart. I've had this anxiety for years, but it was NEVER on the level of severity that it is now. I'm currently living with one of my parents because I'm no longer able to support myself and everyday has been miserable. On top of this, my perception of reality (sounds, feelings, vision, depth perception, mental workings) is completely unstable and unpleasant, and this is why I take the Valium primarily. The heart/chest anxiety just recently started to be a HUGE issue. It's to the point where I'm unable to go for a short walk because I'm so afraid of what it will do to my heart-rate. My heart rate has been extremely high recently and I feel as if I'm walking on an emotional tight rope all day trying not to go into a full blown panic attack over my heart. So I'm essentially not able to do anything, all day long. And I really don't know what to do. How does this tie in to Mindfulness/ Meditation/ Spirituality? Well recently I've been looking into meditation and mindfullness as a potential answer to my problems, I've been reading the book \"The Power Of Now\" by Eckart Tolle, and theres some really good insight in that book but my issue is whenever I try to practice mindfulness, I'm unable to be mindful because I'm in such a physical/psychological discomfort + anxiety that putting my attention anywhere else than something to distract it, causes my anxiety and heart rate to severely increase. And even when I do have my moments of slight clarity (which is usually late in the night) trying mindfulness is extremely difficult for me because my perception of the current moment is extremely distorted due to benzodiazepines/ weird brain chemistry (or I believe so), so I don't really know if I'm experiencing the current moment or if I'm just in a different strange mental state. Any advice or suggestions on what I can do to help myself is greatly appreciated.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 59088, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Heart/ Chest Anxiety + Spiritual Depression &amp; Confusion/ Uncomfortable Perception", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569405768, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d8l18w/heart_chest_anxiety_spiritual_depression/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "onebodyonesoul", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_20ct7gzh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569317173, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d8kq68/for_the_past_month_the_thought_but_im_going_to/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d8kq68", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 26, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d8kq68/for_the_past_month_the_thought_but_im_going_to/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569317174, "score": 3, "selftext": "I see a parent with their child being happy\nMe: sad that they\u2019re going to be dead\n\nI keep going to school and trying to get A's\nBut WHY I\u2019m going to die anyway\n\nI see people working towards goals like if they\u2019re going to be here forever, they\u2019re going to die and that makes me feel sad. \n\nThe thought of seeing some beautiful landscape and knowing that I\u2019m going to die and won\u2019t be able to see it again keeps me away from enjoying outdoors, activities.\n\nI find myself doing stuff, working on something \nAnd then realizing I\u2019m going to die anyway and it ruins me\n\nIn the end, all is forgotten, in the end, nothing matters, hope is lost, lies prevail, and at the end, you disappear. \n\nThe thought of knowing that in 1,000 years I/we won\u2019t even be dust brings me down so much to the point I became suicidal now, and I\u2019m scared because that would hurt my immediate mother and grandma and don\u2019t want them to blame themselves or kill them with sadness if I kill myself.\n\nI\u2019m turning 27 soon, and this is what my life has come to.

I had just left my therapy when we broke up because I felt it wasn't working for me anymore, and some months later I left my last job, so I had lots of time to look inside and grow, mature thoughts and ideas. I've always tried to \"decipher\" the universe and the messages it sends us, but I have to confess I've been stubborn many times, and this used to cloud my judgement, or I wouldn't know what exactly I should be looking for because I wanted to be right at any cost. But I'm back on therapy and it's helping me sort my head out again, and now I kind of see these patterns of things happening. \n\nFor example: I'm a clumsy and absent-minded woman, so I'm always slipping, tripping, dropping or forgetting things. A while ago, I noticed I was breaking lots of things - plates, glasses, mugs. Now I've \"stopped\" breaking things and I noticed this pattern with fire. First the wires of my shower suddenly caught on fire (it turns out they were damaged inside the wall and I didn't know), then the fire inside my oven got really high and I had to call a guy to fix it, and today my mother's shower (which is new and shouldn't be already needing maintenance) burned when I was bathing at her place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese \"patterns\" happen in the period of a month of so. Then \"the current pattern\" stops and nothing happens for a few weeks or months and a new one comes. Does this happen to anyone or am I just crazy? I'd like to find a website or a book with \"universe signs\" maybe, or what each thing could mean, how to read these things, I don't know.

This scenario loosely depicts as what I would describe as \u201ccontrol\u201d.\n\nI would describe my fear as being in a position where the organism moves on its own. Controlled by external factors as I helplessly watch from behind the organisms eyes.\n\nI would further describe this fear as a fear of eternity; that is, never experiencing death. Not only would I be trapped inside the body for the duration of its life-span, but would also be trapped/tethered to its consciousness beyond that earthly life-span as the novelty of the current experience/density evolves - whatever that might mean.\n\nWhat I feel this is surrounding is a sort of \u201cjudgement\u201d, what Jesus described as not knowing the date nor the hour, which not even the angels know. The Self judging the soul.\nI am increasingly feeling myself not to be in control of my actions but rather ceasing a fight to a centre of control revolving around suppressing of traumas and avoiding emptiness.\n\nFinally, because I do not know much about the Self judgement, I will conclude my description of this fear as ... Self deeming my actions in this life to be unworthy, that I have \u201cchosen\u201d self-preservation over love to other-selves, and ULTIMATELY resulting in no-control over the body anymore. The body will be controlled exclusively by its flesh desires and \u201cI\u201d will be stuck behind a depersonalised screen observing these horrors to occur for eternity.\n\nIt may also be that a fifth-density entity has taken control of my body through my repressed anger/trauma and self-hatred and self-loathing and upon this \u201cself-judgement\u201d through my (unintentional) free will choice to follow what I feel is increasingly becoming clear to me as an entity operating through my subconscious in order to \u201cfatten me up\u201d for when it devours me and the \u201cself-judgement\u201d will be \u201cGod\u201d giving me over to this fifth-density entity in which I will be trapped behind my eyes for eternity as it\u2019s puppet, or plaything. It could also be an Ifrit djinn which has been working for many years to slowly possess my body for the purposes of creating more Hell and hybrids to further progress the plans of negatively polarised fifth and sixth density entities currently oppressing the vast majority of humans on the planet at this time.\n\nTo further clarify what I mean by \u201coperating through my subconscious\u201d I refer to the sum total of my external reality communicating with me; there seems to be no distinction made between forms. In other words, it is talking to me through symbols, places, events, and even directly through other people. It manifests as something feminine, and sarcastic (what I interpret as unsympathetic and indirect). While I divide it up into \u201csymbols, places, events and people\u201d it seems to be simultaneous across all these aspects, with the division described only being formed by my mental efforts to describe its \u201cspanning\u201d of my total experience.\n\nI do NOT want to be a puppet for this. I am increasingly feeling concerned and like giving up my fight altogether - you can read a couple of my previous posts if you want to understand that side of the horror from my perspective.\n\nWhat is Self-judgement?

All of the present emerges from Dreamtime to create our current Dreaming, to which we each add our own little dreams as best we can.  Dreaming happens at all levels producing various strands, threads, and fabrics of Dream which then get woven into the great tapestry of Dreamtime.  Each individual adds their strands, which then get woven into the Dreaming of their family.  All the various families weave their respective Dreamings into a Dreaming of their people.  Finally, all the various peoples weave their respective Dreamings into the Great Dreaming of Now.\n\nThe Dreaming comprises those connections between the fixed points of Dreamtime which a person CAN alter.

Dreamtime reflects the combination of the haziness our view becomes as we peer into the past with the increased size that the events and forces have to be to appear in our field of vision.\n\nThe speed with which an entity acts tends to be proportional to their size and length of their existence.  Homo sapiens understand ideas on a homo sapien scale, processing things of a certain size, and struggling to understand things significantly larger or smaller than their optimal conceptual size.

Likewise, the ancient beings of the past are NOT dead or gone, but rather they normally move at an entirely different pace than homo sapiens (homo divinus living for sar after sar (hundreds of thousands of years) placing them operating firmly at Dreamtime pace from homo sapien POV).\n\n**Dream Police**\n\nThe treks, the rituals, the ceremonies, the dances, the songs, the recipes, everything is part of the Dreaming and is needed to propel that Dreaming forward.

The processes which science explains through geology and evolution are instead explained as events in the Dreamtime.  It\u2019s not so much that one explanation is inherently superior to the other, but rather that they are simply alternative ways of expressing the same concept, and each is superior in its own domain.  \n\n**I Dreamt of a Snake**\n\nThe [Rainbow Serpent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Serpent) is the living embodiment of that primordial Divine Plan that takes on so many different names, [Tao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao), [Asha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asha), etc., crawling through and energizing the Dreaming.  The Rainbow Serpent takes on all the various roles by the Divine Plan at different times to different people(s), Creator, Sustainer, Destroyer.\n\nThe essence of the Divine Plan is a single start point, a single end point, and a diversifcation process expanding the original point.

The more I awaken to my relationship to GOD, the less I am motivated to live the life I\u2019m raised and conditioned to live. \n\nIt\u2019s not as simple as letting go of the things that don\u2019t serve me. \n\nThis lifestyle of being a productive cog in society is still in me, yet I know it\u2019s not serving me. \n\nI\u2019m left with being stuck between a life in society with where my friends and family are ... and the spiritual path dedicated to my relationship with GOD. I want to dedicate myself on this path. I want to jump in and embrace it, but I\u2019m unable to leave behind this materialistic life. \n\nI see no way to have a healthy balance between spirituality and living as a producer in society. I\u2019m unsure as to why there are two stark contrasts between the two. Perhaps my ego is addicted to the material world. Perhaps I\u2019m fearful to let go. What would that mean? It\u2019s as if I\u2019m on the edge of a cliff. Jumping off is to give my life to GOD and surrender everything I have identified with. I\u2019ve been living on the edge and peaking over occasionally to see glimpses of GOD, I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can do this. I feel the need to jump... but I\u2019m anchored to this toxic world. \n\nEach time I go back to my \u201cnormal life\u201d I feel alone, sad and with no purpose. \n\nWhen I am with like minded people who are also on this path, and who are positive role models for me in a setting dedicated to honouring GOD and the divine, I feel happy and pure. I feel safe, protected and loved. I also feel love and compassion for others. When I come back to my \u201creality\u201d I fall off of the spiritual path and I am consumed by egoic urges.

I was /u/discreet_troll, for a time, toiling away in the forums.  I mentioned from time to time I didn't find any cultures that wanted to hear me out.  I was banned from various communities, Norse, Pagan, now the Vets are shunning me.  I had a great sense of humor about this and was willing to humor everyone, it was just a bad experience thus far.  I was not nor am I a religious person, I have modern views and share most Atheist Logic. I think that and people are animals, morons, self destructive, any other generalization. The religious/spiritual allegiances with the Gods and Demons are here or there, some admittedly defend any smear job I do on these individuals.  Mass Murder, Rape, Embezzlement, Conspiracy, Piracy, Brain Washing, Sex Slavery - still got people licking their asses.  People love these mother fuckers...  Fuckin Motherless.  \n\nIt's been hell, literal hell, I'm sure it can get worse if some other deity swoops into command and has me shot in the head or some shit and re-establishes the 3rd Reich.  It would be very shitty for me and just a shitty end to my painful life,  a shitty end is was bars suicide as a solution to all this bullshit.  I was just trying to go back in the Army and get me some.\n\n  I had been threatened and pushed around and threatened.  I was constantly the victim of persecution and alienation and no one gave a damn, they just wanted to end the situation.   Keeping the status quo seemed to be the only desire and the confidentiality of all incidents over the years, red tape, paranormal, criminal.  This had been going on over a decade with the Gods and constant public incidents of them trying to meet me or publically humiliate me. \n\nI did quite well, I am a decent person..  Some petty crimes and a few heifers, I had sex with a lot of girls... Some of them were big, some weren't really pretty.  But, I never judge a book by its cover, and beauty is on the inside.  That bullshit isn't true, make sure their pretty on the outside, because they're..  You'll never know what's on the inside, sure as a fuck usually isn't beauty, it's weird on the inside of some women.  Then the stalking, they better stay in the shadows.\n\nI wanted to talk more about my performance in the Military.  Back in my previous Enlistment (Radio/25q :/ ) I was not at maximum potential. I didn't know a lot and was barely lucid back then.   I'm mostly talking PT wise, I was great, just not at maximum potential at the time.   I needed much more nurturing in my youth. I'm 6'1ft, 73\" tall around 220lbs (250lbs now). I'm reasonably well bred, Germanic American, strong, fast, competent, reasonably intelligent.  However, I'm  riddled with birth defects, minor ones, nothing crippling. I'm not a good example of an inferior male or soldier, but the example had been made in the past.  I performed well in theater, mostly security detail, guard duty. I went through some mortar attacks, 2 invasions, lots of movement, convoys, air time, it was amazing. I enjoyed much of the stimulation and danger, I live for the thrill of Battle.  The inhumanities and poor practices of chivalry were there.  There were women and children in complete destitution and devastation, that was traumatizing.  I had some humanity, I didn't want to decimate the women and kids too.\n\n I was struggling with poor nutrition and debilitating effects of food intolerances and inflammation.  I didn't learn binge drinking and fried food was horrible for you until much later.  Later before my whole life went to shit I was into 5 miles (8k) in 32 minutes, which is outstanding. The rest is child's play, I was just in amazing shape afterwards.  I'm all out of shape now, just fighting off the overwhelming stress.\n\nMoving on, I was on the right and militant.  I was a holy person or love or any of that shit, if I'm Jesus too. I do not know.  I was a ruthless individual for the most of my campaigns.  I had some reflection on past lives, nothing I could bonify with evidence or anyone vouching for my word.  I would rather not fill peoples heads with bullshit without evidence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll work on writing a book someday, it will be pretty good.  Full of bloodshed, war and carnage.  I'm not an egomaniac or delusional.  I had no reason to be so egoistic and I'm not diluted.  I'm completely confident in my abilities and enjoy the thrill of battle.  I expressed genuine morale, mettle and confrontational beliefs, I'm just a psychopath, apparently.  There is no morale here, just misery and hateful ass people. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther than that I am a bit of an alcy, I enjoy drinking and playing Battlefield.  I enjoy gaming and all, exercise, I stay in reasonably respectful shape off the couch.  Since I discovered nutrition and intermittent fasting, 16:8,18:6. OMAD/CICO, I've stayed quite fit naturally.  Off the couch I was doing 5k in 20 minutes np, I can get into shape in a few weeks time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat should do for now, so long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58978, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Stories about being a Karma Sutra Zeus", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569358652, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d8cstw/stories_about_being_a_karma_sutra_zeus/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "seagoonie", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_a43ua", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569271144, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d8cjer/is_awakening_or_enlightenment_enough/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d8cjer", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 16, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d8cjer/is_awakening_or_enlightenment_enough/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569271229, "score": 3, "selftext": "Is self-awareness enough?\n\nIs fulfillment enough?\n\nIs \u201cawakening\u201d or \u201cenlightenment\u201d enough?\n\nI contest it\u2019s not enough.

But animals and insects seen to love to approach me and i\u2019m not sure why. \nTo clarify, i don\u2019t just mean cats and dogs. I have had so many animal encounters and I don\u2019t know how to explain it or why. I had two different squirrels not only approach me but follow me, and a raccoon as well, multiple times. I even named the raccoon because i saw him so much (i lived in an apartment complex in the suburbs at this time so I know its the same one) he would approach me and follow me as well but showed no signs of aggression. I\u2019ve had chipmunks walk up to me and some even stand or walk across my feet. The place I currently live at has a very small section of woods in front of my patio thats maybe a 30 yds thick and maybe 100-200 yds long and the foxes will come out and stare at me then just walk right up to me or walk past me. The squirrels and birds get oddly close to me as well. Almost everytime i\u2019m on my patio I have an insect encounter too. Caterpillars seem to land on me and crawl on me, some even follow me by climbing up the chair to get to me and i will get up and it will crawl back down and make its way to me. I have spiders follow me too, some stare and try to approach me and others try to jump on me but again, no signs of aggression. They just want to crawl on me (i love spiders and don\u2019t mind). I had a garden orb weaver build a beautiful giant web over my patio, and they tend to hide during the day and are out at night. He stayed for two months and I named him Jerry and he was scared when everyone else approached him to look at him and he\u2019d run away but he just chilled whenever i passed by or got REALLY close to take pictured of him. In the past month alone, i\u2019ve had 8 caterpillars crawl on me and 12 spiders. I was out in the woods one time smoking and i was sitting against a tree and it was dark, and I heard noises and i got scared and locked my phone to not draw attention to myself, and i feel something soft slowly brush against me and i turn my flashlight on and got a small glimpse of tan fur. It ran out of the woods and under a street light and it was a cougar... pets that are mean, shy or aggressive love me too, and the owners get so shocked that they approach me like they know me. I\u2019ve seen many posts about just animals, especially pets, but not insects as well. I have bees and butterflies land on me as well, even wasps and i\u2019ve never gotten stung or bitten. The only insect that has ever bitten me is a mosquito lol and i\u2019ve never been bitten by an animal. I took two companion animal classes, beginning and advanced and there  were 208 animals in that class and not a single one disliked me. There were animals that hated everyone but loved me, even a feral rat that bit everyone. I was the only one who could handle him, clean his cage or just reach in there. I don\u2019t even know what community to put this under because its so strange to me, and its been like this since I was a kid but seems to get even more intense and consistent as I get older. Is it because they don\u2019t see me as a threat? Is it my scent? I don\u2019t understand fully but i\u2019ve always had a deep connection with mother nature and ever since I was a kid i\u2019ve loved just being in the woods and observing, and I love animals and insects so much and feel so connected with them regardless of the attraction to me.

Fast forward to a few months ago...I walk out my job, swore at my boss, punched the wall in the locker room, went home and cried, smoked a joint(right now I don't smoke and I was only smoking a little to de-stress when I got home) when I lit the joint I put on some music, some cool trippy mix came up on my SoundCloud. I can't remember exactly what happened but I can explain how it felt. It was like something washed over me, my negative thinking and all the social anxiety stuff was gone, it was scary and amazing at the same time But it quickly got out of control. As id never experienced something like this before I didn't know what it was, I felt crazy. I went to my doctor and told him I was going crazy as I started to forget where things were, completely lost track of time. I was awake for maybe 9 days with 4 hours sleep(I had no clue) I ended up being arrested and sectioned under the mental health act but after a week with some rest I was ready to leave the hospital with no medication or diagnosis. I still believe that something came down tell me to start loving myself more. I also felt like people sensed this was going to happen to me, is that possible?

I hope it finds you friend.\n\nAwakening is a beautiful thing. But with each level we awaken to there are new traps. A common trap is the fallacy that not killing animals for food is a morally \"advanced\" spiritual stance, vegan movement has even moved to call this, a \"moral baseline\". This is rooted in duality, and this is a trap. This is an identity your ego will cling to, keeping you from reaching higher levels. ALL life is sacred. ALL is energy. Those plants you kill for food, are no different than animals. When you see someone on the street, and you send them a negative judgement in that split second of your mind, that energy can be much worse than taking a life for sustenance. The importance of ALL food, whether plant or animal, is being cultivated with love and care. Give thanks for all you consume, whether plant or animal. Animals are not under the same enslavement and energy extraction matrix as we are. Their memory has not been wiped on arrival. They know what they are coming here for, whether being killed by a lion or a human. The lion knows which gazelle it is going to eat, before it even eats it. The chase is carried out because the story must go on. The gazelle is not running from death, it does not fear death - it is running towards life. But it knows before it even begins to run that it is it's time. It is just the way. \n\nEverything is happening as it should. It's hard to see the big picture from our small vantage point. Death is not important (another trap), you cannot kill what is eternal. This goes for plant, animal and even a human loved one. There is no death - only dismissal. This is not to say you shouldn't be vegan. By all means do what makes your soul happy. All this is saying is to stalk your thoughts and understand whether it is a true desire, or fuel for your ego. Are you only abstaining because of guilt? That will always hold back your spiritual progress. That energy must be cleared. Not everyone can thrive on a vegan diet, something many vegans will deny even to their own detriment. How can you be of service if you are not functioning optimally? If you need certain foods to nourish your body, you will be healthy and able to serve to your fullest capacity. Our bodies have all been modified from the original template, and some do better on animal foods, don't feel guilty for it and give thanks. Find someone who loves and cares for their animals and buy from them. But make no mistake, there is no \"higher vibrational diet\", eating all raw fruits and vegetables as some may make you believe. Your soul will not be damned for eating flesh. Your vibration comes from the strength of spirit and the focus of the mind. Therefore stalk your thoughts, understand they are not all your own. Weed out the voices which are there to trick you and develop your discernment. May your mind become the beacon in the veil of the night, and as sharp as a spear to pierce through that which confines us, when the time comes.\n\nLearn to develop your own voice and your own intuition. When you follow a \"path\" or way of teaching from a religion, guru, or philosophy you can often become bound. There are many paths to enlightenment, and yes some of these paths can take you there. But they are slow and winding. You also must realize when you subscribe to these ideologies, you are giving your mind and your consciousness to these constructs. Why are you giving your energy away? Where is your consciousness going? You need it to propel yourself forward. Do not give it away. Why do you waste your time following others when all you need is inside you? There is a direct connection to what you seek, waiting for you. You just need to clear the chatter of the mind and follow the only real voice. It will not lead you astray. \n\n//.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58862, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A message for someone struggling with conscience of diet", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569303175, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d827qd/a_message_for_someone_struggling_with_conscience/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "usernamealrdytakn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kaud2l2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569216739, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d827f2/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1829/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d827f2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Enlightenment"}], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d827f2/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1829/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569216739, "score": 1, "selftext": "**TRANSLATION**\n\n**Now, O winner of wealth, please listen as I tell you in detail of the three kinds of understanding and determination according to the three modes of nature.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nNow after explaining knowledge, the object of knowledge and the knower, in three different divisions according to modes of material nature, the Lord is explaining the intelligence and determination of the worker in the same way.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the three factors which motivate action ?

People can waste a lot of time in their life as well as cause great detriment because of this. \n\nIve done and fed into things because of so called signs and connecting dots and ideas and giving my own belief to them just to find myself in difficult predicaments.\n\nAlso human beings tend to have either a more left brain hemisphere or right brain hemisphere dominance. One being a more logical and practical side and the other being a more whimsical and creative side. Depending on this, they are either more likely or less likely to believe in spiritual phenomenon. Which is why you have people who dont believe in anything like demons ghosts religion and other stuff thats hard to prove.\n\nAlso, ironically, many of the people who hang around spirituality forums or chatrooms spend way too much time in the digital. Definitely not very spiritual.\n\nAlot of these spiritual ideas which can be called \"new age\" idealogies have almost no real backing scientifically or historically.. ie: twinflames.. which was started by one of the thousands of cult like organizations in the 60s. \n\nThe sad part about such idealogies is that vulnerable people really believe in them and it can cost them alot. For example with twinflames you constantly hear how people stuck with very toxic situations and relationships because of a mystical belief that it was all spiritual.\n\nOur bodies and brains work very logically so why do we put so much emphasis on to spiritual phenomenon? Much of which cant be proven by science or other anecdotal evidence. \n\nConstantly looking for signs and creating your own dots to connect on spirituality or using spiritual ideas tends to be like a dog chasing its own tail.\n\nInstead learn to look at things logically and pragmatically and its hard to go wrong.

How I have changed mentally and emotionally. I used to let things affect me so much, my emotions controlled me and my actions. Now, I still feel them, but not as intense and I can work through it. The inner voice is controllable and is a lot nicer too. I take more risk and I've learned to appreciate myself and what I have or can do more. Obviously, more work to be done, I don't think it's truly ever over, till it's over.... Whatever that may be, but I'm more excited. I guess my point is it gets better, and then it might get shitty again for some time but you can always keep working on moving forward. \n\nMeditation has really helped me feel more powerful and taking risks even if they're small.. I smoked weed for 13 plus years and I've stopped because I got pregnant. Having a child is something I never thought I would do, but now that it's happening I think I felt that way because I was so scared. I couldn't even deal with myself let alone another human being. Now I'm going to be a mom and I'm working on my degree, I'm single and there's still a lot of unknowns but I feel more prepared to take them on. Excited for what the universe can bring me. Staying positive helps. \n\nI say this for anyone having a rough time. Keep working on it. Keep asking for guidance, help, direction.

God constantly tests you and your will, your will's purity.\n\nExpect many Dark Nights of The Soul - until you're pure, you're gonna get them.\n\nYou have tasted the forbidden fruit of True Knowledge.\nBy this, you have signed up to be cast from all the good things the ordinary human world\nmay normally bless you with. Paradise Lost, but not forever.\n\nBy tasting DMT, you have signed up for long term suffering.\n\nThis suffering is synonymous with purgatory, purification by God's fire.\n\nUntil the purification is 100% complete, you are not allowed back\nto enjoy the wonders of the ordinary human world. Period.\n\nGod will never ask you to commit suicide - the serpent might. Fuck the serpent.\n\nSURRENDER, LITTLE BITCH. God is love and pure reason.\n\nInability to surrender completely results in schizophrenia and physical illness.\n\nDeny the Tempter, the snake, in each waking minute, and even in your dreams.\n\nIf it catches you off-guard, you're done for. Don't let it. By surrendering to God,\nthe Serpent's will is non-existant. \nThe Serpent is Dead.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58753, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Tempt me no more, ye serpent of Truth", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569268678, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d7vmsg/tempt_me_no_more_ye_serpent_of_truth/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Libra91xo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4igfnwrr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569180227, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d7v5p3/need_all_the_protection_around_me/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d7v5p3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d7v5p3/need_all_the_protection_around_me/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569180230, "score": 0, "selftext": "I need all the protection around me, and if you can send help close portals and having light around me would help as well. \n\nCurrently my twinflame and I are in separation.

I\u2019ve kept my distance because once again, I gave him what he wanted and I didn\u2019t want to come off needy. After we were done with the most passionate sex we\u2019ve had, he told me about this demonic entity that has been with him sense he was little. He even gave me the name of the entity. I then asked him if he is able to control him and he said that he can. \n\n2. I was in a very high vibration for the last two weeks of seeing him. Since the last full moon things went down hill. I was attached by multiple energies when I went out with my best friend. It put me in a very low vibration. So low that I kept to myself and stayed in my house. In the same week; my two year old healthy dog died. \n\n3. My best friend and soul tribe sister read my cards. She asked if the entity ( which I will not say ) killed my dog due to me being in a high vibration and going on my own path. Which was making my twin be in a better thought place and definitely getting closer to me since he brought me up about him. She confirmed that he did exactly killed my dog. The moment she told me all i can hear is this dark evil laugh in my ear. \n\n3. The day after my best friend read my cards, i was told by another person in my tribe that now my twinflame is in a relationship. And I definitely feel this entity is definitely stuck with me as well.

It has allowed me to confront my ghosts and start healing. It has also allowed me to improve on all the good things. \n\nI am ever so grateful that I made the decision to go down the spiritual path. I once again am starting to see the light in everything. I am beginning to feel as though I am part of something much bigger than just me. Every day I feel less like hiding away and more like sharing all that I have to offer with the world.

He forgives everyone and everything.\n\nNonetheless, someone is sending darkness to certain parts of his body. He knows this because he wipes his nether regions with wipes ( cleansing wipes or towelettes) and they become tainted and eventually his nether regions become cleaner and fair. Then sometime passes and it darkens again (randomly, sometimes he will wake up and notice that someone has been unkind while he slept ) . He notices that it is happening to the nether regions and to the back of his legs (even his posterior) almost as if whoever is sending this darkness does not want him to find out. He want to be clean and fair because he wishes to please the lady in his life (whenever she decides to come over to love him).\n\nHe loves peace and everything good and wants the same for all. \n\nWhat could be causing this? what can he do to improve upon himself? He would like all to be fair and beautiful from the inside and outside (but particularly from the inside). If someone is fair from the inside they ought to be fair on the outside and if someone is not so fair on the inside then may they at least be fair on the outside. Now if someone is only fair from the outside then it is imperative that they be fair from the inside too to match their attractive exterior.

I\u2019ve been steadily exploring my interest in spirituality. In 7th grade, I started seeing repeating numbers very frequently, and it still continues (in 10th now!). I\u2019ve never had a belief in God, as I was raised athiest/agnostic. Yet spirituality intrigues me, though I always have a bit of skepticism in me. But I was watching a video about spirit guides, and establishing communication with them. I relaxed, asked for their name. Two names popped up immediately, Ezekiel and Tobias. These names came up so quickly and effortlessly. I hadn\u2019t met people with these names, I simply don\u2019t know why they would pop up, of all names ever. I looked up their names, and angel/archangel Ezekiel popped up, easing transformation. That validated what I was thinking!

I see the Bible as literature that is mostly figurative. I see Jesus as a spiritual teacher. \n\nI lean toward universal energy that is a source we all draw from.  I believe we are all connected by it.  I do practice candle rituals, tarot, and manifestation techniques as well.  I don\u2019t label my beliefs.  I just simply say that I am spiritual.  \n\nI have had several God dreams.  One in particular God spoke to me directly saying \u201cI am God and I have made you a pathway of roses that will lead you home.\u201d   I had never heard of the book written by Christian Larsen in the 1800s called Pathway of Roses.  It explains God in terms that I understand.    I found it after the dream, knowing that I must not be the only person who\u2019s gotten that message.  Last night I had dreams of angel voices singing.  It was a beautiful song about how obstacles would be removed.   It was followed by nightmares and a young woman asking me why we talk to God so much but he hardly ever talks to us.  Then a reply came... not from me.  It said because God doesn\u2019t have any questions.  We do.  \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve also had some very powerful life experiences.   There too many to get into.  But my question is this...  I was raised to believe that God would only give visions and messages to his \u201cfollowers\u201d and I have rejected religion. By all accounts, I\u2019m what you\u2019d call a \u201cwitch\u201d.  Why has God chosen to speak with me when he never has before? Why would God choose me?  Am I not what would be associated with evil?   It\u2019s odd to me because I have never requested God to speak with me directly.  I\u2019ve only sought to know the truth in connection with source energy and universal laws.  \n\nI somehow know that I\u2019m not being judged based on personal belief but rather being matched with a wisdom I seek.

\n\nThe thing about spirituality is that if everyone was born being able to speak to the after life (medium) they would not be the person they are now. They would be too caught up in the spiritual that anything else would not matter.\n\nFor example Bruce Lee would not have been a martial artist and Micheal Jackson would not have been a singer. They came to be closed off from the spiritual so that life can develop their personality and desires. Leading them to live the life they were living. Creativity and art would not be pursued as much because it's the closed off spiritual life that perpetuates it in the first place.

I\u2019m a 19 year old girl that just started to live alone. \n\nNormally, I\u2019m a quiet, introverted, not-talkative person. I\u2019m the student that sits at the back, studies a lot, doesn\u2019t have any friends. But all of that was okay with me, because I\u2019m the only child anyway. Plus, people didn\u2019t want to be friends with me because I was reading or drawing the whole school year. But as I said, that was okay.\n\nThis year, everything changed. I moved to another city, started to live on my own. And after 19 years, I wanted to take care of myself. Not just physically, mentally too. I like learning new things (I\u2019m a big nerd and science-lover) so I tried to find new ways to improve myself. Then, I found spiritualism. The energy, the chakras, the frequencies... they amazed me. Even though I still don\u2019t know if they are scientifically proven or not, they can make me feel like I\u2019m loving and doing something good for myself. I started meditating. I started to read spiritual books. \n\nI have very bad anxiety and bipolar disorder, but meditating made me forget about my responsibilites. Even though I\u2019m an atheist, spiritualism (and shamanism) made me feel like I\u2019m connected with nature.\n\nBut the thing is, I feel lots of changes are happening. The way I look to the mirror, the way that I\u2019m thinking and communicating with others. Maybe you won\u2019t believe it but I think that I can foresee things better. Sometimes that change is hard, in 19 years I had 4-5 friends, but they didn\u2019t want to talk with me after the changes in my life. So is that okay? Is it something that I have to experiment? I need some opinions.

Some pieces left with an alleviating sense of release and others with the pain of being doused with acid or skinned alive. The big ones lasted for days or weeks sometimes and brought a loss that is very hard to explain other than calling it a personal death full of grief and sorrow. And they are still coming. \n\nOnly now the layers are going deeper and it seems like my mind is melting away now too, just like the perceived physical world. My brain no longer functions the same as it\u2019s became hard to think.

It was a wonderful time I was so happy and we were so similar to each other. So we had a great time until things were shifting.\n\nWe started to have less contact and more shallow and the only one who initiated conversations was me and those were short and shallow. We had long periods where we had no contact at all during this three years.\n\nYesterday I reflected about our relationship and I wanted to ask her if everythings fine and she said she can't talk right now. So I got sad... really sad...\n\nI came to the conclusion it can't go on like this so from now on I will stop texting her because it costs me too much energy to maintain this relationship. I idealized her too much, I clung on that perfect image of her that we are a good match but nothing happened ever and that's okay.\n\nI think she was a soulmate to me but she rather was a lesson than an actual \"mate\".

But some of the beliefs in this religion are flawed and can be far fetched. And people are often really arrogant in this religion. I\u2019m tired of being judged and not accepted just because I don\u2019t live to their standards. So I\u2019ve been slowly losing faith. \n\nNow I\u2019ve been looking into different religions to get some insight on different beliefs. And it seems there are many religions make claims that their religion is the \u201cright\u201d religion. And you have to live by certain standards in order to be accepted. The religions I\u2019m referring to are Christianity, Judaism, Islam, etc. but I\u2019m sure there are lots more. \n\nI\u2019ve also looked into Atheism, but it\u2019s pretty much the same deal. Most Atheists are extremely arrogant and think their superior to people who believe in any sort of religion. This is not all people of course. But the majority that I\u2019ve seen in my life are like this. And on top of this I just don\u2019t see the world being created by itself. I personally believe some sort of being had to of created the universe. Not necessarily \u201cGod\u201d but a creator. So these reasons have made me stray from atheism.\n\nThe main thing I\u2019m struggling with is how do I know what religion is right. Because every religion claims that it is right. And I\u2019m honestly scared of believing in the wrong thing and possibly going to hell. I\u2019m scared of straying away from my Christian beliefs because I\u2019ve always had faith in god and I\u2019m scared of turning away and going to hell. But at the same time, what if this religion is not the right way. \n\nHonestly I\u2019ve found myself agreeing with many of the beliefs in Buddhism. I just find it to be one of the few peaceful and not so flawed religions. But again at the same time I\u2019m scared of turning away from my Christian beliefs. \n\nHow can I figure out what is the right path and what is closest to the truth?

I talked a little about glimpses into what i can only guess is the future and about 50mins ago a ton of flashes like glimpses started to happen and it' just now starting to slow down. What i mean by flashes is, a movies worth of frames put into just 1 and then played. it feels likes pure information slamming into my mind. i don't know what 's happening. Last post i mentioned something happening this friday coming and more information is being shown that proves it happening, from actual information i'v found out and from these \"flashes\" i'm gonna be completely honest with yall. i don't understand a damn thing thats happening to me let alone if this is the right place to put it but i feel like i cant go to anyone about this kind of stuff. the whole world is filled with science and taking meds to stop this and that and shit that society has put around spirituality and it being a whole bunch of \"hippy bullshit\"  i can't go to anyone and i'm to afraid of even joining an anon online group that talks about this kind of stuff because my anxiety makes me believe that they'll think i'm crazy. I dont know anyone to talk to about how i can see music as colors or feel the vibrations of the words said in the songs. i can't tell people about the conversations i'v had with things inside my dreams. i can't tell people about times i'v had out of body experiences or memories that aren't mine or seeing the future or anything. It feels like the world vibrates differently than i do. like me and the world aren't synced. and as an empath with anxiety it amplifies the belief that people won't believe me or understand even tho i know they will. anyway back to what i was talking about before i went on my rant, these flashes are feel like shock waves of information in my head of images or even seeing things from other peoples perspectives.  The feeling when the flashes happen was like an electronic stimulation of the brain (idk that's just how i'd describe it) or a flood of pulses like how your head feels whenever you enter a flow state and someone snaps you out of it. It felt like. it also felt like a pulse of electricity from behind my eyes like the neurons in my brain and the veins in my eyes were flooded with electricity.

Simply the brain processing information or is there a deeper spiritual meaning to them?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58622, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What are dreams?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569202572, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d7jybc/what_are_dreams/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "redditkk18", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_22fyz1sa", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569110455, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d7irb3/my_take/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d7irb3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d7irb3/my_take/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569110510, "score": 54, "selftext": "So you start with being aware of your thoughts be aware of what kind of thoughts you have, you have thoughts about the past abt the future most likely you will have negative thoughts. Each time you become aware of the thought that comes in your head, you will stop it, stop that thought because the \nthe awareness takes over the thinking and every time you do that you'll start thinking less and less. So now that you are thinking less and less bring your awareness to the present. What's happening around you, immediately around you, be an observer of the things that happen, don't be a reactor. Life is actually lived in snapshots, the brain makes it into a movie: the Self; is created by the brain from the past and the future. There are two places in the brain that light up when you think about the past and those two same places light up in your brain when you think about the future. Your brain makes a reel, a movie, when you are actually living in a moment. You need the sense of Continuum, like story telling. This sense of self  is a shallow reality, you have your attachments, you have your vices- it all helps you manage your time space existence.\n\nBut you need to live deeper you need to connect to the real you which is energy, everything is emanating energy, every single moment and each ounce of energy collectively creates a universal vibrational energy(source). We are part of that vibration and the frequency at which we are vibrating is not the same as the frequency of source energy(collective energy). When you live only a shallow life and you focus on your thoughts and all the stuff about being human, what will people think, what do I wear, fears about the future, regrets about the past, that's living in the shallow waters. You are vibrating at a different frequency you have to go deep and touch source energy. In order to connect with source energy you need to vibrate on a different frequency.  When you quiet your mind you vibrate at the frequency that will connect you to your source. You want to vibrate at the same frequency as sources energy not mind body experience.\n \nSo once you create enough awareness you can then do meditation. These are things you do to control the mind cuz of the fact that you have a body and a mind and the mind is the operating system, dont let the operating system take over your awareness which is your connection to source energy. You  can also at night before going to bed make a list of three things that you are grateful for that day, practicing gratitude is very important, another way is affirmative statements; always say them in the present, singing helps, listening to music.\nWhen you start doing this things, you'll start feeling like you're floating when you get into a state of Contentment Joy Bliss try to be aware and then stay in that mood longer when you stay in your happy mood(vibrating at the same frequency as source energy)that's when you ask for things, daydream, let your imagination go wild, in order for these things to manifest . Because you're tapped into Source energy to receive. Whenever you have that giddy feeling like a moment you know you're really good, that's you tapping into Source Energy(vibrating at same frequency). That's where you can receive ideas, solutions, make good plans(manifestations happen). The more you practice staying in that Blissful State, the longer you will be connected. So when you are in that state you're vibrating at a different frequency which is allowing you to connect with your Source energy and open yourself to receive; ideas will flow, creativity will flow, a sense of Peace will flow, you sense contentment and satisfaction. You are open to receive. That is ik onkar, it's the one we have to connect with.\nYou can change frequency according to your needs. You have to live your human life too, that's where purpose comes in.

I find it quite interesting and i was hoping you guys could share your thoughts and help me find out more about it since there seems to have no information on the internet. Here is a part where the person explains what griffin energy is:\n\n\"Griffin energy is a universal energy at a level that might be difficult to connect with because it\u2019s very otherworldly. It\u2019s one of the highlevel energies that gives aid to bonding the instinct of kinds. It should not be used by people who are flippant towards energy. Confident? Yes. Arrogant? No. Griffin Energy is powerful because it immediately makes shifting your being in degrees with focus happen at an accelerated rate subconsciously. By engaging conscious level instinct protocols. It\u2019s very powerful to use it as a subliminal, because that\u2019s it\u2019s the main seat of power. It reads all you can\u2019t process or see. It brings an astounding awareness that is simple and profound. Dragon and Centaur energies bowl you over with their high-level intensity intellect. Griffin runs the energy of instinct. The hidden intellect at a supernova beyond otherworldly understanding, without appearing to be anything more than what you can personally take from it. It\u2019s very measured in how it proceeds with you. Very instinctive with your instincts. A profound teacher that speaks by showing you how to teach yourself. Griffin energy is very foreign to human consciousness. It\u2019s going to feel very different to those who are on the path of strictly human. Those who are doing some really revolutionary changes, it\u2019s your absolute best friend energy. It really brings everything together that\u2019s beyond current level understanding. For instance, all that\u2019s really unnecessary to know to get something done. It\u2019s not necessary to know consciously how to imprint certain codes. Griffin energy is that bridge builder. The connecting intelligence that doesn\u2019t really fit into any realm, but creates cohesive connections on many different levels.\n\nRegarding Griffin Energy and Sexuality - This is just how Griffin energy is. Griffin isn\u2019t for those who are in the process of trying to change their sex from one form to the other. This isn\u2019t for anyone who has deep issues with the masculine or feminine sexes for any reason. Do not use this if your trying to change your sex regardless from what to what. Griffin energy has a universal code directive to ensure clan. A destiny code priority. It will not only stop that change immediately, it could bring up some past things people like to bury that are very painful. If that\u2019s your personal choice to try to change your sex, do not use Griffin energy as it will counter it. Why does Griffin energy counter it? When your born form is male or female and you're trying to reprogram the mind and body to be different. In this transition stage, it\u2019s a mind lie to the original genetics to Griffin energy. Griffin energy would take an immediate defensive posture to align the code of male and female with the original code. So if you're transitioning to change it, Griffin will read the intention as a universal lie and seek to correct it. It will seek to \u201ccorrect\u201d your instinct to re-align with the form your born with and enable you to successively have a male to female pairing for clan sake. Just so all is understood, a caution again if your choosing to change your sex don\u2019t use Griffin energy. What about if I\u2019m not trying to change my sex but deep inside I have a strong dislike of the opposite sex? Heal first then use it. It\u2019s going to immediately go for the reason you hold animosity towards the opposite sex to help you. Most people choose to not deal with why they hold an armored response against the opposite sex content to allow those feelings to dictate their life path. Have it very clear in your mind why you want to use Griffin energy. Then proceed to allow it to determine how to teach you. \n\nThis energy isn\u2019t like Dragon or Centaur that is so high above it naturally rebuffs by not connecting. Griffin energy will posture back and make you see the truth you try to hide if your intentions aren\u2019t noble or pure. Griffin energy can choose to kick your ass for even trying to lie to it. Griffin energy rules the mirror. You will not be able to lie to it. Griffin energy will pierce the veils of your own mind, heart, past through your bones to your destiny. It will generously help in its strange and elusive way if your purpose is sound and good. It holds the right and will to defensive posture against any kind trying to use it inappropriately. If you push a lie into the cosmos and ask Griffin energy to fund it, then expect not only a refusal but a memo as to why it\u2019s being refused. It could be a gentle nudge or not so gentle a nudge. Griffin energy is the epitome of appropriate measured response so let that be telling. Will Griffin energy physically harm you? Not only no, but an emphatic no. However, it will show you in its own distinct way why you are harming yourself. It will show you why you're really choosing the path. It\u2019s very powerful in aiding great change and correcting false imprints upon your being. It rewrites instinct code with perfection. If you're trying to become another kind for a noble reason then Griffin energy is absolutely essential. It enables your full transformation safely and correctly. If you're trying to elevate your bloodline and become a Superkind. Then this can aid you as long as your motives are pure. With the intention to progress forward for better genetics. Griffin energy will engage you. If there\u2019s deep trauma that a person is refusing to acknowledge it will come to light. It\u2019s better to heal first so the mind isn\u2019t automatically set up for extreme defensive postures. This requires a person to be emotionally stable enough for great change. If you\u2019ve tried to heal yourself and nothing worked, then diving in willingly with Griffin energy could be the answer. It\u2019s for each to decide intuitively if this is the next step in the epic journey of life. Griffin energy will not push you past what you can endure. It will push you past what you think you should take, until you realize your potential is in your hands. It doesn\u2019t sit with a long intellectual discourse. It plays with you beating you at your own games. Getting you out of your head and into your life. It\u2019s fun-loving for the sad and weary. Reminding someone to smile and laugh. Perpetuating an aura of healing that envelopes even the most traumatized of souls. It\u2019s very beneficial to the wounded, but it won\u2019t treat you like a victim but helps you puzzle out your victory dance for life. \n\nGriffin energy is by far my personal most and that\u2019s the best way to say it \u201cmy personal most\u201d used energy of the spectrums. Dragon and Centaur energies do not play. Griffin energy will \u201cplay\u201d with you. Its purpose is to help you learn. Enable your code to learn or relearn. It\u2019s associated historically with books because it reads you and then provides a lesson so you can read yourself. It is a great help. It\u2019s that \u201cjust what you needed\u201d to figure things out or accomplish your goal. The labyrinth of yourself becomes mapped out effortlessly. When you\u2019ve put forth the proper effort. The map of your heart. The destiny of your bones. The fingerprints imprinted from the womb. Every scar you\u2019ve ever got. How many hairs on your head. Griffin energy pays attention to all the many details and analyzes you quickly. Determines what you need efficiently. Then chooses to help you or waits until you want it more than the moment you're seeking. Griffin energy is the stabilizer of home energy. The sense of home, companionship, and all manner of instinctive clan dynamics. Home and hearth it builds the fibers of the \u201cI am home\u201d mindset. It creates a tremendous amount of desire to create a home reflecting your deepest desires to fulfill your truest needs. Planetary genius in my humble opinion. Griffin energy enables someone to create a world that\u2019s right for them with honest integrity and a symbol of truth shining bright. It demands an uncluttered mind, heart and physical space. Suddenly you won\u2019t be able to stand the disorganized mess or the wrappers in the car. The excessive lint on the shirt because it reflects upon you. Griffin energy doesn\u2019t like disorder of any kind. You can be as beautifully diverse and even snarky by nature if that\u2019s your truth. Then Griffin energy helps. It doesn\u2019t hinder. However, if your snarky because you're miserable due to something you don\u2019t really understand. Then Griffin energy will \u201chelp\u201d you out. Hello, Mirror meet True Self... true self meet Mirror Acting out of Self. It\u2019s wonderfully helpful to have all your bull laid bare before your eyes, so you can determine the best way to deal with it. Griffin energy doesn\u2019t \u201cdeal\u201d with you. It shows you what you need to \u201cdeal\u201d with and maybe why if it\u2019s important. Sometimes people are disorganized in their heart. So they overcompensate by reflecting order in their life with a pristine house that never gets ruffled. Griffin energy may inspire that person to get a little messy with paint. Help them draw an emotion they can\u2019t name. Such as writing, \u201cI will succeed losing my grief weight\u201d with lipstick on the mirror. \u201cOut of stagnate character is the motion forward into stumbling light.\u201d Lycan Clan saying. Griffin energy embodies this action. The universal purpose of Griffin energy is to do just that help move forward towards the right path. It\u2019s the great corrector of imbalances, and ensures there\u2019s clan into perpetuity.\n\n The Lycan lore speaks of when The Guardian Wolf and his mate first appeared to the energies present. The Griffin energy called out a warning. There was unseen things in The Mist watching. Griffin energy understood The Guardian Wolf deserved it\u2019s instinctive stance to be rewarded with information. Like all Shapeshifter kinds who were molded from this Epic pairing idea. It responded first as friend. All took note of the defensive posture of The Guardian Wolf to not allow his mate to pass further. This is what pleased the energies witnessing the encounter or as Lycans say, \"The Coming into a new form.\u201d Griffin energy took a defensive posture for the pair and flapped it\u2019s wings to the assembly. Letting all know that Griffin energy approved. Griffin energy would protect this kind. Griffin energy is very protective over all Shapeshifter kinds. It doesn\u2019t mean Griffin energy pampers. Instead Shapeshifters get the learning on the fast track scale. Let\u2019s see how fast you can learn to do this right is a favorite game of Griffin energy. All respect for the wisdom of clarity. If anything, human endeavors will be more likely to be pampered. Simply because human doesn\u2019t process otherworldly at a high ratio. The most beautiful aspects of Griffin energy is how it teaches you to be your own best friend. The world really isn\u2019t against you but for your greater good. It teaches you acceptance but also to question and not just accept anything. It keeps you from living a spoon-fed reality life of someone else\u2019s ideas of identity. Fostering a perspective in you of an ill-fitting form. It lays a foundational instinct that is completely in sync with your life purpose. It doesn\u2019t judge what that purpose is or how you should go about it. Instead it seeks to ensure there\u2019s a universal alignment with your destined purpose, heartsong and mind matrix patterns. It enables you to feel complete. Make better use of whatever energy is available to you for prosperity. Griffin Energy is the facilitator of rite of passage to clear destiny. It helps remove the delusion of detours and put us back on the path of a rightful claimed destiny of plenty, of abundance, of the true Universal definition of Life. The Universe wastes nothing. It's completely efficient. It's not setup on any scale for doing wrong to profit anyone in any realm. This is law and it expounds to all kinds in all ways it can be perceived. It's illogical and futile to deny yourself the full breadth of ability that the laws setup for all can provide. The greatest confusion to me as I've observed in all of history, in every era written and orally known, humans keep lusting after the power of rulership over all things without seeing the beauty of mastering themselves. All that\u2019s involved in family is part of Griffin energy scope and the coming into maturity. Learning about yourself and finding your place in the world. The pulsing heartsong of finding, seeking, desiring mate, marriage, children, financial security, and a firm foundation for all generations. Think of Griffin energy as the force in the Universe that ensures the seed of breath wasn\u2019t wasted with just one life perspective. Instead it helps a person invest wisely in themselves for future greatness. Creating a measured lineage algorithm for your future installments nurtured in universal achievement. To Griffin energy why not make the journey fun, interesting, or compelling? A paradox of complexity that manages to work out? So now you can make an informed choice. The Griffin force asks would you like to play a game? Play the game of your life until you learn to win at it?\"", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58602, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Need help!

He was the first boy who ever paid any attention to me. We never dated but looking back I feel there were strong feelings on both sides. Anyway, I fell in love with him - hard. \n\nWe were friends for a couple years when one night he hurt me very badly. He said something to me that was completely unforgivable  and it was, and easily is, still the single most painful things someone has ever said to me in my life. Oddly enough it didn\u2019t really end our friendship at the time, but it was definitely the catalyst to the end - it would end a few months later. \n\nAnyway, I held onto this for a looong time; 6 or so years. He hasn\u2019t been apart of my life in a long time, I\u2019ve moved on, I\u2019ve healed, and I\u2019ve found *true* love. Yet he still pops up in my dreams... pretty frequently.

I revere them when they live in tribes and families, in forests and groves. And even more I revere them when they stand alone. They are like lonely persons. Not like hermits who have stolen away out of some weakness, but like great, solitary men, like Beethoven and Nietzsche. In their highest boughs the world rustles, their roots rest in infinity; but they do not lose themselves there, they struggle with all the force of their lives for one thing only: to fulfil themselves according to their own laws, to build up their own form, to represent themselves. Nothing is holier, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree. When a tree is cut down and reveals its naked death-wound to the sun, one can read its whole history in the luminous, inscribed disk of its trunk: in the rings of its years, its scars, all the struggle, all the suffering, all the sickness, all the happiness and prosperity stand truly written, the narrow years and the luxurious years, the attacks withstood, the storms endured. And every young farmboy knows that the hardest and noblest wood has the narrowest rings, that high on the mountains and in continuing danger the most indestructible, the strongest, the ideal trees grow.\n\nTrees are sanctuaries. Whoever knows how to speak to them, whoever knows how to listen to them, can learn the truth. They do not preach learning and precepts, they preach, undeterred by particulars, the ancient law of life.\n\nA tree says: A kernel is hidden in me, a spark, a thought, I am life from eternal life. The attempt and the risk that the eternal mother took with me is unique, unique the form and veins of my skin, unique the smallest play of leaves in my branches and the smallest scar on my bark. I was made to form and reveal the eternal in my smallest special detail.\n\nA tree says: My strength is trust. I know nothing about my fathers, I know nothing about the thousand children that every year spring out of me. I live out the secret of my seed to the very end, and I care for nothing else. I trust that God is in me. I trust that my labor is holy. Out of this trust I live.\n\nWhen we are stricken and cannot bear our lives any longer, then a tree has something to say to us: Be still! Be still! Look at me! Life is not easy, life is not difficult. Those are childish thoughts. Let God speak within you, and your thoughts will grow silent. You are anxious because your path leads away from mother and home. But every step and every day lead you back again to the mother. Home is neither here nor there. Home is within you, or home is nowhere at all.\n Herman Hesse\n\nA longing to wander tears my heart when I hear trees rustling in the wind at evening. If one listens to them silently for a long time, this longing reveals its kernel, its meaning. It is not so much a matter of escaping from one's suffering, though it may seem to be so. It is a longing for home, for a memory of the mother, for new metaphors for life. It leads home. Every path leads homeward, every step is birth, every step is death, every grave is mother.\n\nSo the tree rustles in the evening, when we stand uneasy before our own childish thoughts: Trees have long thoughts, long-breathing and restful, just as they have longer lives than ours. They are wiser than we are, as long as we do not listen to them. But when we have learned how to listen to trees, then the brevity and the quickness and the childlike hastiness of our thoughts achieve an incomparable joy. Whoever has learned how to listen to trees no longer wants to be a tree. He wants to be nothing except what he is. That is home. That is happiness.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58500, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Home is nowhere at all", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569130943, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d76oar/home_is_nowhere_at_all/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Yellewleaves", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1ulnvhjs", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569043956, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d76l0f/we_are_all_connected_to_each_other_biologically/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d76l0f", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d76l0f/we_are_all_connected_to_each_other_biologically/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569043957, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58501, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "We are all connected; To each other, biologically.

I experienced what was to me, complete bliss, clarity, genuine joy, and peace. Words cannot describe these states of mind. Every event, every circumstance, every person, words, nothing seemed to bother me. It\u2019s as if I noticed everything yet felt nothing. Nothing in a sense of awareness if that makes sense. I lost it because I fell into a trap which I knew wasn't right but didn\u2019t realize the extent of the horrors that were to come with it. I fell in love with a girl and after she started to distance herself from me, jealousy, hatred and anger began to rise up. Due to my recent experience, it barely shook me, I would just watch the thoughts and emotions like watching a movie with the distance of the viewer and the movie itself, resting in the natural state if you will. Simply watching it rise and fall. My brother(twin) who also was on this spiritual journey with me(same symptoms) would see the mistakes I was doing and he would lecture me but I didn't see him as a teacher so every lecture and advice he gave me I would mostly ignore. I tried as much as I could to simply let go of the attachment but I guess I fell short. However, looking back, I didn\u2019t want to fully let go.\n\nBefore this awakening, I was severely depressed for 5 years, had chemical imbalances associated with depression, severe social anxiety, anger problems, constant panic attacks and suicidal thoughts to the point of attempting it. I was to the point where I couldn\u2019t talk to my parents or any human being. I was that scared. I couldn\u2019t go outside and the suffering was immeasurable. I was a broken being. I was then forced to go to therapy and to keep it short, therapy was taking too long, the doctor wanted to prescribe medication, etc. One day I sat down threw everything away that was of my past, and whatever happened at that moment, I can\u2019t explain it. I didn\u2019t feel motivated or the urge to change, it was just a drive that exceeded any intellectual understanding. I said F\\*\\*\\* chemical imbalances, F\\*\\*\\* medication, F\\*\\*\\* Therapy, F\\*\\*\\* everything and taking 10 years to change, i\u2019m going to F\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* change once and for all and by myself. It was a surge of fire that never rested. I did what I knew best, study. I barely slept and delved deep into the causes of suffering. Hours and I mean hours of endless days and nights went on and long story short I stumbled upon Zen, Buddhism and philosophy. I ultimately ended up reading the power of now which shook my core immensely. Through intense hours of practice of meditation and bare awareness, I got rid of my depression along with all the other extreme emotions I had, including severe social anxiety. A few months after the awakening, I lost it and slowly, I began believing my thoughts and was beating myself up because after years of suffering and finally overcoming what is deemed impossible, \"I\" lost it because as i said before, I couldn\u2019t simply let go. Being one who was always in solitary, this girl was a new experience and I didn\u2019t have the guidance to deal with love if you will. My brother however kept his awareness for months and months after where all those months I lived in a state of pure anger due to my mistakes and couldn't function right. I knew what I knew but knowledge is folly without practice. I built this spiritual ego where I would tell myself be aware, you're not you're thoughts etc.. but didn't truly believe it. My brother kept helping me and lecturing me for 1 more year. I just got worse. He stayed the same. I was so toxic where every day I would get angry and lash out on him because he kept his awareness and bliss while I was suffering in anger and I couldn't snap out of it and so forth. The toxicity was far too much that he wanted to move out and to the point where instead of helping himself, he was helping me which made him ultimately lose his awareness. I tried everything I ever learned to see the light and nothing helped.\n\nEnough was enough and I decided to save up money to quit my job and spend some time with myself. I saved enough to have a few months to be with myself before venturing out to work. This is critical for me. To clarify, this anger is not one that is directed to others. Instead, I have more compassion towards others due to my experience. This anger is in a form of self loathing in where I can\u2019t accept myself for ruining the only beacon of light I had after all the years of suffering. With this, I tend to lash it out on others but am deeply aware that it\u2019s due to my non-acceptance of what I did to ruin my brothers life and mine. I spent the first few weeks researching books and easing into some practices. I managed to compile a list of what people thought were great for them so I want some advice to get back on the path. After doing practices for the first time since my downfall and seeing my mind for the first time in a while, I realize I have an immeasurable amount of negative thoughts that were hidden. I did some research and managed to find several books from zen and Buddhism to non duality and more. I looked at all of them and narrowed it down to a few books listed below. I want one book that'll steer me in the right direction for the next few months where I can develop more clarity, awareness and keep reading so I can grow on this path. This is important for me because it's one of the few times that i'll have time free to work on myself. I am completely aware that the book itself is not going to change me. I just want a kick-start and after falling off the wagon for what would be almost a year, I need to settle back into the midst of spirituality. During my downfall, I have attached many negativity and created concepts and ideas to my practices. I want to start anew and let go of all concepts to begin on a fresh slate. For those wondering, I\u2019m only 21 years old. Now I know many of you can say that if I was able to cultivate awareness and understand the nature of my mind with all those sufferings before then why can\u2019t I do it now? Well, that\u2019s why I\u2019m in dire need of help. I have one huge obstacle that I didn\u2019t have back then: a spiritual ego.\n\nIf you guys have any other advice on how to start this spiritual journey, i would be extremely grateful!\n\nThe books that I narrowed it down to are:\n\n* Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness: Walking the Buddha's Path\n* No Mud, No Lotus: The Art of Transforming Suffering\n* The heart of Buddha's teaching\n* Be as you are\n* The diamond in your pocket\n* Full catastrophe living\n* The way of liberation: a practical guide\n* Falling into grace\n* Awareness: the perils &amp; opportunities of reality\n* Awakening to the natural state\n* You were never born\n* The untethered soul\n\nThe books I have reserved for later when I'm deeper into my path Unless you feel one of these books are best suited for me.\n\n1.

I was young and had been with him since my teen years and wanted to experience the world differently knowing he had shielded my life and made everything comfortable and easy for me.\n\nI wanted to know what I, alone, was made of.\n\nI'll skip over most of the details but the beginning started out VERY difficult. It sent me down the path of self discovery. I sought peace, happiness, healing, self love and release. I'm still on this journey of course... it seems a lifetime worth of work. \n\nI went on a mission seeking a feeling in my body that I could not describe. I could only ever equate it as freedom or the feeling of jumping into a cold pool of water on a hot day. \n\nAs years passed he faded from my life, developing a new life of his own and me developing my own. He always stayed in the back of my mind as my protector and the thought of our love ever having existed gave me peace when I couldn't find any elsewhere. \n\nIt came to the point that I decided I needed to let go. While I felt lost in my own life, I didn't think this had anything to do with him, from a distance he looked like he'd completely figured his out. \n\nAs my life moved forward I found a new relationship. It's never compared but I convinced myself it's fine, I had had my deepest love at a young age and I'm grateful for that. As my relationship progressed and we moved in together, this new man was preparing to propose to me.\n\nI had been thinking of the old HIM more and more and the thoughts became constant. I thought it was just my brain trying to ask me if I was sure of my life choices but then HE popped up in my emails. We haven't spoken in years but I swear he could feel me moving farther away. This was confirmation enough to me that we're mentally and energetically still completely connected.\n\nWe exchanged kindnesses... asked and answered questions.... until I started to feel I needed to go again.\n\n He told me he still loved me. That he'd been missing this feeling he can't figure out and he'd been seeking it for years. Ultimately he landed on me. It was me that was missing.\n\nI never considered this feeling I was seeking was him. And then I agreed to meet with him. Just like that, my insides were glowing. I couldn't stop smiling. I felt at ease like I hadn't in years. I felt safe. I felt like ME with no masks on. I felt FREE. The next day the world looked brighter. The trees were beautiful in a way that made me cry. The sky was wondrous. \n\nThat feeling I'd been seeking... I can feel it beginning to emerge from the shadows.\n\nI understand that this is love. \n\nHERE IS MY QUESTION\n\nThis person is not my twin flame I dont think, a soul mate of sorts but not just a soulmate... is there a lesser known connection or division of souls? \n\nAll I can describe is absolute magic coursing through me.

How could we possible feel it then IF there is some kind of diffrent dimension where we go after dead.\n\nHope I dont get too much hate, I am not really into this things, just getting started but I'm really fascinated by them :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58378, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just curious about...", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569070139, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6ufl6/just_curious_about/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DadaBhagwan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_qpfwq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568983053, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6ual2/stop_finding_faults_of_others_is_the_first_step/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d6ual2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d6ual2/stop_finding_faults_of_others_is_the_first_step/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568983056, "score": 20, "selftext": "Addition and subtraction are both natural adjustments.

Sent it straight to brow, thinking that's pineal. Although Wonderful superconcious experience that night. Big mistake right?\n\nSince then I've been on one hell of a ride with too many good and bad experiences by now. Fried my brain once, had to go completely sober for sanity, Crazy visualizations a few times, depersonalization, almost every night surging energy, learnt grounding, minor Awakenings atleast 20 times (couldn't make it last more than a few seconds, which Is a good thing because I've heard one can get really fucked if it rises and gets stuck).\n This month I made a powerful mental note to not have any awakening experiences until I'm a few years sober and stable and surprisingly not one experience this month. I'm strengthening my grounding and focusing on calmness and equanimity.\nThe energetic channel of my body is still very much active.\n\n1) First of all, Our conciousness is said to lie at the back of our heads as it was for me, but since that night I almost always feel my conciousness on my brow. And Any simple use of minds eye activates the energies at the third eye, and puts my brain on vibration.It only takes a few seconds for energy to reach the head but it takes hours to get it back down completely. Somedays I just give up and let it stay in my head. So you can say my pineal is more active than my pituitary. \nCan I revert this back to normal nature somehow so that my pituitary is the primary gland again?\n\n2) The biggest problem I'm facing rn and very difficult to explain (so bear with me) is that the  my personal energies tend to centre on my mind's eye. And as my third eye is an energetic centre, my visualizations tend to control how I perceive myself and manage myself as well, it's crazzzy mind boggling. Its as if my feelings and my chakra energies are outside of my body and work in well defined patterns (I call this karmic memory). \nSo it's like I'm not living inside my skin but with these karmic memory created as a result of BS beliefs and notions.\n For eg I read somewhere about a right spiritual heart and as such after mind eye efforts, I got centred on the right side of my heart and the following days I was very differentiated between my left and right hemispheres. I still feel a strong difference as I have this energetic blocks on the right side but the left side is alright.Like I am highly depersonalized from my body because of this. \nThese karmic memories prevent me from staying personalized with my body as such I don't know how to stay present in the moment anymore at all. Sometimes I'm driving and at the same time I am totally unaware of what's happening around me cuz I'm way inside my head. And sometimes my eyes and my mind merges to show me crazy stuff. But never have I been able to turn it OFF. I can't think without the third eye activating energy. I can't listen to my gut as it's like way too far from my third eye and my gut has the most karmic memories. I never really feel it(whereas earlier I used to work and live totally out of gut instincts). So what really happens is in trying to be present I end up dissecting my being with the eye and whatever I focus on in my body energizes or the energy will flow by the mental notions I have gathered about the functioning of self. Besides the right spiritual heart, I read that there's a ever flowing soundless region in the gut. In seeking that in  my gut with my mind I ended up having the Kundalini rise many a times (only lasted a few seconds but not everytime it's nice, it is scary AF mostly).\nIs anyone aware if what these karmic imprints that I described really are? I have no idea of any energetic or astral plane\n\nNow I can either make new karmic memories with the correct mental notions(such as visualizations energy flowing outwards in all directions from my chakra centres)\n or I can try making the heart my CEO instead of third eye. I do have an open heart now. Took a Lotta work and probably a few more months to make it subconcious. What do you think I should do here?\n\n But I need to do something because I really need to be present. I am grounded but not present. My awareness and conciousness are not ever going and ever working anymore. They work in breaks. And I'm very absent minded in those breaks. And moreover my mind's eye easily instigates my Kundalini\n\n\n3) The Final most inconvenient problem\nThere is depersonalization to the point of losing the plot of life. I don't know whats life anymore. So many people who could do so much more choose to spend their lives at menial jobs and I am just like them now , even they don't know the plot of life anymore. Like those gloomy sad people who don't know how to enjoy anymore, stuck between black and white, and lost the courage to live in the grey or don't know what's grey anymore. \n  I have lots of insight like this but useless with the recurring dpdr and especially at the biggest expense of losing my inner voice. \nI used to have this Specefic personalised tone to my voice during the mental chatter. Somehow once or twice I heard my mental chatter in that personal reassuring MY voice and then I realised what I lost the most. Mental chatter is just chatter now, earlier it was so much more. My voice doesn't feel my own and one could easily diagnose saying that I am depersonalized from my thoughts. I am thinking but they are not MY Thoughts because they're not in my voice anymore and this has got to me very deep,  I want My voice back again. This has really dipped my self confidence as I can't identify with my own voice. It's not a self assuring voice anymore that used to be assertive. Now It's just noise that you need to stand close to me understand my words.\nI feel this has something to do with my gut and especially since gurus call it the soundless region or the region of Brahma (God of creation) where the vibrations of sound A is felt. My mind couldn't fathom how could I speak with my inner voice esp when I use my head to contemplate my speech. As it couldn't fathom, I lost the inner voice. I want it bad. How to go about this?\n\n\nIt's really frustrating to live with a mind that controls the body whereas it ought to be the other way round. I have been through darkest of nights, suffered a lot, barely enjoyed, and very much unable to shut down the eye and completely relax. \nYou see that night I was just trying to empower myself with the Ajna meditation. I was trying to find an escape from my past traumas. Little did I know those traumas were not really traumatic but just sad.

The name of the philosophy is United Universal Spirituality, it unites the concepts of \"United Universe\", \"United Spirituality\", and \"Universal Spirituality\".\n\nUnited Universal Spirituality is based on God, oneness, truth, equality, and freedom, it's being created as a free service to the universe, which helps it to be free from the controversy that's often involved with the subject of spirituality. Everyone is free to subscribe or not subscribe to United Universal Spirituality, and to subscribe to United Universal Spirituality and any other spiritual philosophy at the same time. I'm thankful for and love all of the wonderful spiritual teachers of the past and the spiritual communities that follow them, at the same time, the valuable spiritual, esoteric truths discussed on my site aren't taught by the various spiritual philosophies throughout the universe that are known by humanity, and many of these belief systems contain inaccuracies that it would be a great help to correct.\n\nI hope you'll enjoy your experience with United Universal Spirituality.\u201d\n\nNote: As stated above, United Universal Spirituality is based on freedom, it's being created as a free service to the universe, everyone is free to subscribe or not subscribe to United Universal Spirituality, and to subscribe to United Universal Spirituality and any other spiritual philosophy at the same time.\n\nNote 2: My purpose is only to help create the greatest possible, most God, oneness, and Truth-aligned reality for all, and to add to the wonderful existing spiritual cultures, not to detract from them. Considering the truly awesome, amazing, excellent, and wonderful wonders that have manifested in the names of the great spiritual teachers of the past such as Buddha and Jesus, it's apparent that there's much to value and appreciate about these noble and powerful spirits and their teachings.\n\nNote 3: We do need God, oneness, and Truth, though the perspective that we don't need new spiritual philosophies or religions is understandable. United Universal Spirituality is created to be a new and free service and product, not a new social system. There are no plans to create any kind of new religious organization, especially considering all of the anti-religious sentiment out there.\n\nUnited Universal Spirituality Symbols:  [https://3c9a41fa-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/jmaf6556/united-universe/United%20Universal%20Spirituality%20Symbols.png?attachauth=ANoY7cr-adc595qMjBjaAi2enGxEZigsbHQcKmE6wgXVKGbBZ9jkkUo9Zwgm-K67oJnslLY48dWFufaC1ZUeWY7VfodrKwiHA4UAsTSGIkjauk2qPm7dhAk9uZeQyqGjhGXcomyT\\_B\\_iZvqRAOGTBeRvK\\_bmZIINUmddd-MFxlMLRsyamb4oMi9FB5sNoTFmTLA0eDw1alVnZJjwhGt8bOr\\_zI8A0RxF5fU3WAc2adI\\_1waEiP0sS-vJxnHNJEaFi56OJT8pkVoBDCxY-uaJD7VC8e3wVjmVQA%3D%3D&amp;attredirects=1](https://3c9a41fa-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/jmaf6556/united-universe/United%20Universal%20Spirituality%20Symbols.png?attachauth=ANoY7cr-adc595qMjBjaAi2enGxEZigsbHQcKmE6wgXVKGbBZ9jkkUo9Zwgm-K67oJnslLY48dWFufaC1ZUeWY7VfodrKwiHA4UAsTSGIkjauk2qPm7dhAk9uZeQyqGjhGXcomyT_B_iZvqRAOGTBeRvK_bmZIINUmddd-MFxlMLRsyamb4oMi9FB5sNoTFmTLA0eDw1alVnZJjwhGt8bOr_zI8A0RxF5fU3WAc2adI_1waEiP0sS-vJxnHNJEaFi56OJT8pkVoBDCxY-uaJD7VC8e3wVjmVQA%3D%3D&amp;attredirects=1) \n\nUnited Universal Spirituality is defined by unifying, universal, definitive spiritual truths that are expressed through several symbols. Symbols are a unifying, universal, objective form of communication, they have the same meaning for everyone no matter what language they speak.\n\nUnited Universal Spirituality is defined by the following spiritual truths as expressed through the following symbols:\n\nA logarithmic spiral:\n\nGod is understood and explained definitively using a logarithmic spiral, God is exactly like the origin of a logarithmic spiral, and life like the spiral:\n\n\\- God is our true Self, Heart, essence, center, and source, just as the origin of a logarithmic spiral is situated at the heart of the spiral\n\n\\- God is the one absolute Truth, just as the origin of a logarithmic spiral is the unchanging singularity at which the spiral ultimately converges\n\n\\- God is transcendent, and life perpetually and exponentially grows towards transcendent God without ever reaching God, just as the origin of a logarithmic spiral represents infinity, and a logarithmic spiral perpetually and exponentially approaches its origin without ever reaching it\n\n\\- God is the Omega and the Alpha, just as the origin of a logarithmic spiral represents both the endpoint and beginning point of the spiral, depending on which direction you consider it to be growing, at once\n\n\\- God is complete peace and infinite love, just as a logarithmic spiral's rotations amplitude decreases towards zero and their frequency increases towards infinity as the spiral approaches its origin. Similarly, God is all-pervasive and almighty, which also correspond to zero amplitude and infinity frequency.\n\n\\-\n\nA completely balanced and infinitely frequently vibrating/spinning UFO/top:\n\nSimilarly, God is represented definitively by a completely balanced and infinitely frequently vibrating/spinning UFO or top. God is complete peace and infinite love, just as a theoretical completely balanced and infinitely frequently vibrating/spinning UFO/top's vibrations'/rotations' amplitude is zero and their frequency is infinity.\n\n\\-\n\nA low amplitude high frequency wave:\n\nSimilarly, God is represented by a wave of zero amplitude and infinity frequency. This type of wave corresponds to the state of bliss, and low amplitude high frequency brainwaves, such as gamma brainwaves, that are more prominent during high and powerful spiritual-mental states.\n\n\\-\n\nThe heart symbol:\n\nTrue, unconditional love is essential to any spiritual philosophy.\n\n\\-\n\nA wave:\n\nYin and yang, receiving and giving, peace and love, female and male, zero amplitude and infinity frequency, are the two fundamental qualities of God, oneness, and Truth.\n\nThe state of God, oneness, and Truth unites and equalizes the two fundamental qualities of yin and yang.\n\nConsciousness is grown and strengthened through a yin-yang rhythm of remembering and forgetting God, oneness, and Truth, expansion and contraction, that corresponds to the return and fall phases of a wave's oscillation, that's like the ebb and flow of ocean waves along the shore, the breathing of lungs, the beating of hearts, and the flapping of wings, that progresses towards equilibrium, and in which each new cycle represents a new and more wondrous generation.\n\nWaves are fundamental to reality, and are oscillations around equilibrium states. Every oscillation has a return (towards equilibrium, away from disequilibrium) phase and a fall (away from equilibrium, towards disequilibrium) phase. The two fundamental qualities of yin and yang are essentially the return and fall phases of a wave's oscillation.\n\nThe equilibrium state corresponds to the higher spiritual planes/bodies, chakras, elements, and regions of the body, while the disequilibrium state corresponds to the lower higher spiritual planes/bodies, chakras, elements, and regions of the body.\n\n\\-\n\nA sphere composed of planes that are organized by lightness:\n\nGod is completely and infinitely light, and Creation is made up of an infinite amount of planes of varying density that are organized by lightness in accordance with the concept of gravitational differentiation, the lighter the plane, the closer to God, more united (uniform), and higher and more powerful (lower in amplitude and higher in frequency) it is. This organization applies to the spiritual planes/bodies, chakras, elements, and regions of the body, which correspond to one another in accordance with the macrocosm-microcosm principle.\n\nAccordingly, the state of heaven is essentially one of centeredness on the higher spiritual planes/bodies, chakras, elements, and regions of the body, while the state of hell is essentially one of disconnection from the higher spiritual planes/bodies, chakras, elements, and regions of the body, and excessive focus on the lower spiritual planes/bodies, chakras, elements, and regions of the body instead.\n\nAdditionally, the planes can be matched with the elements, spirit, light, air, water, and minerals, which constitute the essential elemental requirements for life, compose the structure of the universe with regards to living planetary environments, provide a spiritual explanation of evolution, correspond to the spiritual planes/bodies, chakras, and regions of the body, suggest a definitive meaning to the classical elements, and more.\n\n\\-\n\nA universe united as one circle of free equals whose center is God:\n\nThe state of God and Truth, the supreme, highest and most powerful state, is one of complete and infinite oneness. God is the one true example and source of complete and infinite oneness. Therefore, the essence of an ideal unifying foundation is the one true complete and infinite God at the heart of us all. The ideal socio-politico-economic structure is one circle of free equals whose center is the one true complete and infinite God at the heart of us all and whose members have one objective, the greatest good of all.\n\n(You can read the full explanations of these principles throughout the rest of my site: [https://sites.google.com/site/jmaf6556/united-universe](https://sites.google.com/site/jmaf6556/united-universe))\n\nIn oneness,\n\nJustin", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58356, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A United Universal Spirituality", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569054986, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6ryp7/a_united_universal_spirituality/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Cammykins134", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ae43zrh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568967651, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6ru6m/a_sign_just_happened_to_me/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d6ru6m", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d6ru6m/a_sign_just_happened_to_me/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568967652, "score": 7, "selftext": "I was asking the angels to show me a sign etc that they are there and a sign I have hung up outside my door that says \u201cTake the risk or loose the chance\u201d  the loose the chance part fell off!

Because while my feelings toward my mother and father aren't *obviously* reflective of the way I feel about the Universe at large, considering the fact that I have been throwing mini-tantrums about not getting what I want or even need out of life, there might just be something to this.\n\nIn fact, just days ago on this forum, I vented in a post about karma and manifesting (\"If karma exists, I must be a terrible person\"), because I truly felt as though I could not get *anything* I was working towards or hoping for. So in this post, I thought I'd explore. \n\nWhat are my beliefs about my parents? Well, they sure as hell didn't provide me with what I needed. Instead of filling me up, they dug a hole inside me I've been trying to fill my whole adult life. They were both very young when I was born, just nineteen, and I was unwanted. My mother was impatient and abusive, both physically and emotionally. My father tried to drown me in a lake. When I was nine or so, my mother picked another winner -- an alcoholic. I haven't spoken to any of them in years. Am I still holding onto anger? Absolutely. Do I still cry, as an almost-31 year old woman, that I never got to sit on my dad's lap and feel protected? You betchia. Do I wish my mother helped me get ready for my prom instead of making me cry and ruining my make-up? Uh-huh. \n\nI was often neglected. My mother would leave at night to party; I would wake up in the middle of the night to an empty apartment, searching for her, crying. When you're a little kid, and you wake up to your mom gone, you don't know if she's coming back. You don't know if you're alone now, forever. One time, she forgot something -- came back into the room for a quick second. I remember reaching out my arms to her, gasping out in relief, screaming for \"mom.\" She said \"oh, shut up,\" and left again. I honestly almost want to laugh at this memory. It's all so comically bad. \n\nThe next morning, she'd want to sleep well into the afternoon. I had to make my own breakfast and lunch. I didn't yet know how to read, but I couldn't turn on the TV because it would wake her up, and that would make her angry. If she got angry, I'd get hit. \n\nMy dad, well....he wasn't even around, except for the occasional weekend when he'd dump me at *his* parents' house or trying to drown me. \n\nSo is it possible that I project my feelings about my parents onto the Universe? Possibly. I can't remember if I've always felt this way, but at the very least this week, I've felt resentful towards \"God.\" Why can't good things ever happen for me? Why can't the blessings ever stay? Can't you just give me what I want? *Don't I deserve it yet?* \n\n.........Am I having an epiphany or rambling like a maniac?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58326, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do we project our feelings about our parents onto the Universe?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569039453, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6plw9/do_we_project_our_feelings_about_our_parents_onto/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mayallurbaconburn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2pacmha0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568952136, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6pflq/i_feel_spiritually_disjointed_and_i_dont_know/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d6pflq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d6pflq/i_feel_spiritually_disjointed_and_i_dont_know/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568952138, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve been on a really intense spiritual journey with my twin flame.

Shine light on the darkness of their deeds and accept no more delusion through mens of non-violent civil disobedience. Do not meet them with fear, anger and hate because this will only make them stronger. Hate only breeds more hate.\n\nThe Heart sees no problem because it knows their is no other &amp; so it takes responsibility (the ability to respond) for all that is by responding with love. There is no one to blame but ourselves.\n\nFrom the point of view of the mind - there is a problem it must fix - that is why it evolved - to help us survive in devistating circumstances. It forms in response to vunerablity. A child is defenseless and so when the external world scares and traumatises the child, the child runs inwards away from the painful sensations that it can't deal with. It forms an ego - a defense - a problem solver. A protector. This can happen to a whole species given a global catastrophy, and all signs point to a series of comet impacts- the last of which hit approx 13,000 years ago, which destroyed civilisation almost entirely - the mytical great flood. That intense trauma created an ego that needed to protect each individual animal so much that it had to almost completely ignore the heart in order to survive. In a desolate burning world only the strong survive. Wolves survive. And so the most dangerous of us survived. Our anaestors. \n\nA great forgetting has occured. \n\nThe wolves we became killed everything that threatened us and we became this planets alpha predator. In other words humans had the greatest capacity to fight. Warriors. That hardened our hearts. We have been slowly reconnecting with our forgotren heart since then. But the mind, having been in control for so long, has been given too much leeway... it has lost touch with the heart. If the mind takes control for ages (thousands of years) it begins to believes it alone is in control. It forgot that it only took control to protect the loving heart.\n\nThis mind is the bibical devil - thao shalt not put false gods before me - we have put the mind ahead of the heart. The mind sees other and thinks (another way of saying it creates seperation where their is none - it creates the illusion of seperate things, people &amp; events.) The heart only sees unity and so it's percpective is nothing - no thoughts - \"no-thing\" - that nothing is infused with love - the dazzling dark.\n\nBut we must see the devil isn't evil. From the perspective of unity - the human mind - the devil - is part of a wholistic dualistic system of balance. The Tao. The yin and yang. The balance of opposites. Each requires the other to exist and so to have any pleasure we must have the corresponding pain. This means that one cannot make pain the enemy. Without pain there is no pleasure. Without sorrow there is no joy. That means that without each other there is no life. Evil is live spelt backwards. It's not something that can destroy life, because life is eternal. Evil is any persprctive that doesn't accept all aspects of life. Evil is simply anti-life. So if you are anti-ANYTHING then you have missed the point of life. Love accepts and understands all because love recognises unity. Love knows that only love can heal a broken heart. There is no one to blame. You are life itself. Building and destroying. Eating yourself. Perpetual, cyclical and eternal change. So there is no one to blame. Once one recognises itself - it's own true nature - there are no more problems - acceptance &amp; love become less like things that one tries to do and becomes more like what one IS. Any idea that there is a problem to fix fades away. There is no question of a problem because there isn't even a seperate questioner.\n\nA mind in control for too long would rather create problems than face the pain that it has been created to avoid. It's purpose was to help the individual and species to survive. But once that has been achieved and the society and individul has reached an age of safety, the mind must then let go of control and allow the mature adult and mature society to feel the suffering through opening the heart and allowing that suffering to burst into love. Otherwise the mind will destroy itself, the individual, and the species. The mind must sacrifice itself to heart. Not entirely. Balance must be found. There is always peace in heaven (heart) and so we must reflect that peace on earth (by balancing the opposites in the mind) The eternal shaking hands with the temporal.\n\nAll religions speak of a time when christ / buddha consciousness will bloom in humanity and that time is now.\n\nThe Heart does not fight with the mind because it knows that there is no one to fight with. The Heart feels only peace and unity. So it is the minds sense of alienation from the heart that slowly reveals what the minds greatest desire is: to be at one - to let go of fear and to once again be connected to the whole. At first it believes that in order for this to come to pass, that it must die - which causes intense fear, clinging, attempts to control and resistence to change. So it resists. How can one deal with a mind that wants to live and die simultaniously? That's the world we live in today. Through time dedicated to conscious awareness, the mind comes to see that it is part of the unity and therefore it can never truly die - only change form - and so with that knowledge of the complete freedom and unconditional love that the heart offers, the mind allows the feelings that it previously feared and judged as problematic, bad, or wrong. Death is accepted as a transition, not an ending to be feared. The unrestricted trauma, which are no longer blocked by fear of death and fear of lifes suffering, allows an emotional release of grief, sorrow, regret, blame, fear, anquish. All of these feelings, which are now allowed to be felt free of fear and judgement, transform into love. Tearful, painful, buring, beautiful love.\n\nWith the knowledge and truth of unity the mind reduces it's grasp and slips into the experience of untiy and eternal life. Ego death. Fear is released as it transformed into the feeling of love. The mind sacrifices itself to the heart to reflect back the love and freedom that the heart eternally and unconditionally offers. But nothing ever truly dies - only transformation of consciousnes occurs.\n\nBalance is found for a period before the great cycle of eternity begins to revolve again. Ego returns, but with a reduced role and a more balanced perspective. \n\nWhat we are is simultaniously always changing, yet always the same. Perfect imperfection - Our desire is to live both as apparently seperate, yet as one, and also (most fundamentally) as neither - the wholy trinity -- WHOLENESS. With recognition of wholeness you decide to allow life to be as it is - it's perfect as it is. Attachments fade away and desire eminates from joy rathee than a sense of lack. \n\nIt's all love and so there is no problem once that is truly recognised. If theres no problem then there is no one to fight. Nothing to fix. Nothing that has to be done. Nothing that should be done. Only joyful grateful love.\n\n\u2764\u262f\ufe0f\ud83d\udd49\u2638\u2721\ud83d\udd4b\ud83d\udd4e\ud83d\uded0\u262a\ufe0f\u2626\u271d\ufe0f", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58289, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A coming peace", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569026424, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6n3fy/a_coming_peace/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "reachnout2cyberspace", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_30hgnrxg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568936619, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6meen/please_help/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d6meen", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d6meen/please_help/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568936621, "score": 5, "selftext": "Hi, so I\u2019m currently in Costa Rica (from the US) and it\u2019s my first time out of the country...I\u2019m here because my dad wanted to go and asked me to accompany him.

I don't feel sorry for people who reject wisdom. God only gives so many chances to the lost to turn from their sinful ways.\n\nMy mother recently purchased a show car. It is a 1941 Ford Coupe with a 350 engine, whatever that means. Just a little history, my mother is prone to wrecking cars often. But despite that fact, what does taking actions like these say about the person? We are known by what we do. Our actions define who we are because it says a lot about our motivations. To begin with, my mother is in a lot of debt. Next, what does she want from the show car life? That is a secular life without God. Why would you even want to meet these people? They are the type of people who make large purchases on a whim when they could have used it on more righteous purposes. This means that this new group in which she now belongs to is a group most likely devoid of God.\n\nSometimes I ask people questions already knowing the answer. But I want to see how they will respond. I asked my mother if she had prayed about it and she said she did. But she didn't. Praying about her whim never entered into her mind until I brought it up. And then she saves face and acts like she did when she did not. As soon as she purchases the car she posts it on her Facebook. I replied with a comment stating that what she did was secular. She quickly deleted my comment from her page, even though it was not rude and merely pointed out the truth.\n\nAll of this happened shortly after my mother told me that I am not as smart as I think I am. Why would a mother say that? Why would a mother try to make their kid feel like they are not smart? I then posted to her this book and then she quickly came back and said she did read my stuff and then began to complain about how I described the Jesus as God belief as truly worshipping Satan. She just saw a line that stood out to her and then she complained without understanding nor reading any whole article. She can't trick me. I have statistics for everything. And if I constantly keep catching her in lies like these, then what does that say about her character? What does her purchasing a show car say about her character? We are known by our actions. She constantly complains about how all the kids she trafficked don't like her, are cruel to her, who stick up for their dad and not mom. She does not worship God. She has been tricked and worships Satan. And the results are obvious because it is your character which displays to the world and these actions can easily be assessed for their intention. And when your intention is focused on your ego then its results will reflect that origin.\n\nI am not spreading gossip. I am merely telling you a true story. Satanists in this world don't want you to talk about issues like these publicly. They claim them as private matters. And they assume that because I live in this world that I adhere to their practices, meaning that I would not include such matters in my writings. But why not? These are my experiences and I can do whatever I please with them. Just because X person is involved does not exclude them from inclusion in my work. And they all know that I live a public life. Be careful what you say to someone who lives a public life, for your words might one day be used as an example to demonstrate a point. And if this is the case, it would be wise to choose your words carefully when communicating with me. When you hear someone is an author, remember that they are seeking motivation for their next chapter. If someone's idiocracy allows them to say really stupid things, then they have no one to blame for their actions being exposed but themselves. And we must remember always when dealing with my mother, Ivory Heart, Chapter 17. All of my family have already long ago been reaped. They won't be joining me in heaven. They had their chance and I recorded their results. If they have a problem with my work then that means they have a problem with their own actions. Because all I did was record their actions and then discuss the piety (or lack thereof) of their actions. And to be honest, this method works to create knowledge from scratch. Record data, analyse results. So easy, even a child can do it.\n\nWhat I am doing is a science. I spend my life reflecting on my life reflecting on my life. Do you understand? I contemplate for long periods of time and then let my heart flow into words on a paper when the content is ready. My mind creates many questions and then places those questions in the background only awaiting correct information to understand. Upon understanding, then comes writing. Upon a completed piece of writing comes reflection. It is a cycle. I am constantly recreating my work. I have lost count how many times I have had to restart. An example is that I am required to re-record Ivory Heart because the quality is not up to standard. I hate standardisations. Just because the quality is low does not reduce the quality of the production whatsoever. I should be able to use whatever standard I want. But this Satanic world forces me to abide by their ways inorder to be accepted. The artist loses their autonomy by standardisations. I had to learn how to do things the way they wanted. And I did and now all of my future work is excellent quality as well as quick and easy. I have been doing this for so long that I know how this process works. I am now really good at what I do. For what I now do in my present, I no longer have to repeat. However, there are mistakes from my past that I will be required to rebuild again such as Ivory Heart. But as time goes by, the less and less energy I have to exert to complete my work. I memorised the routine and now mostly act on automatic pilot. But I programmed that automatic pilot so I know exactly how it functions. Open your eyes and see the secrets I am revealing to you. I have a lot of work for you that is packed full of hidden information like this in which those who have eyes to see, panoramically can.\n\nThere are leaders and followers in this world. It is easy to see who leads by their content, for it will be original and not reflect another's. A follower is just passing on a message which was passed on to them. Most people follow because most people have no original thought of their own. Followers are much more dangerous than leaders because they don't understand what they follow, they merely follow. True leaders are those who show others how to be leaders and not followers. For followers oftentimes distort and corrupt the original message, oftentimes dressing it into an egoistic  imitation. The leaders who lead with wisdom will train those who follow to lead utilising their own gifts. For leaders can comprehend why they are doing what they are doing. This world needs less followers and more leaders. But the only way that is going to happen is if leaders seek other leaders and not followers. I don't want any followers. If you are going to follow me, I would prefer you just leave my work alone and go play with Beyonc\u00e9 or something. She is much more suitable for followers. For even she is a reaper and does not know it. For those who follow her will also follow her directly to Hell.\n\nThis world was made for you and your reflections on it. There is no such matter that is considered too personal to include in your work.  You can include anything you like to use as examples for your line of thought. If the information is extremely sensitive, the worst case scenario is that you just have to mask or de-identify the information a little. You are a scientist and this world is your experiment. You make a hypothesis, play out the experiment, write up a conclusion. You don't need a lab, for this world is your laboratory.\n\nAll of your evil unfolds before you. Evil works in a linear fashion. The consequences of our actions will appear before us if we only make note of the factors at play. Evil will trip up on itself leading to more evil to cover itself.\n\n\"Aye, glimpsed the HOUNDS of the Barrier,\nlying in wait for he who would pass them.\nIn that space where time exists not,\nfaintly I sensed the guardians of cycles.\nMove they only through angles.\nFree are they not of the curved dimensions.\"\nThe Emerald Tablets of Thoth, Tablet VIII\n\nDemons can only move in angles, evil only in lines. Tablet VIII continues,\n\n\"Think not to escape by entering your body,\nfor follow they fast the Soul through angles.\nOnly the circle will give ye protection,\nsave from the claws of the DWELLERS IN ANGLES.\"\n\nThis is very deep allegory that has been sitting on my shelf for many years. It took me a very long time to truly comprehend what it was trying to convey. However, from the first time I read it I saw great wisdom in it. I am not suggesting that we draw circles around ourselves to protect ourselves from evil, for such rituals are vain and ineffective. But I am saying in the ways in which you move should be circular. I don't literally mean physically move in circles, although from a martial arts perspective this is valid too. The untrained will move in straight lines and the trained in circles. The pious will move in circles while evil will move in straight lines. Move yourself around a topic, not through it. A circle makes all angles around the tree and as a result the tree becomes more known to us. Whereas working with lines will only introduce you to one side of that tree. Move around the topics and don't allow your words to commit too far in any one direction.\n\nOur physical corporeal bodies naturally think in angles. We move forward, back, side, side. It is our soul that transcends into circles. It is like when someone lies and gets caught out. They have to invent new lies in order to keep the old lie believable. But the truth needs no defence. It is what it is without dressing it in different clothes. The lie trips up on itself whereas the truth stands up to all scrutiny. Ever since I started all of this I have been insulted and mocked countless times. But that is all they can do, for I use logic in my work. There has not been a single person who has been able to debunk a single thing in which I have presented. This is what happens when you build your house upon solid foundations.\n\n\"Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house on a rock. The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it didn't fall, for it was founded on the rock. Everyone who hears these words of mine, and doesn't do them will be like a foolish man, who built his house on the sand. The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell\u2014and great was its fall.\"\nMatthew 7:24-27\n\nEventually we will realise that Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are all the same religion. That will give us over four billion strong. That is over half of our world population. I am pretty sure that we can eradicate the sickness of atheism eventually working with these odds. And then we can get rid of idolatry. Because eventually we will learn the absolute truth about God. God exists and can be tested and eventually found. Science will eventually discover God. God is being hidden from the public currently. Most of government secrets have to do with spiritual forces that were discovered. They want the end of the world to happen as soon as possible. And they reckon if they hide God from the public, mankind will deteriorate to the point that God must intervene. The government has declared war on God and has stepped in as God of the people. As we have already learned, this step-in trick is Satan stepping in for God, being worshipped as God and trying to replace God. Last time we spoke of Jesus. Then Hollywood. This time we speak of the government. We know you by your actions. Bow to none before God. What you do shows us what and/or who you bow to. There is no hiding from God.\n\nDo not trust the prophet who screams over and over, \"believe me, believe me!\" Only trust the prophet who says, \"let me show you.\"\n\nhttp://nesmith.net/atheden", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58243, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Raining Heaven", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569007039, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6iu8x/raining_heaven/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "divine_s0da", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_414jq3u7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568917949, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6i7na/a_cosmic_joke/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d6i7na", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d6i7na/a_cosmic_joke/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568917953, "score": 1, "selftext": "If you haven\u2019t listened to Alan Watts lately, I would highly recommend giving him a try. He would often refer to life as one big cosmic joke. In so many ways, life is not even close to as serious as we make it out to be. This applies to all perspectives: from the one who sees the world as a dark/hostile place, to the one who spends his whole life lost in spiritual pursuits trying to find meaning. We all take life way too seriously, and the reason has to do with a fundamental misunderstanding of who you are.\n\nThe truth is that death is not the end of your life, just as much as you being born was not the beginning. You are experiencing an endless cycle of existences that are likely happening all at once. When you \u201cdie\u201d, it is merely the end of this one fragmented experience. But you won\u2019t necessarily realize it or even miss it. It\u2019s all good, you will just continue to be pure existence/creation in another form. But you can\u2019t see any of that right now.. from your point of view, this body you\u2019re in currently is all there is and ever was. Everything outside of you.. is outside of you.\n\nThe joke is that we don\u2019t get to know/feel this truth in our waking life (at least not so easily). There are ways to see, but until you do, life is going to feel more like a whole big world out there with important events happening, and important people doing important things with their important lives. And so as an individual living in the 21st century modern world, you are just a mere speck. And you compare.. you feel so minuscule that you no longer experience any connection to anything or anyone around you. It\u2019s just you; lost and unsure of what you\u2019re \u201csuppose to\u201d be doing here.\n\nThis is at the core of depression and anxiety. It\u2019s this constant undertone feeling of infinite dread and uncertainty of what is going to happen to you. You feel trapped by the hopelessness of the situation, and it matters. It matters a whole lot to you and everyone around you capable of judging your life against the \u201cshould\u2019s\u201d.\n\nBut none of that is real. You are the entirety of all of existence experiencing fragmentation.. but your true nature is God itself. There are no should\u2019s, you get to do exactly what you want in life. You are the most beautiful and perfect thing that could ever exist, and you get to honor that and everything around you each and every day, because it is all **You**. You still have to play the game that society has created, but know that the game itself is in a state of delusion. It rewards both those who follow the rules and play the game, and those who completely disregard the norms in favor of authentic creative expression. Those who sit in-between suffer a life of mediocrity, victimhood and unfulfillment.\n\nSo go on.. improve your life in all the ways you desire. If you feel lack in how much money you make, the job you go to, your physical health or your relationships, then go and become the very best version of yourself. But do it because you enjoy experiencing just how capable you are, and how awesome that feels.. not because you want to live up to some external ideal and gain external validation (love) from other people. It\u2019s all for you.\n\nAnd take your time.. this is a long ass process. It\u2019s your life\u2019s work. There is no rush or deadline to meet. It will all happen in good time if your intentions and heart are in the right place. Release your addiction to external validation or what people think of you. Because it doesn\u2019t matter.. this is the joke: it **really doesn\u2019t matter**. You yourself are everything you\u2019ve been looking for all along anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*I laugh when I think how I once sought paradise as a realm outside of the world of birth. It is right in the world of birth and death that the miraculous truth is revealed. But this is not the laughter of someone who suddenly acquires a great fortune; neither is it the laughter of one who has won a victory. It is, rather, the laughter of one who; after having painfully searched for something for a long time, finds it one morning in the pocket of his coat.*  \n\\- *Thich Nhat Hanh*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58237, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A cosmic joke", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569004337, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6i7na/a_cosmic_joke/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ChaixD", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_irxns", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568917502, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6i3zj/is_my_ego_the_reason_im_interested_in_my_physical/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d6i3zj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d6i3zj/is_my_ego_the_reason_im_interested_in_my_physical/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568917503, "score": 5, "selftext": "I have always found myself self conscious and insecure of some of my physical aspect.

I am a people person (ENFJ on the MBTI test) and now I am sitting alone in an editing booth, and every now then working with numbers (that I hate).\n\nWirst of all, I bearly have time to just sit for a minute and relax, and I feel like all my spiritual progress is quickly slipping away. I'm afraid if being consumed by this life I never wantsd and forgetting the things I have learned. I love being enlightened and free minded and in control of my own fate, I don't want to become a working zombie like most people, and just be happy that I get money in exchange for all my time...\n\nWhat can I do?? I'm thinking of doing some mushrooms soon, maybe I'll aee a way out. I am talented in many things, especially in the arts and I am a great teacher in spirituallity and life coaching for young people like myself , but I feel like its all going to waste with this job. I value myself and the things I'm good at. I feel like everything I've ever stood for means nothing now because I am confirming to this system of money in exchange for my freedom.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58228, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "HELP!!", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569002334, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6hr0b/help/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ImmortalCell", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3hldprfh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568914723, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6hh2k/showering/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d6hh2k", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d6hh2k/showering/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568914806, "score": 0, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58225, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Showering", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569001106, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6hh2k/showering/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "kaurokauro", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3s441tcn", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568913731, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6h8rw/getting_emotional_when_thinking_about_speaking/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d6h8rw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d6h8rw/getting_emotional_when_thinking_about_speaking/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568913743, "score": 8, "selftext": "Hi!

But by doing so, some important things might be missed. This video is about something special I've learned with the 14th Dalai Lama.\n\nLiving is what we do. Interesting enough, we don't know how to not be alive. Obvious, but with deep consequences. One of them is that we'll not be here forever. By having life, it means that we'll not have it one day. And this lost is only possible because we had it in the first place. One can not lost what we never had.\n\nBut a point needs to be made: are we ready to abandon things when the time comes? Not that a choice is available at the end of the road, but had we truly lived our lives, doing what our hearts and souls asked from us? A personal question, that each individual will have to answer one day.\n\nBy accepting the fact that our time is not limitless, that we are not immortals, we might face life with a completely different perspective, enjoying it and making it a more meaningful overall experience.\n\nAs said in the video, my idea with such thoughts are to spark some reflections, not to see the bad side of things. Happiness and fulfillment are achievable, we only need to seek them. Seek and find.\n\nAnd to complement such idea, a quote by John Lennon (can't remember the exact wording) \"Time you enjoy waste was not wasted\".\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnhOuEn3euI&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnhOuEn3euI&amp;t)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58192, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What I've Learned With Dalai Lama", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568985361, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6dwg8/what_ive_learned_with_dalai_lama/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "dontyouworryangel", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4f0sctkw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568897128, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6dix4/can_you_save_yourself_from_your_own_karma_or_no/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d6dix4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d6dix4/can_you_save_yourself_from_your_own_karma_or_no/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568897130, "score": 3, "selftext": "I've been doing everything right my whole life.

I listened to this subliminal that was supposed to give me supernatural luck earlier this month, and I got 2 classes that I had been wanting to add. When I gave this late add petition to the deen at my college, he asked me \"so how'd you become the lucky one?\" and I was like \"what?\" and then he just laughed and said never mind.. I only listened to that subliminal that week. Anyways, I stopped listening to it for a few reasons. \n\n1. I don't want karma, I don't want to suddenly get bad luck as a result of karma from getting 'supernatural good luck'. I'm scared that may happen.\n2. I don't want to mess with faith, I am scared I may be preventing things which are SUPPOSED to happen to me in life by forcibly giving myself good luck\n3. I don't want to permanently have good luck and just be bored with life because of it. Sometimes challenges (small challenges- not terrible suffering), or occasionally not getting what you want helps you appreciate life when you do overcome challenges and you do get what you want. I'm scared I'll ruin this by giving myself permanent good luck.\n\nAre these concerns valid, and will the good luck from the subliminal become permanent (the video creator said it would be if you listen 3-6 times a month) - by permanent does this mean for the rest of my life, or only for a year or so?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58141, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Listening to Subliminals (Law of Attraction)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568960694, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d6a21y/listening_to_subliminals_law_of_attraction/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "usernamealrdytakn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kaud2l2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568872706, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d69tnl/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_182425/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d69tnl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Enlightenment"}], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d69tnl/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_182425/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "xguP9lAzbWGe3Y6MHnG4Vcbu1Q8zDGEIj_-2SRr2J84", "resolutions": [{"height": 100, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/gOvs8h193lq2DDfUqMkfTc2hU3168qjcjrS-65tnZXI.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82eb679bf1c0d754aad9843ec401523d9a14b134", "width": 108}, {"height": 201, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/gOvs8h193lq2DDfUqMkfTc2hU3168qjcjrS-65tnZXI.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0450e74e38c6670f1c6ef35230655da7666c5ea1", "width": 216}, {"height": 299, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/gOvs8h193lq2DDfUqMkfTc2hU3168qjcjrS-65tnZXI.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0e96c0fa8e010a5c7156cf2135c9c03dba5948f", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 561, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/gOvs8h193lq2DDfUqMkfTc2hU3168qjcjrS-65tnZXI.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d8fdf5b5522e98a3e5effa07b61cbe5e642da18a", "width": 600}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1568872709, "score": 4, "selftext": "**TRANSLATION**\n\n**18.24.But action performed with great effort by one seeking to gratify his desires, and which is enacted from a sense of false ego, is called action in the mode of passion.**\n\n**18.25.And that action performed in ignorance and delusion without consideration of future bondage or consequences, which inflicts injury and is impractical, is said to be action in the mode of ignorance.**\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nhas to give account of one's actions to the state or to the agents of the Supreme Lord called the Yamad\u016btas.

And receive/listen to the best true word of love, guidance, reason and truth. \n\nOur philosophy was to accept everyone as a vessel for a growing soul, who\u2019s journey and destination was the same as ours. \n\nOur motivation was to bare fruit for each other and ourselves in many ways and techniques that is needed for us to continue happily. (Meaning we all offer our best, and supply a range of things that is needed varrying from entertainments, traditions, philosophies, preparations and plans for future, ideas, supplies and foods, etc) pretty much a diversity of things needed by a lot of different people. We would supply that. \n\nWe can take arm ourselves with important  teachings of wisdom and insight/intentions to arm and better ourselves allowing us to grow into nurturing beings that allows for us to do more. \n\nWe calm our minds and learn to reason and be constructive. Rather than just be ignorant angry and throw people into prisons. People commit crimes because they have nowhere to turn, or do not know how to solve a problem. Or don\u2019t have anyone to solve the issue for them. Souls that are strong and healed or intact do not find the need to commit crimes. Unless they faulted in their own weakness. \n\nOur goal would be to first divide and distribute all basic necessities first to all those in need. We would do the most effective and efficient action in order to supply the needs of others whiles thinking of the course of our future. \n\nOnce basic necessities like food and water are going out. We would should find ways to heal the land again. Stop global warming. And aid the impoverished nations into becoming nations that are moving on their feet. \n\nDuring this time there\u2019s a whole lot of things and activity going on world wide with daily work and affairs. But if we honestly want to do what\u2019s good. This is the better path. But things won\u2019t go word by word according to this of course. This is just the basic fundamentals and ideas to actually recovering and healing our people and planet along with it. \n\nOnce our people are healthy we should focus on advancing medically and technologically. We absolutely need to keep a healthy balance between nature and cities or else our earth will lose its beauty and we will lose resources. We know concrete over all the land will kill us. So we need to make a balance and be aware of the space we use and what we use it for. \n\nAs a person with their needs being taken care of. It\u2019s hard to complain and cause harm anymore. Because there\u2019s no use and it\u2019s very uneeded. So if we supply the needs to others. I feel naturally violence and disturbances will die down. That\u2019s a good thing. \n\nWe are in an ever expanding universe. That\u2019s been around for a long time now.. very very very long. Billions and billions of years or more. Who knows a trillion or more maybe. Space expands fast. There are 10 planets in our solar system. Stars, galaxy\u2019s, comets, planets. Cool stuff for sure. If we don\u2019t want to use our land more responsibly, or keep on increasing in numbers. We will have to have those people be somewhere. \n\nSo colonizing another planet is an option. \n\nBut personally I would say hold on until we can locate or find another earth too. Cus lets be real. Who\u2019s gonna want to live on a planet without life on it. That\u2019s depressing. \n\nIn all. This is the fundamentals of this message to you. That you should consider. \n\n- Treat and care for others as your equal. \n- Think and prepare for the future \n- Be responsible and offer your talents and skills to make life pleasure ful and fruitful\n- Be loving and not selfish\n- Guide one another accordingly and help whenever you can with your thoughts perspectives and ideas\n- Do what makes you happy within boundaries and reason. \n\n\n\nThese are some things I would think of. I know for a fact it would be helpful. From here on it\u2019s just up to you and your values and experience to judge wether you agree and like it or not.\n\nLeaders are absolutely necessary in order to run or operate with such numbers of people. Especially living the way we do. But without and preparations for the future I mean cumon. You\u2019d pretty much get to exactly where we are now. A planet with a death sentence. \n\nThis here is a solution. It doesn\u2019t matter who wrote this.

Seeing energy.\n\ni'v been feeling energies my whole life but recently it's gotten out of hand. normally i see energy as colors but about a month ago i started to see those colors take shape and form. From monster's to human looking silhouettes to pure emotions as creatures. Not like living things but the form of creatures. i have horrible depression and crippling anxiety and i can see them and all the other mental issues (not crazy just crippling forms of depression and anxiety that i find hard to describe) as people or things. Depression which i call the lady of the thorns is beautiful but has thorns all around her, i see it like that because when i get into such a deep state of depression i find it hard to move at all, like the panic feeling you get if you've ever been stuck in a thorn bush, beautiful because of the feeling of lust i get for feeling the warmth of that sadness (if you know you know, im not getting into that here}.  anxiety takes many forms from monsters to fires to dogs even (idfk) and i never talk about this stuff to anyone because they all think i'm high, joking or crazy. Lately energy has been effecting me differently, it effects my emotions in ways it's never done before. a crimson aura of rage surrounds me, or a foggy gray that consumes everything around me (Depression) to a rainbow of colors some i'v never even seen before, swirling around like electricity in my head from anxiety.  \n\n\n2.Feeling energy/Innerstanding \n\ni'm starting to feel peoples auras stronger than ever to the point where it can cause me to feel things about it. one of my friends is dating this guy who to me is obviously going to break her heart, now before you say \"oh thats just teenage things\" I have been right about EVERY single person for the last 2 years. other friends girlfriends/boyfriends, friendships. you name it, i can feel-understand it. Also i'm an empath, like crazy. i feel peoples emotions just from seeing their eyes or i can tell what type of person they are and 9 times out of 10 are right just based off of the first feeling i get from them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Gazing into the future/foresight.\n\nas a way to cope with my anxiety i run simulations in my head to see the most likely outcome of a situation but recently it's been getting insanely accurate, to the point where a few days ago it happened and i almost threw up because of how accurate it was. Another thing, Gazing. seeing the future. it used to only happen in my dreams, it would happen as a kid and i thought it was just a cool coincidence but now the length of the part of the future i see is getting longer and longer. as a child it was just an image, now it's minutes of time. and i dont just see glimpses in my dreams either now, i can \"control\" it. i can trigger it to happen but it's always random things so i try to stay away from it in case i see something i shouldn't (you never know). Today it got horribly realistic. i saw the date of the glimpse in my head. i dont want to talk about what i saw but the date was September 27th 2019. next friday. i am horrified to see if it happens but if it does than i dont know what im going to do (nothing bad happened in the glimpse it's just that my body feels horrible when i live what i saw and in this glimpse i felt smelt and heard everything, something that has never happened before) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Pure foresight.\n\na couple of days ago my energy started going insane, i mean my stomach was ripping itself apart, i got dizzy as hell and my vision acted up.

Stomach dropped and everything felt heavy but fluid like water at the same time. i learned about some heavy shit that happened to her. i'm putting her ahead of everything else because what happened was fucked (what you thought it was, was probably the right answer) stuff like this has happened before but never to this point. my ability of feeling things is growing more and more and i don't know how to deal with it, im terrified.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58126, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Spiritual vent, need help with my journey.

There are issues of which many of you are completely unaware, and they are areas of great concern if the civilization is to move forward in Love and Light. The issue we speak of is the secret government - the covert operations which have been conducted by the group you have called the Illuminati. We prefer to call them the Dark Hats because there is nothing of Light about them. Some of you know their origins and history, but we will give you a brief description here.\n\nThe ones you know as the Fallen Angels, led by Lucifer, were not evil, but were rebellious against the idea that all beings should be connected with God. They wished to try complete independence, to live without having to rely on the I AM Presence in their lives. They were what you might call the original atheists, but they were well aware of the God they were rebelling against, since they were our own dear children. They came to Earth during a period of upheaval, and taught their beliefs to others.\n\nAmong those others were the Reptilians, a race of beings also created by us, who were exceptional for their intense passion and creativity. They were a part of the racial mixing which was to become you, the humans of Planet Earth, known as The Creator Race.\n\nThe strengths of the Reptilians was in their high levels of intuition, perceptiveness and psychic powers. They were intensely loving, fiercely loyal, and gifted intellectually. They were also fiercely independent, and their encounters with Lucifer led to disastrous ends.\n\nSome of the Reptilians, though not all, decided that they would free themselves from their connection to God and to the intensity of their passionate feelings by experimenting with their own DNA. Tragically, they used their scientific abilities to remake themselves into a race without the connection to their hearts which allows all beings to feel Love for one another and for their God. Incidentally, their philosophy - that love is to be avoided because it will lead to pain, and that sensitivity is weakness - has become a mantra in your own cultures to this day.\n\nOnce freed from the requirement of Love and its corollary feelings of compassion, forgiveness, empathy, nurturance and reverence for life, they became the source of evil which went far beyond the intention or control of Lucifer and his followers. It was the Reptilians who took the idea of independence from God to its opposite extreme, and as we have described in Kathryn\u2019s book, the behavior which results is what is now called psychopathic or sociopathic. They became intelligent beings without Heart - an extremely dangerous combination.\n\nIt would not have been possible for them to maintain their practice of evil in every area of life on Earth if they had taken part in the after-life process which everyone else experiences. As we have described to you earlier, at the end of every life, all God\u2019s children ascend to the 5th dimension to be welcomed back to the dimensions of Unending Love, and to review, with the help of your Guides and mentors, the entire experience of your life. As you re-experience your actions which caused others pain from their point of view, you are taught in the most profound way to feel empathy for others and forgiveness for yourself, as you experience Our forgiveness and compassion.\n\nIn order to avoid any learning or contact with Us, the Reptilians devised a plan to remain in the 4th dimension, close to the Earth plane, where they could recycle quickly into the same families, maintaining the human bloodline true to its Reptilian ideal of heartless intelligence. This way, they were able to gain great power and control, and their influence has been felt in every area of life.\n\nTheirs was the idea of maintaining the use of fossil fuels rather than permitting free energy discoveries to be given to the people. Theirs also are the manufacturing processes which pollute rivers and steams, killing wildlife in the name of profit, as well as the use of spraying chemicals in the skies to control the population. Any excuses which encourage the misuse or overuse of the precious resources which Mother Earth has so abundantly provided, and every idea which promotes \u201cthe economy\u201d over the wellbeing of the population as a whole has its roots in the Reptilian project. The idea that \u201cthe economy\u201d based on money must be fueled by consumers was a clever ruse for funneling ever more of it into their own secret projects and private purses.\n\nIt is now coming to and end because the 4th dimension has been collapsed to eliminate any refuge from the afterlife review process in God\u2019s higher realms of Love. It cannot continue beyond the lifetime of the beings which are alive today on the planet. The top tier of Reptilian leaders have already been removed and taken for trial and/or restoration to wholeness in Our image, and their lieutenants are now being removed as well, however, some smaller parts of their high level secret programs have been maintained by moving them frequently and by playing a clever cat-and-mouse game with those whose work it is to capture and expose them.\n\nThe work of rounding up the remaining minions is now in the hands of those brave investigators in organizations such as your own CIA, which has been frequently infiltrated and shadowed by a parallel organization of \u201cBlack ops\u201d Dark Hat operatives. During periods in which Dark Hats were in charge of the highest levels of the U.S. Government, such as the Nixon, Reagan and Bush years and the later Clinton administration, there was little separation between the official government organization and the Dark Hat underworld. That is now being dismantled day by day, and more arrests will be made around the world as the truth is revealed.\n\nYou are aware of the current upsurge of the Arab Spring which has brought 30 million people into the streets in Egypt to demand genuinely democratic government. Never before in the history of the world has such massive participation by the people been so\n\norganized and effective in presenting its message to the world. This is the beginning of a worldwide uplifting of consciousness; no nation will be able to remain secretly oppressive of its people behind barriers of silence. Independent media sources - private citizens with cell phone cameras - have made secrecy a thing of the past, and the effects are being felt in every country of the world at once.\n\nWe have given you this overview to help you understand the political and practical implications as well. While things are moving fast, and change is inevitable, there are still some dangers to our Lightworkers. The zealous underlings we mentioned still have possession of some technological tools which can be used to disable or handicap those who are dedicated to service in the name of God. They are targets of various forms of etheric and material implants which can be used to interfere with brain and heart connections.\n\nThose Lightworkers who are involved with Dark Entity removals or who have had contact with \u201cBlack ops\u201d individuals are especially at risk because of their high visibility and their effectiveness in reducing the power of the Dark Ones. Of course, this is not a new phenomenon; it has always been the case in the struggle between good and evil.\n\nWe are working with the Arcturians, with Sananda, Archangels Michael, Gabrielle and others to restore our Beloved Ones to full health, but it is a challenge for the Lightworkers themselves, who must do the internal work of tracking down and dismantling the foreign objects, with our help. The intricate structure of these \u201cimplants\u201d requires that the victim themselves take the lead in the removal of it. It also requires a high level of self-awareness to identify immediately the presence of feelings and attitudes which are \u201cnot me\u201d so that the invading object can be dealt with.\n\nThis is yet another reason to develop your self-awareness and not be swayed by the traditional belief systems which encourage illness and an attitude of submission to medical experts, who of course have no knowledge of etheric implants, but who would be happy to medicate you so that you will be less aware of external interference with your normal functioning. Turn to Us as your first line of defense.\n\nWe do not wish to create fear of Dark Energy or implants by giving you this information. Please read carefully - we are encouraging self-awareness, not fear. Fear is always an invitation for Darkness of all kinds, within and without, so do not permit anxiety or any feelings of victimization. Turn instead to consult with your Angels, and to get help from Us if it is needed for any reason. We are here for your support, comfort and healing.\n\nThings are indeed shifting quickly. It is a time of great celebration and hope. Continue to communicate with Us in your I AM meditations, in your prayers and in every moment of your daily lives. We love you more than words can ever describe; turn instead to the feelings of your heart, where we speak to you of Love.\n\nWith Healing Masters and Angels standing by in willing service to you, We are your ***Mother/Father God.***\n\nVia *Kathryn May*, July 5, 2013, 1 am.\n\n\\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n\\~\\~Mother God Tells of the Reptilians Who Lived Among and Within Us\\~\\~\n\nIt is very difficult for us to speak of the dissolution of the Reptilians who did not agree to come to the Light, to come back Home to us.\n\nThey were our children, all, and we loved them with all our hearts. It is a very sad time for us. We are in deep mourning as a result of their decision to be returned to Source rather than being restored to the loving, creative beings they were born to be.\n\nThe Reptilian race was an ancient creation, born in the Orion star system long ago. They are powerful beings in their ability to feel deeply, as we do. Their qualities are indeed an important part of your human make-up; there has been some combining of your genetic qualities.\n\nMany of those who refused to be restored to wholeness, to have their DNA reactivated and restored to the state they were intended to be when they were first created, were the original children of Orion. They were ancient souls, by your standards, the children of our hearts.\n\nI am Mother God, and I gave birth to these Ones, just as I gave birth to all of you, my precious children. It was our greatest hope that you, our powerful Creator Race, would be able to not only defeat the Reptilians in your midst, but to also show them the way to the Light. You did succeed in preserving many of those who tried to take you over, to inhabit your bodies.\n\nMany of you who came to this life with the burden of carrying a Reptilian entity within your bodies did so as a great sacrifice. It was you who were able to provide the atmosphere of Love and Light which worked on them, little by little. As you were able to sustain yourselves in spite of their dark and destructive actions, your influence on them was felt. Gradually, as the energies rose on the planet and you became stronger and more able to withstand their interference in your thinking and actions, they began to change. Your strength literally flowed through their beings, because they were attached to you in a symbiotic way that caused them to feel what you felt, and it worked to begin the process of reactivating their original DNA.\n\nAnd so, many of the Reptilian children who had been lost to us were returned in the historic ceremony in which 999,000 passed through the gateway which Gabriella and Lucifer created to receive them. It was a moment of great joy and great pain for us. Of course we had hoped to save them all. Your great work during this lifetime made this possible. We will explain to you what your part was, and how you became the rescuers for these ones, your brothers and sisters who had gone to the Dark.\n\nThis last effort to rescue as many as possible was agreed to in our Councils with you and with Prime Creator long ago. It was a complex plan, because it involved a two-fold effort. The Reptilians had to be convinced that their most powerful intervention would be to directly inhabit the bodies of humankind, rather than use their influence to bribe, threaten, manipulate and generally gain influence over you by violent means, externally applied. You are familiar with their assassinations and torture skills. They had been able to infiltrate governments around the world with their mind-control techniques and what you call black-ops systems to an enormous degree.\n\nAs you know, the systems of banking and finance had been completely corrupted by their philosophy of greed and self-interest, which was promoted as \"freedom of the individual\" and defined as honorable self-reliance and independence. It was in fact, the evil agenda in fancy dress. Their power had spread through secret societies and closely-controlled interbreeding within the powerful families who maintained their hold on their power by any means available to them; their preferred methods were torture and assassination.\n\nOur dear St. Germain incarnated over a long period to try to dilute their influence and to lay the groundwork for the events which are evolving now. He established the society which began as the Freemasons. It was a powerful force for good in its early years, including many of the Founding Fathers who worked to establish democracy in America. Unfortunately, it was eventually co-opted by the ones you call Illuminati. We do not use this term because it implies Light; we prefer to refer to them as the Dark Hats. You are also familiar with another of their Dark organizations called the Mafia, or Cosa Nostra, which infiltrated businesses and political organizations across the globe from the ground up.\n\nTheir power had spread to such a degree that it looked as if the entire political system in the U.S. and across the Western World was at the point of entirely succumbing to their influence, and the East was falling into their grasp through financial maneuvering and the influence of multinational corporations. Something had to be done to not only rescue the planet from their grip, but to also make one last attempt to rescue those of the Reptilians who would agree to leave the evil power structure and come to the Light.\n\nAnd so our plan was agreed to, to make one last effort as Mother Earth fulfilled her own destiny to ascend to higher dimensions.\n\nIt was then determined that the only way to stop the march of the Reptilians to take over the world would be to convince them that there was a brilliant means of conquering those Lightworkers who had directly opposed them for generations. That would be to infiltrate their ranks by inhabiting their bodies in large numbers and thereby weaken the ones who were their greatest threat. It was a technique they had used in the past, but never enmass. It remained to convince the Reptilian leaders that this was the reason they had not yet completely succeeded.\n\nAnd so it was decided that the idea would be implanted in the minds of the most powerful Reptilians, and representatives of the Light would be sent in disguise to promote the plan. This was a complex operation in itself, which will all be revealed to you when you raise your consciousness to higher dimensions where you can study the historical records of all the history of your planet and the Cosmos as well. For now, you can compare it to the cloak and dagger action movies you are so fond of, and know it was even more complex and intricate than The Matrix.\n\nEventually it was successful, and the Reptilian leaders began assigning their minions to inhabit the bodies of incarnating humans. The great wave of Reptilian inhabitation began after the turn of the 20th Century, and steadily increased until August 22, 2013, at which time every last one of the Reptilians were removed from the planet.\n\nThe Reptilian invasion of human bodies was a success, but not for the Reptilians. It caused an awakening in those who were experiencing the emotions and thought processes of the human they inhabited. You see, it did have the effect we predicted. Our Earth Children were far stronger, far more resolute and solid than the ones who had redesigned their genetic program. They thought that by removing their capacity to love and to care, they would be stronger. They were completely wrong. It is the wondrous ability to love which is the great strength of humankind.\n\nIt was astonishing to the Reptilians who were trying to \"possess\" their human hosts that they could not defeat you. They certainly tried. It was a battle for the souls, the hearts and minds of both the host and the invader. The wondrous thing was that neither was aware of this. From the human point of view, it was a struggle to maintain balance, to keep going in spite of illness, fatigue, deep feelings of malaise, anxiety, and even despair. For the Reptilian, it was a battle they had never expected - the gradual awakening of feelings they had great disdain for.\n\nThe great irony of this process was that the Reptilians found themselves in a place in their own culture which is similar to the discomfort many of you feel because of your greater sensitivity, your greater awareness of the feelings of those around you and your dedication to doing good work in service to others. You are exceptional in your hard- nosed, competitive and extremely superficial culture - that culture which has been founded predominantly on Reptilian attitudes and beliefs. And so, like you, they found themselves unable to tell their friends and family about the stirrings of their hearts.\n\nNow it is time for the unfolding of a new way of thinking, a new way of organizing your lives. Those among you who are the planners, the organizers and the designers will flourish. Your skills will be needed in so many ways, as you work together to establish your new structures to care and guide your more evolved ways of living. Teachers will be able to teach what they love, and testing and grading will be a thing of the past.\n\nChildren will learn the Socratic method from birth on, and the free exchange of information will excite and elevate all curious minds.\n\nThe gardeners and farmers will find new ways to enjoy the creation of glorious landscapes, without the arduous toil you are used to. Inventors and scientists will have a field day working on new technologies to make life gloriously comfortable and fulfilling. Mathematicians, physicists and astronomers will find their minds expanding to take in astonishing new concepts, where even the sky is not the limit.\n\nIt is possible, Beloved Ones, to live at peace with each other and with your dear Mother Earth. You will return to the Eden of old, and you will find yourselves wiser, more loving and stronger than ever before. Most of the troublesome feelings and conflicts you experienced in the past will fade, as greater and greater numbers of you begin to discover your true nature as the Creator Race. It will be a great relief and pleasure to you to learn how easy it is to be light-hearted, once the grinding Darkness is removed from your daily lives.\n\nYou are approaching your Graduation Day. We have called it Ascension, but it is truly a graduation from the old 3-dimensional life you have known to a wondrously Light and Loving experience unlike anything you have known in this incarnation. There is a lovely September Song with the words, \"Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few, September, November...And these few precious days I'll spend with you, these precious days I'll spend with you...\"\n\nEnjoy your days, Dear Ones. It is your preparation for what is ahead, Your ***Mother God***\n\nVia K*athryn E. May*, August 29, 2013, 12 PM.

I always thought that if I were to be self-employed, my life would bring me more fulfillment. \n\nTurns out, that's not true. While I'd take my new self-employed life over my old having-a-boss life any day, most of my old problems have been replaced by new ones. I'm usually balancing several clients, and at least one of them at a time is a nightmare, making life stressful and even hellish. Always chasing my next paycheck because the next one isn't guaranteed if I don't hustle. \n\nMore importantly, I'm doing something I just don't care about. \n\nThe things I do care about are better fit as hobbies than professions. Writing. Music. Helping the homeless. Activism. My first job was a writing job for a non-profit; all it did for me was make me hate writing for a number of years. Someone's \"editing\" of my work, taking all creativity out of it. \n\nI know this sounds lazy, but I hate having to work, rather than just do things that make my heart happy. I fear that I may never find fulfillment if I have to spend the rest of my life doing something I don't want to do to keep a roof over my head. \n\nMy soul is telling me that the answer is to surrender. The solution will appear when I do. Because that's just how energy works; it doesn't flow when we are constantly fighting against flow. \"Surrender\" and \"let go\" have always been very difficult concepts for me. It feels like a dichotomy to surrender when you're only doing it because you're hoping it'll be the catalyst for change. I suppose true surrender would be the acceptance of your life as-is. And that doesn't feel right either, when you're unhappy. What is surrender? Is surrender being okay with the bag of shit that is your life? How can that be right? How can things get better if you're not working for them to get better? \n\nThank you to anyone that read my ramble on this sad day.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 58045, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm not fulfilled and I don't know what to do about it", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568919908, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d62i10/im_not_fulfilled_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do_about/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "knowing222", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kgk46ln", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568833042, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d62dop/why_is_it_the_default_for_our_brains_to_self/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d62dop", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d62dop/why_is_it_the_default_for_our_brains_to_self/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568833043, "score": 39, "selftext": "Why do we have to work to make peace with our minds?

After trauma, some of it self induced from self destructive tendencies, I felt it harder to cope with reality and started smoking a tremendous amount. Since then, having cut back substantially, I have decided I would like to stop casually smoking and possibly quit entirely. \nAbout the same time this is happening I met someone special who has very similar goals but much stronger will power than I. He\u2019s taught me a lot about the law of attraction and manifestation. \nThe first time I dropped acid was when I was with him after he educated me extensively on it and made sure I felt safe. We decided I would micro dose but I wound up taking a full tab anyway fully intending on getting the full experience. The reason I was so comfortable doing so was because I have a very small friend circle, and they all drop and have been trying to convince me to as well knowing it would most likely improve my mental state and wanting to help. After this first experience I have dropped several more times and have had one bad trip ( one bad experience will never stop me from experiencing the good ones) \nThe reason the LSD is significant is because our \u201creality\u201d starts to seem less real. Not less significant or less important but certainly not as it is. \n\nI\u2019ve always been more of a spiritual person because I\u2019ve found too many flaws and holes in religion, even in those other than my own original Roman Catholic faith. After the experience with LSD I believe I have become \u201cawaken\u201d in the sense that I understand a bit more of the bigger picture and have become \u201cself aware\u201d as well as experienced an ego death. I realized the details of my life don\u2019t really matter for instance, my career or what I achieve materially. What matters is what I learn along the way, who I meet along the way, how much I love and how I react. And most importantly, appreciating. \nWhat I am ultimately struggling with now, is myself. I need help controlling my emotions, managing my depression because when I get into a low I feel as though it sets me back on all this progress I\u2019ve made. Losing motivation and \u201cgiving up\u201d is major issue I struggle with daily.At the moment I am trying to figure out how to raise my vibrational frequencies and learn more about the ability to manifest.

Even thinking about it now challenges my own beliefs.\n\nWhen I was a kid I was SCARED of Jesus. My uncles, who are traditional Mexicans, had a framed painting of Jesus in their apartment. If I ever had to go to the bathroom down the hall I would run and look down because Jesus's eyes always looked at me. I eventually found myself avoiding looking at anything Jesus hoping that I wouldn't be stared at. My dad was actually really bothered by this and told me once that he thought something was wrong with me in a religious sense.\n\nAnyways, I think I must have been no older than 7 when I had a dream of a bright light coming from the kitchen that I could see from my room. I walked into the Kitchen and there was Jesus. I walked up to him and he took my hand put his other hand on my head. I remember getting on one knee when he did this. He looked at me and said. You don't need to be scared of my painting. \n\nI immediately woke up and guess what. I was never scared of that painting or any painting again. In fact It was like I walked through the rest of my life like I never was scared to begin with.  \n\nI have to say before ending that I was the first Christian in my family for quite a few years before the churches views came in conflict with my sexuality.

If you could take the time to read my story and share your insight it would greatly appreciated. I will try to keep it as short as I can.\n\n**\\[My Life Story\\]**\n\nI grew up in the US - in an agnostic, liberal environment in the suburbs.\n\nI grew up with a mentally toxic, unloving father, a loving mother (thank God) , and three brothers (two older brothers and one younger brother).\n\nI grew up very introverted and insecure. I was your classic \"nice guy\" who followed all of the rules.\n\nI fell in love with \"the perfect girl\" in high school and dated her through my first year in community college. At the time I wanted to pursue a career in the film industry.\n\nMy oldest brother committed suicide (about 3 years ago) after struggling with heroin addiction fo several years. I was the one to find him and developed a mild PTSD. He was the only loving, fatherly figure I had while growing up because he was much older than me (about 7 years older). \n\nA year after his passing I caught my high school girlfriend cheating on me while at a music festival and chose to leave her - which was very hard.\n\nI became very depressed and lost after all of the heartache. For a long time I thought of suicide and decided it wasn't an option because I didn't want to put my family through the same pain again. \n\nI was addicted to porn and aspired to become a pick-up artist to fill the void/insecurity I felt. I settled with my associates degree and travelled Europe with my brother for a few months with this mindset and attempted to pick up women - luckily I failed.\n\nI returned home after spending all the money I owned. I was very lost and confused why my trip wasn't fulfilling. I spent the next month or so doing absolutely nothing, smoking pot with my little brother and thinking about life.\n\nAfter some time I stumbled upon some random conspiracy YouTube videos out of boredom. I was never interested in conspiracies before - I always thought they were for \"stupid, right-winged people.\" I found a few very interesting and wanted to learn more - get my own take on it... not trust random information people provide.\n\nThis started me down the rabbit hole of researching a bunch of major conspiracies and researching topics on artificial intelligence. I slowly compiled evidence on 911, the simulation theory, as well as other random theories.\n\nI obsessed for months on my research (due to the free-time I had) and many times felt like I was going insane the more credible information I found. Had a few panic attacks. My dad threatened to send me to a mental hospital after I attempted to show my parents the binder of evidence I compiled. Thank God he didn't.\n\nAnd eventually I started researching into spirituality, the pineal gland, gregg Braden, the law of attraction, the Dead Sea scrolls, and the bible and how well everything connected to all of my other prior research.\n\nWhen the evidence became overwhelming I found this quote from Gregg Braden's research in the Dead Sea scrolls: \"feel as if your prayers are already answered.\"\n\nI found this very interesting because I didn't like the beggar-approach to prayer that traditional Christians practice...I sat down in my room with the intent of practicing this technique and I felt the greatest bliss I have *never* felt in my life. I chose to accept Jesus Christ into my life afterwards and went to sleep... (I later found out that it was the *7th* day of January (this year) that this event occurred in my life...\ud83d\ude42)\n\n**\\[Today\\]**\n\nI have grown immensely since my spiritual awakening. However, I am living with a great deal of obstacles:\n\nI am still living with my family. My toxic father, my mother, and my two brothers. \n\nMy father and mother can be extremely difficult/stressful to be around. Everyday they drink and argue. My dad has a serious drinking problem and is in denial of having a problem. He has also gotten worse since my brother's passing. Everyday he starts drinking around 3PM and watches this horrible real- crime TV show; about real murder cases. Two times he has threatened to physically hurt/kill me when I have confronted him about his behavior. The last time (and worst) time he threatened me was when he randomly came at me from behind with a power drill. He luckily didn't harm me but charged at me in a rage. After this event my brothers and I had dozens of conversations with my mom. She has done absolutely nothing and I don't expect she will ever leave him.\n\nNow I just avoid my father whenever I can. He has slightly improved (now that we have a puppy he likes) and I haven't been threatened in several months. I have considered leaving however I have no money...\n\nIn addition I have horrible upper back pain - which is a whole story in itself. I was told it is the result of trauma, grief and stress. This back pain is extremely limiting and I have tried tons of different doctors, physical therapies and other practices. My father constantly attempts to pick fights with me over the fact I don't have a job due to my back pain.\n\nI am attempting to build a Youtube music and mindfulness channel with my brother for long-term passive income. However, my back always hurts after working on the computer and I can't comfortably work for long. It takes a great deal of yoga and qi gong to make the pain go away.\n\nI am considering Ayahuasca. Someone told me the medicine healed their back due to a huge release in underlying stress and emotions. However, many also say it is dangerous and involved with the occult... idk what to think about it.\n\nI also feel like I am having some sort of ego-death or ego-conflict and I don't know how to explain it to my family - or function around them. Everyday it is becoming easier to identify with the pure awareness that I am (and everyone else is) and my old identity feels like it is fading away - becoming less important. \n\nMy ego (old identity) has ambitions to grow and has ideas of what life should be like, but then another part of me just doesn't care... And then I remember I have to care a little if I want to survive in this financially-driven world. \n\nI also know my family sees me as my old identity and I am afraid to completely let it go because I don't wan't to frighten them with a drastic change. It feels more and more like I am acting as a character in a play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my story and for your insight.

Rather it is insurances, medical care, or pharmaceutical companies (don't even get me started on these...) they don't really seem to have the individual's health in mind because once individuals are truly healthy, they wouldn't profit (except for maybe insurance companies?).   \n\n\nThis discussion is inspired by my best friend. He has suffered many trials in this lifetime (childhood abuse, depression, losing his father, struggles with sexuality, and A LOT of health problems). Instead of the health care field truly trying to get to the bottom of his issues, they pump him up with pills and even say he is more \"likely\" to be addicted to pain killers because of his childhood. When he tries to step away from narcotics and other prescriptions, hospitals want to put him in a \"rehab\" program- which is not covered by insurance- in order to \"help him\" get off narcotics. Of course, he can't really afford this. He is currently seeing a Pain Management doctor who only seems to give him more and more pain medicine instead to really getting down to the issue. He is not addicted to these painkillers in a psychological way, but his pain tolerance is now so incredibly low that his body takes twice as long to recover from surgeries and other medical procedures.   \n\n\nSO what I would like to discuss is this- Is Western medicine truly a misunderstanding of how the human body works (and structured around convenience) OR is this a trap for the health care field AND pharmaceutical companies to gain control over people?   \n\n\nI'll also bring up that the more I learn about holistic medicine, the more I feel like it is in true alignment with our bodies. I still believe that there are certain approaches in Western medicine that can benefit us but at the end of the day, I feel like it should be 90% holistic and 10% traditional western medicine.   \n\n\nThoughts?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 57850, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "Western medicine as a way to control individuals or simply a misunderstanding?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568830454, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d5kuzr/western_medicine_as_a_way_to_control_individuals/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "levissy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_371crle3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568743260, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d5ko3t/can_you_be_groundedanchored_while_lying_in_bed/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d5ko3t", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d5ko3t/can_you_be_groundedanchored_while_lying_in_bed/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568743261, "score": 2, "selftext": "As weird as this question may seem, it's very much genuine for me.

I did not believe in spirituality of any kind. Through a series of \"coincidences\" I ended up seeing a psychic medium who blew my mind. She brought through four loved ones in spirit with accurate details and things nobody could possibly know. This set off a years-long discover process of my own spirituality since she gave me incontrovertible proof that my previous (non-)belief system was flawed at best.\n\nI laughed at the first words she said to me at the time but I never forgot them: \"You see things, don't you?\".  \n\nFast forward about 5 years and through my own spiritual journey I discovered that I am a medium as well. In fact, I believe we all can be - it is a skill that can be learned and practiced though some are more naturally in tune than others. \n\nI have been studying and practicing this for the past couple years and I'm so grateful to be able to do this for people. I currently do not charge for these readings because I am looking for more one-on-one practice. Eventually, probably after the end of the year, I will need to start charging for my time.\n\nThus far, much of my practice has been with other mediums who are also practicing. I really want the opportunity/honor to practice more on \"regular\" folks (non-mediums).\n\nI welcome the opportunity to read for anyone of any faith (or lack thereof). I prefer those who are not mediums, and especially those who have never had a mediumship reading. I am also very open to reading for skeptics so long as they are not hardcore cynics. Skepticism is great - I still consider myself one - so long as you also have an open mind.\n\nThere is no catch to this. I am offering these readings by phone or by Zoom video (you can disable the video and use only audio if you prefer). I only prefer to know as LITTLE as possible about you beforehand so please don't post anything personal about yourself here if you sign up. My own head/thoughts can get in the way if I know too much about someone in advance.\n\nhttps://calendly.com/mediumship/practice\n\nPlease note these readings are all about providing you EVIDENCE of your loved ones in spirit. They will give me facts about themselves such as passing age, cause of death, personality, health, shared memories, career &amp; family info, sometimes dates &amp; names, etc.  They may also give messages of healing, love and support. There is NEVER anything negative that comes from these readings and I do not believe in \"evil\" spirits, curses and such. These are also not psychic readings - I'm not going to predict your future or tell you what to do in your life. This is strictly an opportunity to get proof of the continuity of life - that our consciousness continues in spirit after we leave our bodies.\n\nAlso, if anyone has questions about spirituality and mediumship, I'd be happy to answer those from my own experience.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 57835, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can I contact your loved ones in spirit for you?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568824554, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d5ji2t/can_i_contact_your_loved_ones_in_spirit_for_you/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Libra91xo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4igfnwrr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568737643, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d5jdye/manifested_my_new_life/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d5jdye", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d5jdye/manifested_my_new_life/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568737644, "score": 17, "selftext": "Just wanted to announce that I was given a great work opportunity to move to a new location to start my new life!

It is the voice of an angel that teaches the Torah anew each day. Every person must qualify himself through cleansing and purification for the soul to receive the light of the Torah that comes to the earth from heaven by the mouth of the Creator. Those chosen ones can listen to this heavenly voice and receive the divine of the Creator.\n\nEvery time a person begins to learn Torah, they need to prepare to learn it as if he/she were standing on Mt. Saini to receive the Torah like our ancestors. The modern-day ancestors of the tribes of Israel are not just the Jewish people.\n\nThe Jewish people are only one of the twelve tribes of the Nation of Israel. Ten of the twelve tribes were exiled and today their descendants are scattered among the nations of the world. They will all be included in the complete redemption and reunited with the Jewish people. The Nation of Israel will be reunited once again.\n\nIt will be very difficult for Jewish people to accept their lost brethren. Suddenly, they will be surrounded by spiritual giants, powerful souls on the same spiritual level as them and in some cases greater. The only difference between them is the exiled souls of Israel were lost and disconnected from the Torah, while their Jewish brethren sacrificed for generations to preserve its holy laws and teachings.\n\nHowever, when the spirit of Mashiach cleanses the earth and cleanses us from all negative character traits, we will not harbor any envy or jealousy towards each other. Rather we will unite in love and respect to pursue our common mission to work for the world\u2019s ultimate harmony. Being able to live in perfect peace and harmony with all mankind, with resources for everyone and of course understanding our spiritual nature and connection with the Creator.\n\nThe challenge is to remember the qualifications that allowed our ancestors to receive the Torah on Mt. Saini. They were a humble, united nation who were following the righteous leader of the generation who was Moses. We were a nation that together was like one man with one heart and soul, aimed at fulfilling the Divine Will and keeping the laws of the Creator. By that incredible and paramount unity in purity and holiness, we were able to merit the supernatural revelation of the Torah which is described as the Creator revealing Himself to us.\n\nIt is no surprise when we compare that lofty and noble level that our nation held in the ancient days to where we stand today, we are unable to hear the voice of heaven that continues to emanate to the earth until today.\n\nEven though we feel disconnected to those ancient days, we must not think to ourselves that the Creator has abandoned us, even though compared to the previous generations His supervision has appeared to have left us.\n\nIn reality, from the perspective of the Creator, He has been with us continually since the ancient days.\n\nWe see that in all generations there have existed certain truly righteous and holy individuals who have to lead those truth-seekers of their generations into the path of true divine service. These righteous leaders have left us books explaining their understandings that continue to light our way until today.\n\nMany of us have also felt the hand of divine providence guiding our lives in one way or the other. Whether it has assisted us, taught us valuable lessons, or simply reminded us that we are in the care of the Creator, as if He winked or waved at us reminding us that He is with us.\n\nAll these leaders, holy books, personal and experiences, are the Creator\u2019s supervision on us. He is with us just as he was in the ancient days when we experienced public miracles and revelations.\n\nThe only difference today lies within our distracted and disconnected hearts and minds. The supervision of the world today has put this generation in spiritual darkness, leaving the public largely unaware and disconnected from the Creator\u2019s presence.\n\nFrom the Creator\u2019s perspective, He has just the same amount of supervision and guidance on us as in the ancient days. The only difference is that in His wisdom He decides to send humanity though a decreasing spiritual level and increasing darkness until the final redemption will take place.\n\nOur job or mission during this time we find ourselves in this current generation of the divinely ordained exiles is simply to hold on to our faith in His ultimate plan. Even though we cannot see and experience the Creator\u2019s presence as our ancestors were able to, we must hold on to our belief in Him and in the final redemption. Even if we don\u2019t see results from our internal and external efforts in trying to purify ourselves to get close to Him or any other efforts to improve the lives of ourselves and others. We must continue through the darkness and when we do we will ultimately witness the Redemption ourselves, with healthy eyes.\n\nThis is a from a lecture of Rav Dror Moshe Cassouto of [www.emunah.com](http://www.emunah.com/?fbclid=IwAR0IVwOgOfd7lxtfHeSc4wf1aih89_EpG5MQjVP2KAO9aEt87JSE7vkOyks).

She tells me that at work \"liquor store\" that demons come in and she zaps them and sometimes they conspire ahainst her \"gang up\" on her but shes too powerful \"lower level demons\" ..ok i say.

I said no..we have clothes drying...well the cops showed up. Cops talked to her..him..myself and customers. Nothing came of it thankfully. It was then i realized its gone too far. So she watches youtube vids and i swear shes being brainwashed into thinking shes a \"healer\" ..now she said she is the soul source creator of the universe? Ok..when we finished laundry..the next day she realized our youngest didnt have much clothes that were washed. She yelled at my 12 year old and said that her guide which was her dead mother at the moment...told her my 12 year old didnt pack the youngest ones on purpose. Made my daughter cry the tounge lashing she gave her..total bullshit but you cant tell my gf NOTHING...SHE KNOWS ALL. she was on the verge of telling her Aunt that her son molested 20 kids...she wouldnt let a new friend of mine come over because hes a woman beater and a thief \" shes never met him\" ..he is a fairly new work associate...she said our neighbors friend tried spitting a \" curse\" at her and she deflected it..she does nothing but lay in bed..talk to herself and watch the spiritual videos on youtube..kind of like just people talking about that stuff. We just attended a wedding where she got drunk..shes an alcoholic..plus shes on lyrica..muscle pill and topamax? But she just got released from the pain clinic cause she never went to appointment. But at the wedding she was saying crazy stuff that some of her cousins are \"fairys\" and our daughter seen fairys. We visited her grandma in the hospital and the grandma was worried that a procedure would br too much a strain on her heart..docs agreed..but she insisted saint francis said shed be fine. She just asked them. Shes extremely lazy..i take care of our kids..clean..cook..everything. I asked her to please help...please pay attention to the physical world because we need her...so she changes my daughters pull up and throws it on the floor for me to find while i was mopping. I asked her if she was going to leave me and take my daughter if her guides said so..ahe got pissed..fought with me saying i was attacking her...i cant say a fucking word to her. Shes so lost and makes shit up to make me seem like im ridiculing her. She paid 100 bucks to some spiritual guy up the street for a session..but he could only do one so shes got to come back. Im poor..i struggle with bills..i cant even afford car insurance! She went to thod shaman in Nashville..jeff maybe? And he wasnt there bit texted him saying she was weeping at his door step and had an epiphany? I dont know. She wont help me understand and degrades me if i ask and says im attacking her. Im not..i just want any answers..there has been a lot more instances..accusations..my daughter recorded her talking to herself in tounges..it scares her. She acts all spiritual but is so mean to us. Shes very spoiled by her grandma btw..her mom passed when she was 10 so she basically had no rules growing up. Her grandma gives her money and bank card. We live in Nashville..her gma in Long Island. She bought 3 handles of whiskey amongst other shit..abusing her gmas generosity..got drunk af and took my 3 year old on a trip to the store to get her asleep. I had no clue untill she couldnt be found...i was livid. Guys..im seriously stuck..dont know wtf..i think shes so deep into wanting to be something that she doesnt know reality. I have to live in the physical realm. I have kids to raise. Im at the end of my rope. If i knew i could get custody of my youngest i would most likely leave her. I dont want to but she treats me like shit..beat my head in one night while i was half asleep cause i ignored her. Wtf...im sorry so long but i have no fucking clue whats going on. If anybody wants more info I will tell everything to anyone willing. What do you all think?

I feel so lost \n\nWhen I was very young I experienced sexual abuse. It created dissociation in me and just about almost 9 months ago I realized what had happened to me. I have been through a lot of other experiences (not sexual abuse related... you know just life) and I\u2019m very blessed about how far I come but for some reason I can\u2019t  heal from this situation. Mostly I think because I\u2019m angry about it. I try to tell my inner child it\u2019s not her fault and i need to forgive myself but I don\u2019t want to forgive my abuser. I don\u2019t know how to let this go. Lately it\u2019s been giving me so much anxiety to a point where I am experiencing sleep paralysis. I never had this before in my life and I don\u2019t even want to sleep right now because it just happened and it is one of the most scariest things I have experienced in a while. I just want to move on and release this pain that I have but I don\u2019t know how to. I think it caused me a lot of self worth and love problems I didn\u2019t realize I have or still have left to do. And I don\u2019t believe change happens over night and I don\u2019t think this will be solved in a day but I really want to get better and heal from this situation.

Like sometimes it's nice to have a beer, or watch a Netflix show, or play some videos games, but at the same time, I don't think it's healthy to do those things everyday or in a habitual way. To me, that is basically a form of addiction. \n\nHave any of you figured out a way of \"limiting\" yourself so that you can still indulge but also respect the activity/substance? I am struggling to understand where to draw those lines. Is every day too frequent? Probably. But, once a week seems quite arbitrary and I can't seem to rationalize why I would be choosing once a week vs. twice a week, etc. \n\nTLDR: How to do I monitor and control how often I do certain activities such as browsing Reddit and playing video games?

I\u2019m on a search of sorts and have posted the three situations below a number of times in a number of places over the last 21 years. I\u2019m looking for people with same or similar experiences.  I have yet to find even one.  I\u2019ve talked with a LOT of people and been told many things about me by various folks who were interpreting, from their perspective and experience, what I\u2019ve written below.  None of what I\u2019ve been told so far is the truth of me, I will know it when I hear it is about all I DO know. Lots of stories of lights going INTO people, none with light emerging from anyone.\n\n After posting these stories on many, many websites and forums for nine years, twelve years ago I taught myself to code and built a website explaining these three lights (with graphics I hired a young woman to create), and a spontaneous, what I call awakening, but others have told me is called Kundalini. My website is https://onepeople-oneworld.org. If you\u2019d take a look there, you can see more about them. I\u2019m not selling anything, just seeking. If you know of anyone, have heard of anything like these, I\u2019d like to know about that, if you would. My email address is there.\n\nI should also say that although I was raised in the Lutheran tradition, that for most of my life (I just turned 70) I've been more of a Carl Sagan type than anything else. These are the ONLY experiences out of the ordinary I've ever had and had they not happened to me I would be hard pressed to believe that they happened at all. Yet they did happen to me, that I can't deny.  I'd almost forgotten the first two over the years but when the third came, I decided they \"had\" to mean something and embarked on a search for that meaning, reading broadly and then posting them from time to time on various boards. I've met many wonderful people certainly, a nice blessing all by itself, but have met no one else who's had the same experience.  I am in no way unique and have to believe someone somewhere knows something that can help me understand what happened and why.\nSo, I have had three light experiences in my life.  They happened at ages 7, 15, and 46.  All different, yet the same.  Brief descriptions follow:\n\nAge 7, I was running in a darkened barn when I was suddenly halted and completely surrounded by bright white light (like standing in a silo of light) and felt/heard a whoosh of sorts.  My mind was just flooded with this feeling that this was NOT where I intended to be, that a mistake had been made, that I had been born in the wrong place, that this family was not mine.  The feeling passed and so did childhood.\n\nAge 15, I was standing in a church vestibule with two others, we were talking about our futures when I suddenly said, completely without volition, surprising me completely as I had NEVER considered this before, \u201cI think I want to work in the church.\u201d I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know why I said that. As I said it, a very bright white softball-sized globe rose slowly out of my chest to eyebrow level where it gently burst and dissipated like fireworks do as they fade? The other two didn\u2019t see anything and laughed at the idea of me working in a church. I never mentioned that possibility again to anyone. I wasn\u2019t spiritually seeking or even spiritually engaged, just glad to be done with confirmation at last.\n\nAge 46, I was at a Billy Graham crusade in Minneapolis, June 1996, sitting near the top of the stadium as I was only there for the experience (though I was at this time in spiritual turmoil for a number of reasons primarily fear for my youngest son, who actually ended up committing suicide 8 months later a month after his 21st birthday) of seeing Billy and wanted to be out of everyone\u2019s way when he issued his call to come to the floor.  I had NO intention of participating yet when he did issue his call, I found myself rising, without volition; as I stood another softball sized globe, this time bright gold with markings I couldn\u2019t understand, rose out of my chest and burst in the same exact spot and manner as did the white globe 31 years earlier, all three events were in June.\n\nI\u2019ve come a long way since then, my horizons have broadened in ways I never imagined, even with that, I have NO idea what these things mean and have been unable to find anyone else with similar experiences to talk to in an effort to understand them and what they mean.

Lot of body functions of humans are mystery and till date there is no respectful answer available with anybody. Medical science does lot of progress in last 100 years and medical instruments which they have invented are fabulous. The test which they perform from these instruments gives very valuable, life saving information. It is very difficult to obtain this information without these instruments and for a common man this information is more than magic. No doubt this development in medical science saves life of lots of people but think of the time when there are no such instruments and medical science was in his earlier stage, how difficult it was to save a life at that time.  So with the advancement of technology, realistic, meaningful and useful information have been achieving. Which can be used for the betterment of life? \n\nWe can hear and see things according to our strength which is inherent in all of us. The thing which lies outside our range, simply we cannot detect them but still they exit, directly and indirectly influences us too. Similarly  if we talk about these body chakras, whose existence is not accepted by the modern medical science and they remains as there until a more sophisticated instrument have not been invented which gives realistic information regarding them. Basically they work at very low unit therefore it is very hard to detect them but no doubt they exit and influences us too. Scholars and philosophers have different opinion regarding not even their position in the body but there Nos too. Till now no standard is applied on them therefore chakras are more consider as philosophy rather than treatment technique. But these chakras are energy centers and have a great importance in our life. If our chakras became unbalance then they not only ruin our health but social and mental life too. For a healthy body and mind your chakras should be balance and strong. These chakras are basically energy points.\n\nHindu, chines and some ancient civilization agreed upon the existence of different types of energy points in our body. These energy points are further classified according to their shape, size and position. These energy points are called chakras. In spirituality they play a major role and consider responsible for personality and characteristics of a persons. All the illness and diseases enters in the body through these chakras. So all the chakras must be balance and stable for disease free life. These body chakras are interrelated to different gland of our body and these glands have a marvelous effect on our body. These glands make different types of chemical which is known as hormones. The main works of these glands are to make a different hormones which stabilized mind and body, protect against diseases and forms our personality.\n\nDr. Richard Restak clinical professor of Neurology at the George Washington university America explains that the Hypothalamus gland in the mind and Adrenal gland above our kidney controls not only our body functions but our thinking and thought process also. Hypothalamus gland in the mind is very close to Pituitary gland. These glands in the chakra system are interrelated to third eye chakra (Aagya Chakra) and Adrenal gland above the kidney is interrelated to Solar Plexus chakra (in Hindhi Manipur Chakara). All chakras more specifically glands does not have any direct effect on our body like our heart, Lungs, Mind, Ear and Mouth etc have. We can still leave without their proper working. but they are more like the colors which gives life to lifeless paintings. Imagine a painting which is without colors and what happens when it is filled with the color. Now the painting becomes alive and attracts every one. Similarly the hormones which are produced by these glands have marvelous effects on our body system. Our personality became such that it will attract others. To live a happy and enjoyable life these all chakras must be balance and strong. Our all the chakras in the body are important but if our Solar plexus chakra became unbalance and weak then it makes our life miserable. Below problems may accour due to weak and imbalance Solar Plexus Chakra.\n\nMental illness like \n\nAnger\n\nTension\n\nIrritability\n\nUnknown fear\n\nDepression \n\nAnxiety\n\nFrustration\n\nViolence\n\nLifeless face\n\nDisease related to stomach  \n\nAcidity\n\nSugar\n\nBlood pressure\n\nCholesterol\n\nTumor\n\nPain in body and head\n\nDisease of Lever, kidney and blood\n\nBy reading the above list you can very easily understand the importance of balance and strong Solar Plexus chakra and how miserable it can make if became weak and unbalance.\n\nThere are many systems available by which you can very easily make your chakra strong. \n\nLike exercises and yoga, Concentration on chakras, energize chakras with colors etc.\n\nAll the Asana in yoga directly or indirectly stimulates, energize and balances our chakras. Asana woks at the microscopic level in our body. There is different asanas for every chakra. Some asana influences only one chakra, some two while some more than two chakras. Bujangasana, Dhanurasana and Trikonasana are most effective asana to balance and energize Solar Plexus chakra. We have to do these asana very slowly and wait or count up to 20 after attaining the targeted position of these asanas. Not particular to these asana every asana should be done very slowly and wait or count up to 20 after attaining the targeted position of that asana. Then only full benefit of that position will be achieved. These asanas are simple and one can learn them at self pace also but it is advisable to learn them in guidance of some instructor. Another One very simple technique to stimulate solar plexus chakra is by jumping. Stretch your both hands in frontward direction so that other person hold them easily or you can hold something which is stationary and cannot interfere in your jumping. Now start jumping  as much high as you can and do it  5 to 10 minutes. You have to jump at upward and downward direction , as much as high you can. This is wonderful, simple and very effective technique to energize the Solar Plexus chakra. \n\nOne more wonderful technique to energize and balance chakra is, energize them through different colors. There is one well know saying in meditation that energy follows our thought. We can send, receive and concentrate energy by simply thinking about that particular thing in our mind and it will be another matter that how much change it will create in that thing. This technique required to be learned and practice. like mathematics we can learn it but it required to be practice to gain mastery over it. Similarly this technique is very simple but it required to be practice to gain mastery over it. Once gain mastery over it then you can very easily balance any one of your chakra in more than no time. If you gain mastery over this technique then you will also get many other benefits.\n\nTo know more log into enjoywithsprituality.com", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 57601, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Solar Plexus Chakra: Secret of Happy life", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568717477, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d4yz0d/solar_plexus_chakra_secret_of_happy_life/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "dontyouworryangel", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4f0sctkw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568626293, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d4y9pi/psychic_attacks/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d4y9pi", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d4y9pi/psychic_attacks/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568626294, "score": 1, "selftext": "My dad came home after a while of being in another country.

It made me begin my research into chakras and telekinetic/qi based abilities. I also tried several types of meditations to unlock my chakras which thankfully I did.\n\nThen when I hit 13, I began having visions of myself in a back and blue armor with wings on my back in different time periods and in the future not far from now. I drew one out and I'm assuming that it originates a little over a couple million years before recorded history. Nothing gave me details, it's just like I knew, like a past life giving me details simultaneously as the vision played out. Even if it was just a flash.\n\nAfter that, the visions kept continuing. My research nearly driving me into madness to find out what it could possibly mean. I kept up with meditations as much as I could and began seeing the evil in materialism. I started to feel sub-human and went through so many excruciating trials in my life. But, I prevailed and kept my faith strong. But I still wasn't truly awakened.\n\nThen one day on april 29th 2019 I attempted a past life regression, but instead because I was so irritated and tired of listening to the voices of guided meditations that I was mocking the narrator as the video went on, I triggered a flash forward. Windows passing by me of future events for this life and simultaneously being given a summary of what many call \"the event\" or armageddon by my higher consciousness that was now willing to help me learn about myself and reality. I had then learned that I'm a warrior Earth Angel sent here to help and protect as many as I can. So many pieces of future memories fighting evil dark forces in times of horrible chaos after many beings all over the universe had all ascended to the spiritual realms. Many of us who were still here physically were here to battle each other as a trial to see where our hearts stood. So many beings were being pushed together to try and survive that they had fled their own worlds. \n\nI then got to the final moments of this life. It was in the middle of an urban conflict and everything looked so destroyed and it must've been going on for so long that swords returned to warfare.I was fighting a leader whose face was blurred out as if I'm not supposed to know who he is yet. He was wearing a very dark green uniform with light metal body armor. I was wearing the armor, but more angelic and the parts that were blue were glowing and the wings were protracted instead of collapsed as in other visions. We were fighting with our blades, mine being wrist mounted. He managed to stab me through my heart and my back pinning me to a wall. Out of chance I rose my right arm and shot him in the face with my wrist mounted spiritual energy cannon. He fell to the ground, I then pulled the sword out of my chest and threw it next to his body. I instantly died and began falling to the ground when suddenly a huge metallic being slid on her knees to catch me. She was completely silhouetted by a fire behind her and couldn't see any features besides her bright blue eyes. She picked me up and I looked like a small animal in her arms. She just stared and she began to cry. She then turned around and looked at me, I didn't realize that I was actually there spiritually from present day. I looked myself over and I was wearing the armor from then. I then looked back at her and didn't have a voice, so I mouthed \"I'm so sorry, everything will be okay.\" I then smiled and she smiled back and then my spiritual form faded to ash in the breeze. I woke up at around 11:30 P.M. crying at what I had just experienced. \n\nThat's when I truly became awakened and knew my true purpose of existence here on Earth. I now await my goal while becoming stronger spiritually, physically, and mentally. I know that even if I perish here, everything will have been worth it.\n\nI hope you guys have enjoyed my story.

It is important in psychokinesis as well. These past few years I've came up with an idea about a specific technological material that reads our subconscious minds. As it does this it reflects back to us our hidden feelings and emotions. These would be abstract images, colors and subtle sounds of our emotions and thoughts, but we would be so deeply insync with what we are seeing that we would understand it. Because it would be allowing us to see our selves in it. Making it personally familiar to us. Putting us in an organic, positive hypnotized state. It would be metallic in appearance and the object would shift in any shape and color. Similar to a mood ring it would read our emotions,  but the difference is we would be able to feel it and briefly see visual images (that would pop up in our mind) of things we would need to see to learn about our selves. Our selves as individuals. It would be a mirror reflection. \n\nA device that would stand the test of time. Growing and evolving at every state of our personal lives. For every generation. Forever remaining new and fresh for every individuals personal preference of any era. Because every person who looks into this technological material will see and feel a new reflection and angle of them selves they have never seen. At any stage of their life. Keeping it forever mysterious and in a constant state of personal development. \n\nTeaching us to help our selves. As we stare into this material we would slowly resolve any personal problems and maintain a sense of emotional clarity. All by looking inward. \n\nIt's actually very similar to life it self. Life you can say is this constant changing and evolving reality that allows us to self reflect and learn. To improve us as individuals.

Let me stand contrary to that assertion.  Using \"Science-ism\", I can prove the existence of our one true living God, and also that the Bible is the Divinely inspired word of God, even though men have tried to manipulate the Canon, and hide the Truth from us all since time in memorium.  Those who would actually look into it, would find that Science, in all aspects, point to the existence of our Creator.  From the fact that random number generators, aren't so random, at the quantum level. And also, how impossibly rare and against all odds that we as humans, are alive is something like 10/-30th power.  Which basically means impossible.  The accepted paradigm has Humans coming by stars exploding, forming planets, and planets eventually sustaining single cell organisms, and those prokaryotes morphed into tadpoles that came onto land and evolved into monkeys? I can barely type this with a straight face...  If we descended from chimps, then why are there still chimps?  And if the fact that life is  so improbable already, what do you think the odds could be that our life evolved from a distant reptilian turned monkey?  In other words, it is impossible.  This basically denies the THEORY of evolution by itself.  I understand not everyone is ready to comprehend or accept Biblical Cosmology, but that does not negate it's truth.  The truth is, it is actually easier to prove our Creator, then it is to prove evolution or any other theory.  Just look at all the deception.  How Siri knew other gods, but failed to know who Jesus was?  Or how religion, in particular Christianity has been stripped from our schools, and government.  How people falsely preaching the word of God, just to steer would be believers away.  Look how many God fearing Christian kids graduate college and are now Atheists. Look how Christians are attacked and are the most reviled of all Religions.  Could this be because Jesus IS the ONLY WAY?  I know the truth, and I pray one day you come to know it as well. This is done by design, but why?  Could the Bible be true, and there has been a deliberate attempt to conceal the truth from us since day one? I know there has been, and can prove it.  Look at the Illuminati's handbook and their creed.  Especially the second paragraph.  People need to wake up.  We all have been lied to and no one is worse off then anyone else.  We are all in this together.  We need to stop fighting amongst ourselves, it is exactly what they want.  You dont have to believe the truth just yet, but please dont fall for the lie.  I pray you all come to Jesus, before it is too late.

I am pasting this theory of mine that I sent to my friend. So it is not FULLY optimized and it is a bit improper but none the less, it gets my theory through.\n\nI want to post this to the spiritual community before posting it to the scientific community (which worries me slightly) and get your opinions on this. Note, I did not check to see if this theory is already existing. I assume in some parts, it exists already, though it is fully mine.\n\nHere is my theory on consciousness and it's relation to dreaming/lucid dreaming\n\n====\n\nThere is consciousness and then the physical world and consciousness exists within the physical world, either through the brain or it's fully outside of it but somehow restrained within it but I think within the brain It's like an adapter, a non physical thing, using the brain as an adapter in order to experience the physical world and it's restrained and we allllll experience full restraint of consciousness. Through dreaming we don't think (normally) during dreams, it's the subconscious aka the physics of the brain acting independent of consciousness and I think we have them for some reason, maybe to learn, so we can improve our consciousness, idk about that part BUT only SOME of the population, lucid dreams and I am among that population.\n\nDuring a lucid dream, there is a moment of realization. It never starts out as a lucid dream you pick up on something that just isn't right and at the moment, you become aware you are dreaming AND weirdly enough, even though you are aware of it, this reality doesn't come into thought, yet you are fully conscious. So, my theory Is that, those that can lucid dream, either have a natural low restraint of consciousness which is purely physical and your consciousness while experiencing, can sneak through or, somehow, there are levels of strength in consciousness and some people have a higher power of consciousness.\n\nBut you can also apparently train yourself to lucid dream. Which either means, you can strengthen your consciousness, or loosen the restraints on it but, I believe, you can loosen the restraints, that seems more likely. Because in DMT trips and other trips, there have been cases of healing or getting rid of certain sub conscious thoughts, and that is through conscious action. Note, I have never personally experienced any kind of trip but I have researched them.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 57547, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A theory on consciousness and dreaming", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568686164, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d4u9qy/a_theory_on_consciousness_and_dreaming/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lexiirgz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4lig5b7o", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568599425, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d4u77w/can_anyone_explain_the_spiritualbiblical_meaning/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d4u77w", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d4u77w/can_anyone_explain_the_spiritualbiblical_meaning/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568599738, "score": 1, "selftext": "Not from a dream", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 57546, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can anyone explain the Spiritual/Biblical meaning of maggots?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568685808, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d4u77w/can_anyone_explain_the_spiritualbiblical_meaning/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "seaniehigs", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3wu407lj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568598698, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d4u289/question_weird_story/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d4u289", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d4u289/question_weird_story/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568599273, "score": 2, "selftext": "So, this is like really weird and I can accept that.

Do not worry about tomorrow, or next week, or next year or what happened in the past. Just enjoy what is right in front of you and cherish that moment.\n\n3. Love everyone unconditionally.

They have been through a unique life experience to shape them to who they are today with their predetermined path.\n\n4. Reflect each day on what you could improve on. Be curious of what you can do to grow, expand, and become better than before. Only compare yourself to who you were yesterday, nobody else.\n\n5.

I\u2019ll manage.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t help but notice there are way too many people who tip-toe around each other as if they are a burden to the world. As if to say \u201cI\u2019m truly sorry that I exist. I will do my best to make myself as small as possible so that you are not inconvenienced by my mere presence.\u201d I see this everywhere I go, whether it\u2019s the customers I encounter at work, my friends, my partner or even *myself*. I remember the way I use to walk around the apartments/houses I\u2019d share with others and literally tip-toe so as not to make too much noise. Or I would avoid using the shared spaces for fear that someone else needed it or that I would be noticed/judged for whatever I did.\n\nI\u2019ve done some thinking to try and unpack why people go on living like this, and I think there are a few dynamics at play here:\n\n* People in general lack self-respect, self-love and self-esteem. They see themselves as inferior and in constant competition to the people around them. They are living in total separation.. which is the polar opposite to the enlightened notion of non-dual oneness (our true nature).\n* On some level, people actually believe they don\u2019t have equal right to be here on this planet and as a part of society. They don\u2019t necessarily see their being born as a conscious choice. They don\u2019t value their life as sacred, and more or less see it as meaningless in comparison to others who are perhaps more worthy, important or deserving.\n* People easily confuse this behavior with being \u201cnice\u201d. They believe they are actually acting in the highest ideal when they pander to others (at the expense of themselves). It\u2019s a sort of over-compensation to the selfishness we see most people lost in (which is equally messed up). And so, they reinforce their behavior with this justification because they want so badly not to be seen as the asshole.\n\nAll of these reasons are quite obviously distortions from the fact of the matter, which is the following: you not only have just as much right to exist as anybody else, this entire reality and thing we call life ***is you****.* You are not separate from it in any way, shape or form. Any sense of separation is a mere construct of your programmed mind, your ego. The truth of the matter is that we\u2019re all walking around co-existing and co-creating all of this reality, believing we\u2019re individuals when in fact we are all fragmentations of the same energy (the source of all of creation).\n\nTo be fair, most everybody operates from this place of individuality to varying degrees (unless of course you are Jesus or the Buddha). But you will also notice that not everyone is walking around so apologetically either. There are those who are completely grounded in their bodies, know who they are and are not afraid to impose themselves on the world around them.. both to help others, and to get what is needed when necessary. When we come across people like this, we don\u2019t think \u201cwhat an asshole!\u201d.. we actually admire their polite shamelessness.\n\nI believe it is so important to aspire to this more ideal, balanced way of being if you desire to grow to experience new possibilities and start re-engaging with the world in a profound way. You are allowed to ask for help. You are allowed to mess up from time to time and god forbid \u201cinconvenience\u201d another. You are allowed to emit all the noises that go along with being a human. You are allowed to exist! Just as much as every living/non-living, seen/unseen thing in this world. You are it.. all of it. And so is absolutely everything else around you.\n\nSo please, stop apologizing! Instead of saying \u201cexcuse me, I\u2019m sorry\u201d.. maybe try, \u201cexcuse me.. **thank you**!\u201d And you don\u2019t have to be a dick about it either, that\u2019s the other extreme. Just do so as if you are constantly aware of the sacredness of all of reality that not only includes you, but *is you*. It\u2019s all you!

You will all be tested in the coming days, whether you wish to believe the messages we are giving you or not. No one will be left out, because this is the triumph you all came here to experience, even if you do not remember the contract you made with us and with your Higher Self.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe test you will all experience is, as you might expect, the opportunity to leave behind all anxiety, all fear, all anger and all self-doubt and self-loathing, to raise your energy to a higher vibration. This does not mean you will feel more \"wired.\" In fact, the higher vibrations of Love are based in a calm state which many of you have called, \"grace.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMother Earth has already made her transition to a higher vibrational level. Many of you are lagging behind because of your nostalgic connection to the 3-D lives you have experienced here over eons. You will be asked to change. This idea brings horror to many of you. You hate change, you resist it with all your might. Those of you who prefer to be in charge, in control, the \"master of your own fate\" will have a difficult time relinquishing the fantasy that you have done it all on your own. No one has, of course. You have always had the benevolent force of our Love and the great Love of your Higher Self, your Twin Flame and your Guides to create opportunities for you, to ease your way along your path.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou may ask, \"Well, if they were helping me so much, then why did they let me suffer so many times?\" The answer is simple, Dear Ones. We had a contract with you that we would not intervene when you are learning the lessons you came here to learn of your own free will. You came here to be tested, not to have a vacation, for what great lessons have you ever learned while sipping margueritas on a beach? It is only through the interaction with your fellows, testing your integrity and your capacity to feel Love for even the most unloveable among you, that many of you have risen to the level of Ascended Master. It is now time for the rest of you to move into that higher realm of experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou are going to the 5th dimension. You have two pathways open to you. One is to triumph over all old fears and doubts, raise you vibration now and ascend in the first waves of Ascended Masters and their apprentices. The second option is to resist, cling to the 3D world you have known, and go through the death process now, without finishing out your present life. You will return to Us for your respite between lives as you have always done, and continue the repeating incarnation process elsewhere in the Universe of planets which will provide further challenges and training, until you are ready to ascend as a soul to the 5th dimension and beyond.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is one caveat, however. By choosing Plan B, you will be breaking your sacred vow to yourself and your fellow humans, who have planned for thousands of years for this to be a group ascension in which no soul will be left behind. Except for rare exceptions for advanced souls whose contracts called for sacrificing their lives in the last weeks as part of the lesson to their loved ones to care, to Love, and to embrace each other, all Beings who are here now in these final weeks have been volunteers in the Great Plan of Ascension of Humankind on Planet Earth. This plan has been overseen by your Great Sananda-Jesus, and will be ultimate triumph of the Christ Consciousness. It will lift the vibration of the entire Multiverse as you lift yourselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, all of you are destined for greatness. From the most humble beggar to the wealthiest CEO, you are all in this together. The roles you have chosen for this life are just the final chapter in your learning process - the opportunity you chose to learn your own most important lessons in humility, leadership, compassion, and most importantly, Faith.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour contracts for this incarnation are now finished; you have all been freed of the illnesses, handicaps and burdensome responsibilities you have borne throughout this lifetime. It is now your final work to reclaim the channels in your brain which allow you to think of yourself as worthy, blessed with perfect health and endless happiness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook around you now. Embrace those you have loved imperfectly. Forgive those you have resented, looked down upon and disrespected, and ask for their forgiveness of you. All have played their roles in your learning process; all are owed great thanks and Love. Even those who have appeared to embrace evil, who have committed heinous acts, and those who suffered at their hands, have been part of the impetus for you to turn away from those acts, to reject evil, and to grow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven the ones you called Hitler, Genghis Kahn, Pol Pot, the proponents of \"ethnic cleansing,\" murder and racial divisiveness were played by your highest Ascended Masters, who sacrificed all to create conditions so horrific, so abhorrent, that it would change the world for the better, as a powerful backlash against them and all they stood for. It was their way of revealing to all the glaringly hideous results of divisiveness and prejudice, and to counteract the creeping, secretive forms of evil which had seeped into your cultures as the Dark Ones gained in power.\n\n \n\nThe Darkness which descended on Earth in recent centuries, in the form of invading Dark Ones from other low-vibration planets, was permitted to continue, to play out its power, to be ultimately defeated by those who were the Light-Bearers throughout the darkest years. Theirs was the greatest power, held strong by the greatest Faith. They have been your role models, your heroes and saints. They are your great Ascended Masters who are with you now, who are here to lead you through the open portals into the 5th dimension, where you will be celebrated as heroes and saints yourselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo not turn away from these words. Do not scoff and doubt their Truth because it may not agree with things you have been taught in this life, or the things you hear on your popular media. Jesus himself was not a media celebrity in his own time. His message spread from person to person, with testimony from those whose lives he personally touched, just as you have done with these messages. Kathryn and Anne have purposely not sought fame or fortune, but have built the family of their readers and listeners through personal contact and attention to individual needs, insofar as their time and energy permitted. In this way, they have demonstrated the integrity of their hearts and by association, the validity of their message. If you consider yourself a religious person, hear the most basic Truth in our words: Love is all, conquers all, heals all. If you are an atheist, hold fast to your belief in your own power, and join with your fellows to ascend to higher dimensions. You will find Us to be not the God you objected to, and you will find that in essence, you were right to follow our dear Lucifer's teachings of self- reliance, responsibility and independence. We honor your uniqueness and your independence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe speak as the God many of you have worshipped by whatever name your teachings applied to Us. Names do not matter; our message is one of Love, Compassion, Joy, Forgiveness and Oneness. This is the theme you have been taught to listen for in order to avoid false teachings and false prophets. We do not preach divisiveness or hatred - it is against Universal Law, which is our final Guide - the unending belief in the Equality of all souls. We are all the blessed children of Prime Creator, the Creator of all Creators, for whom there is no beginning and no end, who is eternal Love.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI, Mother God, am here with you now, embodied as artist, friend and compatriot of your Lady Portia, who calls herself Sila Valez. Father God has been embodied as the one you knew as Zorra, and your beloved Sananda, the one you knew as Jesus, will indeed return within days, to lead you once more. This time there will be no suffering, no death. It will be as he showed you long ago: You will ascend with him, in triumph and in joy.\n\nYou will return to the 5th dimension, where we will welcome you, surrounded by your ancestors, you friends who passed before you, and your Archangels and Guides who have faithfully watched over you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFind your path Home, Dear Ones. Envision it now, as you envisioned it long ago in the Council of Planet Earth's enthusiastic supporters. You are one of those supporters, and it is now time to reap the rewards for your thousands of years of hard work and hope.\n\nWe have achieved our goal at last.

I have been a lurker for a while now, and this is my first Reddit post. Sorry it\u2019s a little lengthy. \n\nI just wanted to share something interesting, and I am wondering if people have had similar experiences. \n\nMy life has been pretty chaotic in the past four months. Major surgery, intense negative family and work situations/problems, new foster doggie. It hasn\u2019t been easy, but it hasn\u2019t broken me and won\u2019t break me, either. As strange as it sounds, in the midst of the chaos, I have found a peaceful joy that I have lessons to learn from this that will help me towards more spiritual growth. \n\nOk, here comes the interesting part. In the past two months or so, I have experienced many synchronicities in dreams and my waking life about shadows. Concepts of shadows, shadow symbol, Jungian shadow work. The more I started to become aware of this, the more my interest grew. I started doing research on Jung\u2019s shadow theory (which I had never heard of before), and I quickly realized that shadow work is exactly what I have been doing intuitively while, coincidentally, my body heals from the physical trauma of the surgery - really facing my fears, flaws, ego reflections, and unhealed parts of myself head-on. And like the surgery and outer struggles, it hasn\u2019t been easy, but I find peace and joy in the process of feeling the pain and working through it. I have been spending much time meditating, journaling, and doing self-introspection, and my awareness of my shadow has grown, too (so much that with almost any negative emotion or reaction I have these days, I quickly get a voice that says \u201coh hey, it\u2019s your shadow!\u201d) \n\n\nOn to visions of Higher Self. When I did my Reiki I attunement last year, I received a strong vision of a wise old man looking deeply into my third eye. I had no idea who he was, but he felt so familiar. I got very emotional then, because this presence brought me an overwhelming amount of comfort, love, and peace I had never felt before. But also a deep sense of strength and knowledge. Since then, any guided meditations I\u2019ve taken part of (or any self-guided mediations) about connecting with my Higher Self, in my meditative state, I visit with this man. We have conversations. He is just as knowledgeable, strong, humble, kind, and loving as he was the first time his image appeared to me. I have since accepted that he is a representation of my Higher Self.\n\nFast forward to today. I am reading about Jungian archetypes, doing some more self-introspection. I come across this online test about Jungian archetypes on a psychology website. I think, \u201cWhy not?\u201d \n\nInteresting synchronicity - my Self archetype is \u201cWise Old Man.\u201d \n\nAnd to make the experience even more interesting, I asked my husband to take the same test, and we get the same results. \n\nDoes anyone else have really powerful synchronicities in their lives? Life is so interesting sometimes, and to me,  it almost feels like the mysticism and magic of it becomes more palpable every day - even when days aren\u2019t pretty. \n\nThank you for reading and letting me share!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 57463, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Synchronicities, Jungian Archetypes, Higher-Self Visions", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568678952, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d4n798/synchronicities_jungian_archetypes_higherself/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "EnlightenedOneLA", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4l3cn9l9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568565041, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d4mr9n/anyone_ever_experience_a_real_mysticaltype/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d4mr9n", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d4mr9n/anyone_ever_experience_a_real_mysticaltype/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568565043, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 57456, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Anyone ever experience a real, mystical-type kundalini awakening?

In order for this dream to seem like the only \"life\" you have ever had, you had to choose as a spirit before the Big Bang to FORGET you are an eternal spirit and to FORGET that you scripted this horrible \"life\" you are living. \n\nYes, you scripted your so-called OCD and all the other horrible &amp; painful aspects of your mostly miserable existence here in this temporary, physical world. No, you did not script the horrible stuff for the purpose of learning or so-called spiritual growth. You are a perfect spirit and have always been perfect and always will be perfect. You are *Perfect Eternal Conscious Energy*. You were never created or born or imagined. You have always been alive as an eternally conscious entity. Your *Homestate of Awareness* is RealityHeaven. It is your never-changing Original Reality of absolute spiritual sanity &amp; sobriety. Death is simply a return to your *Original Reality*, your Original Sanity &amp; Sobriety. What are you to do there throughout forever &amp; ever? You can rest...and when that gets boring, you can script dreams of realities that change and are full of color &amp; action and then you can voluntarily choose to forget your spiritual self and forget you scripted this dreamlife and LIVE IT OUT LIKE IT'S THE ONLY LIFE YOU HAVE EVER HAD OR WILL HAVE. \n\n**Eternity** means the *middle of forever*. **Life** means *consciousness*.

Suggestions with attitude also deliver quicker results because they capture emotion and create a belief. Most of the time, attitude-suggestions don\u2019t start with \u201cI am\u201d or \u201cyou are.\u201d Typically they are statements.\n\nI will give you a list of attitude-suggestions that I put together for the sake of example. Notice how different you feel when reading these, as opposed to the typical cookie-cut affirmations you will find everywhere. I made sure these aren't jaw-dropping suggestions because I want you to notice how an average or lousy attitude-suggestion can still outdo a stellar affirmation. You will see that attitude-suggestions violate many rules on making a proper affirmation, but remember, these technically aren't affirmations. Therefore, if you find a suggestion that gives you an uplifting or empowering feeling then throw the \u201crules\u201d out the window and use it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nATTITUDE-SUGGESTIONS:\n\n\u201cInstead of crucifying yourself in the name of comparison, honor yourself in the name of uniqueness.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a good thing if your family irritates and annoys you at times because that means you have one.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's only until you accept yourself and be yourself that you will know who's worthy to be in your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe cautious around the people who call you selfish because most of them are trying to manipulate you to do what they want you to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are over 7 billion people in this world. Don\u2019t waste your time on the 5 who are bringing you down\u201d\n\n\u201cNever judge a person\u2019s story by the chapter you walked in on\u201d\n\n\u201cYour feedback of others depends on how they reflect off of you. If you are true to yourself, you will see the truth in others.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour legacy is the result of your influence in this game called \u201clife.\u201d Therefore, what matters most at the end of this game is the scoreboard shows you participated. If you are not on the scoreboard, then you have lived in vain.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVERSUS\u2026\u2026.COOKIE-CUT AFFIRMATIONS:\n\n\u201cEach day, you are developing new and positive habits and attitudes. Your ability to conquer your challenges are limitless.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour potential to succeed is infinite. You have the power to change your life by changing your thoughts.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSee the difference? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCookie-cut affirmations talk AT you while attitude-suggestions talk TO you. Attitude-suggestions talk to your soul. Attitude-suggestions don\u2019t insult the intelligence of your subconscious mind. Attitude-suggestions prepare you for life and the real world. Attitude-suggestions aren\u2019t vague or require you to strain yourself in order to grasp what is being said. Instead, they \u201cfeed\u201d you their intent and meaning. You know what is being suggested the moment you read an attitude-suggestion. \n\nI'm now going to give you a powerful tip. Most of the time, quotes are suggestions with attitude. I will show you that you need not do this alone. Your brothers and sisters from the past and present have all given you a gift of attitude that you can also make your own. Also, they are very easy to find. First, you need to figure out what area of your life you would like to improve. After that, go to an Internet search engine and type the desired quote category based on what you want to improve on. You can also type \u201cquotes site\u201d in a search engine, click on a quotes-site, then scroll down the categories and pick the new attitudes you wish to call your own.\n\nAs you read the quotes, seek the AHA reaction. It must hit you like a fist going through the screen. If it doesn't hit you like a brick then move onto the next quote. Just remember that the emotional response should be one where you are taken back a bit. If it gives you the chills and/or makes you smile, then it's a good one. That AHA feeling of excitement is your subconscious telling you that something about that quote is special for you. It\u2019s an attitude you need. (((It\u2019s the next step up from where you are at)))\n\nHere\u2019s a quick story to give you an example of the power an attitude-suggestion holds. This is a suggestion that will kill someone if she isn't already dead. This girl was raised with love and apparently admired the ground that the person who raised her walked on. I say this because she had an answer for everything as if she were programmed like a robot. She would respond without hesitation and had a reason for everything. She was eighteen at the time which is why I came to this conclusion.\n\nI was twenty-two at the time, working for a company that creates leads for construction work on homes. We worked in a tight, cubicle-filled office which is why we could hear everything that anyone was saying. One day she was talking about something. I don't remember what it was about, which is relevant because it will prove my point all the more. All I can remember was responding to her jabber by suggesting she drink water because it will help. Her serious, no-nonsense, non-hesitant response was, \u201cWater is where fishies make love; I don't drink water, I only drink juice and milk.\u201d \n\nNo disrespect to my readers but she was morbidly obese with a body that had the near-perfect contour of a falling water-drop. Worse than that is she was most likely prediabetic at the early age of eighteen. Milk is designed to make a baby calf gain four-hundred times more its body-weight than a calf who doesn't drink milk. The sugar in the juice will spike her insulin throughout the day, making weight gain inevitable. Also, consuming pasteurized products throughout the day, every day, will cause considerable harm to the body.\n\nAnyway, needless to say, I was a bit taken aback. I couldn't believe she makes nutritional decisions based on such silly nonsense. However, it's an attitude-statement that was told to her once upon a time and might be the death of her, unhappily ever after. If one measly attitude-suggestion has the power to stick in my head for 20 years and also destroy a girl\u2019s health, can you imagine what a list of empowering attitude-suggestions can do for you?\n\nHere\u2019s a final note. Attitude-suggestions and quotes work best when you put yourself in a good state of mind, then record them. Record each one once, then listen to the full track of suggestions/quotes at least 3 times a day. Audacity is audio software that you can download for free and use to record your suggestions. From there you can transfer them to any device of choice to listen from on a daily basis. \n\n\\~Nicholas D\u2019Arezzo\\~", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 57444, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Create A Custom Affirmations-List That Fits Your Needs Like A Glove, Even if You\u2019re a novice", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568678124, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d4lgpk/create_a_custom_affirmationslist_that_fits_your/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "fleur30", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3o1mfedl", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568558652, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d4lbq2/my_most_important_journey_so_far_spirituality_a/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d4lbq2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General"}], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d4lbq2/my_most_important_journey_so_far_spirituality_a/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568558653, "score": 43, "selftext": "i hope to tell you the story of how i became a storyteller. how i learned to love writing through reading others\u2019. how this year (2019) turned out to be my most spiritual year yet after i decided that religion is not for me. how love is universal just like language and water and you and me. how kindness is slowly becoming a life goal amongst many. how loneliness is necessary to recognize togetherness. how art is as simple as being naked. how speaking kind words to plants help them live longer and more beautiful. how i do not believe in \u201cyou only live once\u201d anymore. how i once read that \u201cforgiveness does not require reconnection\u201d. how it helped my mother heal. how i became more awakened when i am asleep. how laundry could mean forgetting. how meditation changed my life. how saying no to others is saying yes to yourself. how selfishness sometimes is self-love, too. how familiarity is a form of security. how listening is also an effective way to communicate. how lazy days are oftentimes necessary. how i fear the day i stop dreaming. how mundane things are lovely. how the best gifts are often unwrapped. how some feelings cannot be named. how rejection is a form of protection. and how wanting to be brave is already being brave.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 57442, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "my most important journey so far (spirituality) / a writing", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568678059, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d4lbq2/my_most_important_journey_so_far_spirituality_a/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "NameOfSonOfMan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4h03fdkg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568552953, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d4k89z/anyone_here_who_has_broad_knowledge_concerning/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d4k89z", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d4k89z/anyone_here_who_has_broad_knowledge_concerning/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568552953, "score": 1, "selftext": "Please share some thoughts about twin flames...  \n...if you meet someone who feels like your twin flame or soul mate, how to make difference and resolve your doubts?

In all living entities, one spirit soul is there, although they have different bodies in terms of their previous work. As described in the Seventh Chapter, the manifestation of the living force in every body is due to the superior nature of the Supreme Lord. Thus to see that one superior nature, that living force, in every body is to see in the mode of goodness. That living energy is imperishable, although the bodies are perishable. The difference is perceived in terms of the body because there are many forms of material existence in conditional life; therefore they appear to be divided.

It seems like a lot of weird stuff has been going on with me after this event.\n\nThis specific thing is that when I\u2019m dreaming, I\u2019m in someone else and I can access their memories and feel the emotions that come with that. They are at different times, what I would assume by these experiences is more or less present day but a few from centuries ago. They are about people I\u2019ve never met and don\u2019t know anything about. A few are definitely not present time. Here are a few of them. \n\nI dreamed about answering the phone somewhere on the west coast of US. As I was looking through the window and about to answer, I was looking out at a backyard. A small boy that was my son (in the dream, not in real life) was talking to a man in a military uniform that I hadn\u2019t seen in a very long time and I was astonished he was there. The man looks at me and raises his finger to his lips and moves his head side to side. I get the feeling no one is supposed to know he\u2019s there. \n\nI finally start hearing whoever is on the phone. It\u2019s the military asking me if I\u2019ve seen the man that is now in the backyard. They tell me he has gone awol from his base and that he is armed and highly dangerous. I say that no I haven\u2019t seen him. I\u2019m feeling extremely afraid. I hang up the phone and the man in the backyard is gone. \n\nI later find out that he shot a bunch of people and was coming for me. I don\u2019t remember anything after that. I just woke up screaming and really afraid. I can\u2019t remember the name right now but the man in my dream in the uniform was the man who shot up a bar in I think Seattle? Nothing like this has ever been in the media attached to his story but nonetheless, it was the same man. \n\nI dreamt another time that I was in the operating room in a hospital. I had some extremely rare brain cancer that I was about to have this extremely risky procedure where I would be dead for a little while, technically. I\u2019m on the operating table and I\u2019m cold and shivering. I momentarily think about pulling out my IV\u2019s and running. But I don\u2019t. I also have a metal halo bolted to my skull. That won\u2019t be easy to remove by myself. \n\nThe anesthesiologist is putting a mask over my mouth. Someone says to me \u201cWe talked about this. We have to kill you to cure you.\u201d I feel the anesthesia starting to take effect and I\u2019m trying to fight it. Someone tells me to count backwards from ten and I\u2019m crying and begging them to please don\u2019t let me die. And I\u2019m fighting with this mask and I\u2019m saying that I changed my mind and I don\u2019t want to do this but every second is getting harder and harder for me to fight or even talk. And everything goes black. \n\nI had another where I had an idea that I was a male advisor to a woman who was married to a pharaoh. We were inside a pyramid and there were all these torches lit around us. There were statues of the gods underneath cloth everywhere around us. They were meant as an offering so that the pharaoh could safely cross over to the afterlife. \n\nThe pharaohs body is brought out by a procession of men carried above them. There are urns and gold all around us. They lay the pharaohs body down on an alter and someone says to take the coverings off of the statues. They do but everyone starts screaming. \n\nAll of the statues of the gods\u2019 heads are cut off and laying in pieces. The woman starts screaming at a man that was the pharaohs closest person and he laughs at her. He tells her that she is not taking the place of the pharaoh because he\u2019s the one who deserves it. He\u2019s the one who desecrated the statues. \n\nThe servants that carried the pharaohs body out start killing everyone not on their side. Including me, while I try desperately to save the woman but I don\u2019t and I die. So does she, and then I wake up. \n\nThese are just three of my dreams. I get these regularly. I feel all the emotions attached to these thoughts. I posted about this in a different subreddit to see if anyone can explain this weirdness to me. Someone said that when I dream, I might be helping other people cross over after a death. Or I\u2019m a part of them and that\u2019s how I know their memories and their feelings. I don\u2019t know. I just wanted to post this on here and see if anyone else has any idea about this weirdness. \n\nAlso, I have almost perfect recall of these dreams. Some I\u2019ve had years and years ago. I still remember every detail. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to get a nights sleep without having these ridiculously messed up vivid dreams. I don\u2019t know if it means something or if I\u2019m supposed to learn something from them. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. \n\nAnd thank you to anyone who took the time to read this whole thing.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 57313, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I have absolutely insane dreams that I have almost perfect recall of but they are memories and the emotions attached to those memories of people I\u2019ve never met before or know anything about.

Sorry it's a bit long but here's my experience, I could really use some advice on this:\n\nAs I became more and more relaxed I was hovering horizontally over a deep hole in the ground facing toward the sky. Every breath in pulled my body up and out of the hole, and every breath out sank my body further down into the hole. It almost felt like a struggle for my mind to let myself go. After about a minute or two of this I finally took a deep breath out and plummeted all the way down to the bottom of the hole and landed on my back. I laid at the bottom of this hole for a moment before realizing the hole broke out into tunnels and it was almost a hollow cavern underground. I asked for guidance, and I heard a lot of what seemed like distant chatter in the background. I asked who was there, and for them to give me a name. A very skinny, older woman stepped out from one of the tunnels and sank to the ground as I was still laying on my back. I saw her finger moving around in the dirt and then step back into the tunnels. Curiously, I stood up, walked over to the writing in the dirt. I looked at the letters individually \"A\" \"N\" \"A\" \"S\" \"T\" \"Y\" \"A\". As I looked at the last letter I heard a chorus of voices coming from the tunnels say the word \"Anastya\". As soon as the word was finished it almost felt like I was thrown up the hole toward the sky and I was terrified as I jolted up.\n\nI swear to you, I have never heard of this word or name in my entire life, so there is absolutely no way this word was somehow at the back of my subconscious. A quick google search reveals surprisingly few results. The first of few searches came from \"https://m.name-doctor.com/anastya/\" and it read:\n\n\"This name derives from the Ancient Greek name \u201cAnastas\u00ed\u0101 \u200e(\u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u1fb1)\u201d, from \u201can\u00e1stasis \u200e(\u1fb0\u0313\u03bd\u1fb0\u0301\u03c3\u03c4\u1fb0\u03c3\u1fd0\u03c2)\u201d, meaning \u201cresurrection, rebirth\u201d, which in turn is composed of three elements: \u201cana- \u200e(\u1fb0\u0313\u03bd\u1fb0-)\u200e\u201d (up) plus \u201ch\u00edst\u0113mi (\u1fd0\u0314\u0301\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u1fd0)\u201d (I stand) plus \u201c-sis \u200e(-\u03c3\u1fd0\u03c2)\u201d (suffix to form abstract nouns or nouns of action). In turn, the name means \u201cresurrected\u201d.\"\n\nObviously the part that hit me the most was that it means \"resurrection, rebirth, resurrected\". I swear to you, I could not make this up as I've never heard of this name before in my life. I remember as soon as I jolted awake I felt tingly all over my body and a lingering feeling of fear sat in the pit of my stomach.

I ended up leaving at around 00:20 and took the trains and buses home since I lived in the city. I decided to play energy healing music that was in 432 Hz as I waited for the train to come. The blue line train came as per usual taking a couple of minutes and on time. I got off the the blue line train to then switch off to the orange line. Usually, I'd get off the next stop for the orange line train and just wait for the bus since I'd rather wait than to walk since I would usually feel tired. Unfortunately, the orange line train ended up taking until about 01:15 for it to arrive for some reason so I already missed the last bus to get home. I had to get off at a different station and walk all the way home instead. I got in the train and there was a piece of tape slapped onto the glass of the door with the name \"**Angelica**\". I felt like it could've been a sign but I know I am a person who can have the tendency to over-analyze so I tried not to let it get to me too much. I got off the station and I started to walk home. As I'm walking through the community college, I see a brochure off to the side in the open so I decided to walk towards it and look into it; it was a brochure on singing hymns in a church. I don't think too much on religion but I think it's great when people finds whatever their belief is right for them at the end of the day. I'm walking home just constantly having an intense mental battle on decision making on something as small as which sidewalk to walk on while I try to constantly remind myself to \"let go and trust your body to where it leads you\". Eventually I'm on my side of where I live (in the projects area), I looked up to my right and admired how beautiful the full moon was; I then kept on walking. I was thinking on whether I should take a left or head straight to go admire the ocean; straight ahead however, one the street lights were blinking profusely so my decision was made; I went straight ahead. I was walking to the area but I couldn't help but think of the moon instead; all I felt was my body telling me, \"Follow the moon. Follow the moon.\" I decided to go see the moon. I sat down on the bench and admired it's beauty. To it's left moving to the right were clouds. I admired the clouds as well and noticed something --- I saw someone's face yet there were no clouds in the mouth area with some indescribable energy of clouds surrounding this face. I didn't understand it but I certainly felt this kind of energy. It was a very heavy, powerful, and intense energy I felt that was connecting me deep in my soul --- I wanted to cry but I just couldn't since I was feeling so many different emotions at once. I didn't even want to take out my phone because I just felt that it was something that I just wanted to take in. Eventually the clouds faded away... I didn't want to leave but I had to just because I wanted to charge my phone momentarily and head back out again once I have it charged back up again. I arrived home. Took my headphones off and played the 432 Hz music on my computer instead. I decided to take my tarot deck out since there was a question that has been running through my mind over and over and I only wanted to draw one card. I closed my eyes and shuffled the deck even though I sensed that I was going to grab The Moon card. \"I'm not gonna do reversed cards this time.\" Feeling out the deck, there was a card that stood out so clearly in my hands that I knew it was the one for sure so then I asked my question --- \"**Who is Angelica?**\" I drew the card... **XVIII: The Moon** \\--- it was even right-side up to begin with too! I freaked out left a message on friends' Discord server about how I've been seeing signs and the tarot cards I pulled. After I sent that message, I decided to open up a tarot app named Galaxy Tarot.

It wasn't like actual hearing loss tho, it was like a pressure was being out to any sound surrounding it. Then noise started coming in again, through both ears this time. Except it was now just a buzzing that was little and started growing really loudly. It sounded similar to bugs when something like an eclipse happens. I thought it was maybe outside but everytime I moved, it stayed the same. Eventually it stopped and instead I saw two moons outside my window. \n\n\n\nThe regular moon was really bright and honestly, it looked more like someone put a sticker to the sky while there was another darker one right behind it. I even took a picture ( https://photos.app.goo.gl/uy3jqNKwJJZLEt3M8 ). The glaring one is the regular bright moon and the circle right next to it is the second moon.

So last night and really every night for the past week I have been sitting down and collecting my thoughts and really figuring out what I want to manifest. I have that chat with my spirit guides and trust in the process. Out of curiosity before I was about to fall asleep, I had asked my spirit guides to give me some sort of sign that i was on the right path. Then I thought that was silly because of course I am. So then I asked for them to manifest themselves in my dreams tonight so that I know I\u2019m truly connected. It was a late night for me. And lately has been burning that midnight oil and really diving deep into this. When no less than 3 minutes later I get a text message from a completely random phone number. You know one of those that is spam and if you click the link you \u201cwin\u201d something. Well the message said exactly \u201ctimebliss I came and \u201c and that was it. I was confused and then my attention immediately brought to the time and the time of the message. 3:33 am. Those are angel numbers if my research is correct. And I get what it means for the most part. It was my validation. Just don\u2019t know if the actual message from the text pertains to anything? Lmk what you think please.

It is a process which very few on your planet have completed in the past, although many have lived productive and loving lives.\n\nIt has been difficult to reach the high level of vibration required because of the atmosphere of heaviness, Darkness which has surrounded you. Even some who were named Saints after their deaths were not able to sustain the 5th dimensional vibration because of religious teachings, trauma or personal difficulty which caused them to lose their grip on the source of high vibration, which is Love and Joy.\n\nYes, it has been an impediment to ascension in the past when people believed that happiness and godliness do not mix. This has been a terrible travesty, because suffering and pain have been lauded, while cheerfulness and good will have been seen as a lack of serious commitment. What a shame this is. Laughter, song, dancing and play are a great part of the foundation for a strong connection to God. It has been a terrible development in religious practice, that self-flagellation, self-hatred and self-punishment are accepted as an appropriate means to elevating one's spirituality.\n\nI wish to make it very clear that punishment of any kind, including that which is directed toward the self, is completely inappropriate to any religious or spiritual practice which intends to lift one to a higher plane. These actions serve rather to lower one's vibration by creating pain, especially emotional pain. It must be the most serious consideration in working toward Ascension that each person examine their habit of self-judgment.\n\nSelf-judgment is not the same as evaluating your own behavior in order to improve or change. Judgment is an attitude of superiority, condemnation and prejudice. It is designed to create a feeling of triumph or power over another, even if that \"other\" is your own self. Thus, a division is created in the person - what you might call a split in the personality - in which the one who judges harshly and the one who is punished happen to inhabit the same body. Such is the power of the human imagination, that one can take a position of power over oneself.\n\nThis separation or division between the \"I\" and \"Me\" within one individual has come to be accepted as a normal, even advantageous way to motivate or improve oneself. This is not true. Just as punishment creates ill will and resentment, so does self-punishment. This tradition of applying Darkness to create Light is entirely destructive, a form of torture developed by those who wished to divide and control others. You cannot divide and control yourself; this is a direct route to the lower-vibe emotions, like sadness, despair, depression and anxiety. It prevents you from breaking free, and it prevents you from doing the healing you need to accomplish in order to ascend.\n\nNow, what is the way out of this conundrum? Understand that Our Love contains no judgment, no condemnation, no disapproval. In accepting the Love of God, you must also relinquish your attachment to disapproving judgment. Love yourself as I love you, and you will begin to smile. Allow the last of your tears to fall, cleansing the regret and pain you have accumulated over lifetimes of disapproval and belittlement, then dry your eyes and look around you. You will begin to see beauty, strength and intelligence in those around you - those who are like you and those who are different.\n\nGod does not look down upon those whose skin is a different color from yours, or those who are poor, those who are in a female body, or those who are practicing a religion that is different from yours. All are God's children, and all are equal in God's eyes. I see you as Mother/Father God do: I see brilliant souls at every level of development, all striving to learn, all wanting to evolve. None is more valuable than any other in our eyes; all are precious, all are divine.\n\nAll life in the Universe is sacred, and all life represents consciousness. Every planet is a Being, every animal, plant and insect are soul creations, an integral part of All That Is. The Kingdoms of the plants and animals are sacred participants in the whole that is under the protection and nurturance of Mother Earth, the great cosmic planet soul. It is not an esoteric or strange pagan practice we teach here - it is Truth. You have been separated from connection to the life around you, and it has added to your estrangement, your feelings of alienation and loneliness. Restore those connections and you will never again feel loneliness or despair.\n\nBegin with gratitude. Consider the goodness in life. Perhaps you have seen something beautiful in Nature; perhaps you have tasted Love in your life. Celebrate those moments, those precious experiences you hold in your memory. Look around you to search out beauty. A blade of grass holds wonder; a child's eyes reflect the depth of God's absolute Love. What is a disability or an affliction but a sacred trust? God trusted you to overcome, to learn something profound in the experience of living in a body which is different from the norm, or a mind that creates differently from others.\n\nThrow away your judgments: this is good, this is bad. Open your hearts to a new perspective - Our perspective, which is always colored by the deepest Love, and the deepest desire to see you grow. See yourself through Our eyes, and you will never again feel a moment of shame or disappointment in yourself. You are perfect, and you are learning.\n\nYou may see your past in the cruel light of self-judgment. This was a failure, that was a mistake. You may feel you are not \"successful\" in your life. Dear Ones, from our perspective, there is no such thing as an unsuccessful life, unless you spent every moment of it asleep, and even that would be an important lesson. As long as you are alive, as long as your have breath, you are on the threshold of a new revelation. Any moment, you are able to awaken and begin anew, in Love and Light. Now look back at the experiences of your life. See how each \"mistake,\" every disappointment led you to make a change in your path, or opened new possibilities for your growth.\n\nThere are no failures, Beloved Ones. There is only learning. From this perspective, the more failures you have experienced, the more likely you are to be preparing yourself for your ascension. The \"school of hard knocks\" which is life on Planet Earth has prepared you for one of two things - great empathy and compassion, or arrogant intolerance. Which will you choose? And which will you choose to apply to yourself?\n\nIn Truth, the most important principles to live by, and the fundamental requirement for Ascension are these:\n\nNo soul will reach the level of vibration needed to take part in the Ascension to the 5th dimension without a complete and absolute acceptance of themselves as Divine. This is the knowledge that we each are loved without exception. The acceptance of that Truth then becomes unending Love of the Self - what you have called Unconditional Love. In this acceptance, you become Light - the powerful beacon of Love which will lift you and others around you to higher levels of consciousness.\n\nAbsolute and unending Love of Self releases the Being from all experience of the emotions of shame, fear and judgment. This freedom unleashes the power of creativity, and the capacity to love others unconditionally, without judgment or fear. It is a complete joining with Source and the recognition of the Self as One with Creator, and with all consciousness.\n\nWe, the Trinity of Prime Creator, Mother/Father God and I, Sananda, hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all souls are created equal. We are the ones you have known as The Father (Prime Creator), the Son (myself) and the Holy Spirit (Mother/Father God).\n\nThese designations have in the past been limited to male identity, although each of us carries the wholeness of being both male and female in our Nature. I, Sananda, am the male expression of my Unity Being, which includes my feminine counterpart, or Twin Flame, who is Lady Nada. She accompanied me in body in my life as Jesus, as the one you knew as Mary Magdalene. Together we form one complete soul.\n\nMother and Father God are One, both male and female, the Creators of our galaxy, who together envisioned the planet you know as Earth. It was then birthed by Mother God as the expression of their Unified essence, which is Love. As in humankind, only the Mother has the abiity to give birth to new souls; she carries the gift of birth in her Being.\n\nPrime Creator is One, neither male nor female, the Beginning, the First Creator. Lady Nada and I are the soul child of Prime Creator, as are Mother and Father God. We were created to fulfill our missions in service to Love. Our essence is Love, and we have developed that Love over eons, as we learned the power of Creation under the watchful eye of our Maker.\n\nMother/Father God have fulfilled their destiny as the Creators of this galaxy, and they continue to evolve and expand as Beings of Light, as we all do. Every soul in the entire Cosmos is a part of the expanding breath of life, the inevitable flow which leads to constant change, constant evolution to higher levels of consciousness.\n\nPlanet Earth, the precious creation of Mother/Father God, fulfills her destiny as the Mother by being a part of the birth of all that which sustains life within and upon her body. The matter of which she is made is the source of life for all beings, including humankind. All beings who are birthed on her body carry both the essence of their Created Souls and the material essence of their bodies - the marriage of Spirit and form which creates life as you know it on Earth.\n\nThus, the bodies which you inhabit during your sojourn here on Earth are the vessels of your souls, the entities which have allowed you to experience life in the lower, denser atmosphere of the 3rd dimension. In times past, when you ended your lives as human beings, you would leave your body to return to Mother Earth, while your soul being made the transition to the 5th dimension.\n\nThis time it will be different for those who choose to ascend before the end of their present lifetime. You will transition to higher dimensions, but you will take your bodies with you, to be renewed and restored to perfect health, and you will be able to remain with those bodies if you wish to return to Earth.\n\nShould you accomplish the elevation to higher dimensions, your body can be left for safekeeping while you travel in your lightbody, the essence of your soul being. This will give you tremendous freedom, to experience life in a body, as you have done here during this lifetime, or to travel the cosmos as your disembodied consciousness, your soul essence. You will also be able to join with your Twin Flame, the other half of your Created Soul, as one. It is truly the spiritual version of what you would call \"a win-win situation.\"\n\nNow we are being summoned by Prime Creator, who wishes to contribute to this discussion by including a statement here.\n\n**Prime Creator** Speaks:\n\nIt is joy which brings me to communicate with you. It is a time of rebirth, of increasing vitality and change. The events you are experiencing now are the beginning of a new era for Planet Earth, and it also heralds in a shift across All That Is to a higher vibration. All beings in the Multiverse - the Universes within and beyond your human perception - are taking part in the rising tide which lifts all to higher levels of existence. Indeed, every being in every corner of the Universe will feel the effects of this great rebirth.\n\nIt is my intention that all be given the freedom to grow, to ascend to higher dimensions. It is the birthright of all beings, this natural movement toward expansion. It is felt everywhere as individuals and as groups, although many areas of the cosmos have already evolved to an experience of life which is lived as a group identity, a shared consciousness. It is the evolution of Love to join with others in harmony and bliss. It is your destiny to make this transition as well, although that is still a long way off for humankind. Your experience as individuals - your individuation phase - has been a productive learning experience, one which will bring great richness and depth to your eventual joining in Unity.\n\nFor you, behind the Veil of Forgetfulness which shields you from knowledge of those higher dimensions you have experienced as Home between incarnations, it is not apparent that there are worlds beyond worlds for you to explore. It has appeared to you that all existence is what you see and feel with your present bodies, through the use of your five senses. This was part of the Great Experiment, of course. It allowed you to experience free will. Were you to have complete vision as you do in higher dimensions, you would not be able to make completely independent choices, for higher dimensional Vision allows you to see cause and effect, removing the mystery of where a particular decision will lead you.\n\nThus, in the condition of 3-dimensional Earth, you were given the option to direct your life in response to your experience of mental, emotional, physical and spiritual bodies. The added element of physicality, combined with free will, has created a superior learning environment, with the opportunity to choose connection with me and with other beings in spirit form, or to live apart from the Love and support of the Heavenly Host. Those who have maintained this connection or are awakening to it will find their path cleared for them. By joining with the power of Love, you are able to take flight.\n\nAs each one awakens to the possibility of accomplishing this wondrous transition together, you will have need of teachers, mentors and guides to help you take this leap into what you might think of as the unknown. Your guides will have already pierced the Veil and will be aware of the glories which await you. You will receive all the help you need, for as long as you need it. This is also part of the plan.\n\nMany among you are incarnated Ascended Masters who have come to assist you. They too have had to make the effort to awaken from the oppression and Darkness which has weighed upon all of you. They have lived many lives in preparation for this time, where they gained in wisdom and strength, and they are now working to clear away all residue of distortion and suffering from this and past lifetimes, so that they may lead you from a position of Absolute Love.\n\nDuring each phase of growth as it is expressed in the process of Ascension, there are souls who step forward to lead others toward the Light. On your planet at this time, the Kumaras, whose growth as souls was accomplished over eons on the Planet Venus, have played an important role. They are the family of Sananda which has taken a special interest in this Ascension, and they are all the children of my heart.\n\nOver eons, they have evolved to their position of influence by virtue of their level of learning and their achievement of higher dimensional understanding. They are among the Enlightened Beings who serve in positions of responsibility on your planet and in the High Councils of the Galactic Federation and beyond. It is the custom for these Enlightened Beings to serve as Regents of Planet Earth - those leaders who take responsibility for the growth and development of all beings on the planet.\n\nThe Regents, who are also known as Lords of the World, serve for a period of some 2,000 years as measured in Earth time. The Regents who have been chosen by a Council of beings from this planet and beyond to serve at this time of transition are the ones you know as Lord St. Germain and Lady Portia. They take over the duties from the past Regents, Lord Sanat Kumara and Lady Venus. As some of you may know, in his recent Earthly incarnation, Sanat Kumara trained Kathryn over a period of 30 years in the ancient technique of Visual Centering, to prepare her for this work she is doing now. Of course, neither of them knew of that at the time. They only knew they felt a very strong bond, and loved each other very much.\n\nTheir special interest and commitment to the cause of Love and Light has been recognized for eons, and their love of Mother Earth and humankind is unwavering. In preparation for this responsibility, they have each lived lives as leaders of the people. St. Germain is known for his incarnations as alchemist, writer and political leader, while Lady Portia has served in powerful political positions as queen in various eras in several countries during your history. Together and separately they have helped to shape the fertile arena which is now your springboard to Ascension.\n\nOur channel, Kathryn, is not comfortable with being both the subject and the scribe for these discussions, but we can assure her this is not the only source of information on this topic. We also wish to reassure others who sincerely believe they have been given the responsibility of presenting the presence of Lady Portia in body at this time, you are indeed an aspect of Lady Portia, and your Twin Flame is an aspect of St. Germain, and you are offering a great service by disseminating the wonderful teachings of these Masters.\n\nIt is time now on Planet Earth for all of you to begin diligently applying the lessons you have been given here, in Sananda's teachings, and in the many messages from Mother/Father God which are all gathered on the website, [www.whoneedslight.org](https://www.whoneedslight.org/).\n\nThis is the original source of our teachings, which were first written in English.\n\nTranslations have been made in many languages, and the messages may be copied without charge, but the originals should always be considered the authentic source.\n\nWe are giving you everything we can offer you in writing, and our Masters are teaching our True Way across the globe, but it is up to you to read with an open heart, to be willing to change the ideas you have come to believe as a result of your religious teachings, and above all, to raise your vibrations so that you will be prepared to ascend when the portals become visible to you. It is entirely your choice and your responsibility to prepare yourselves, as our Ascended Masters have done in the past. We are sending waves of healing energy to you now, to help you wash away old feelings, old convictions and old pain so that you can experience yourselves as the brilliant beings of Love you were born to be.\n\nLet me give you one last definitive explanation of what is required for your personal ascension:\n\n1). You must maintain complete command over your emotions, thoughts and feelings, such that you only permit expression of the high vibration emotions, which are Love, Compassion, Kindness, Forgiveness, Joy, Laughter, Harmony and Peace.\n\n2). Gain command over your thoughts so that you refuse entrance to those thoughts and ideas which cause you doubt, anger, resentment, anxiety or despair, or which bring these feelings to others. Do not insist that you are simply addressing \"reality.\" These thoughts are all manifestations of Darkness, the Dark teachings of the past.\n\n3.) Understand that self-defense is only that. Initiating an attack on another, regardless of the professed excuse, is never acceptable to God.\n\n4). Remain in a state of good will, kindness and compassion toward yourself and your fellow humans at all times. Any religion or attitude which professes enmity, disapproval or condemnation toward others is false and not of this Creator.\n\n5). Accept that you, and all the animal, vegetable and mineral creations on your Planet Earth are conscious beings with feelings, thoughts and aspirations to ascend. Refrain from eating the animals, for they are your friends. You will all rise together, and you will receive great assistance from the other Kingdoms.\n\n6). Protect your planet as you would your child, for she is the source of Life. Do not permit invasion and attack to her body, regardless of any excuse that is given or any entitlement assumed.\n\n7). Join with others, especially including the children, to joyfully and consciously prepare yourselves for this all-important event. Nothing in your lives is as important or as deserving of your attention as assuring your own Ascension and that of the people around you.\n\n8). Allow the endless Love from Us to flow through your body and fill your heart. In this way, you allow your own ascension to occur effortlessly.\n\n9). Teach patience, compassion and endless Love through your own actions, which speak louder than anything you can say. Make peace with those around you, and you will live in peace.\n\n10). Approach this challenge with Joy, for it is truly the stairway to Heaven.\n\nThese are my Commandments and the desire of my Heart, to see every one of my Earth children ascend in Joy, as all fulfill the destiny of humankind, to live in peace and harmony in the 5th dimension. They are Universal Laws, and living by these Laws will bring unfathomable happiness and fulfillment to every being on Earth and in the Heavens.\n\nI give you my Love, my trust in your innate Nature, and the assistance of my trusted Masters to help ease your way. May your days be filled with Laughter and Joy.\n\nI AM your Prime Creator.  \n\n\nChanneled by *Kathryn E.

On the contrary I simply am too fragile; so easily prone to the fraction of spirit, mind, and body. I prefer to bear with the vulnerability I feel in my bones than to suffer a translation of my passions, longings, and heartaches.\n\n\nI believe any attempt to nail reality to my little wall of consciousness is a kind of injustice that I'm not interested in knowingly acting out.

A dignity baked distinctly for the reluctant space in their own stomach that resounds with hunger. An understanding that is only as valuable as the unraveling of that knot between your breath and theirs.

And when others aren't around one simply cooks.

Yesterday's Speech, O Asclepius, I dedicated to thee, this day's it is fit to dedicate to Tat, because it is\n\nan Epitome of those general speeches that were spoken to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. God therefore, and the Father, and the Good, O Tat, have the same Nature, or rather also the same\n\nAct and Operation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. For there is one name or appellation of Nature and Increase which concerneth things changeable, and\n\nanother about things unchangeable, and about things unmoveable, that is to say, Things Divine and\n\nHuman; every one of which, himself will have so to be; but action or operation is of another thing, or\n\nelsewhere, as we have taught in other things, Divine and Human, which must here also be understood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. For his Operation or Act, is his Will, and his Essence, to Will all Things to be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. For what is God, and the Father, and the Good, but the Being of all things that yet are not, and the\n\nexistence itself, of those things that are!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6. This is God, this is the Father, this is the Good, whereunto no other thing is present or approacheth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7. For the World, and the Sun, which is also a Father by Participation, is not for all that equally the cause\n\nof Good, and of Life, to living Creatures: And if this be so, he is altogether constrained by the Will of the\n\nGood, without which it is not possible, either to be, or to be begotten or made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8. But the Father is the cause of his Children, who hath a will both to sow and nourish that which is good\n\nby the Son.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9. For Good is always active or busy in making; and this cannot be in any other, but in him that taketh\n\nnothing, and yet willeth all things to be; for I will not say, O Tat, making them; for he that maketh is\n\ndefective in much time, in which sometimes he maketh not, as also of quantity and quality; for sometimes\n\nhe maketh those things that have quantity and quality and sometimes the contrary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10. But God is the Father, and the Good, in being all things; for he both will be this, and is it, and yet all\n\nthis for himself (as is true) in him that can see it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n11. For all things else are for this, it is the property of Good to be known: This is the Good, O Tat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n12. Tat. Thou hast filled us, O Father, with a sight both good and fair, and the eye of my mind is almost\n\nbecome more holy by the sight or spectacle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n13. Trismegistus. I Wonder not at It, for the Sight of Good is not like the Beam of the Sun, which being of\n\na fiery shining brightness, maketh the eye blind by his excessive Light, that gazeth upon it; rather the\n\ncontrary, for it enlighteneth, and so much increaseth the light of the eye, as any man is able to receive\n\nthe influence of this Intelligible clearness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n14. For it is more swift and sharp to pierce, and innocent or harmless withal, and full of immortality, and\n\nthey that are capable and can draw any store of this spectacle, and sight do many times fall asleep from\n\nthe Body, into this most fair and beauteous Vision ; which thing Celius and Saturn our Progenitors\n\nobtained unto.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n15. Tat. I would we also, O Father, could do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n16. Trismegistus. I would have, could, O Son; but for the present we are less intent to the Vision, and\n\ncannot yet open the eyes of our minds to behold the incorruptible, and incomprehensible Beauty of that\n\nGood: But then shall we see it, when we have nothing at all to say of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n17. For the knowledge of it, is a Divine Silence, and the rest of all the Senses; For neither can he that\n\nunderstands that understand anything else, nor he that sees that, see any thing else, nor hear any other\n\nthing, nor in sum, move the Body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n18. For shining steadfastly upon, and round about the whole Mind it enlighteneth all the Soul ; and\n\nloosing it from the Bodily Senses and Motions, it draweth it from the Body, and changeth it wholly into the\n\nEssence of God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n19. For it is Possible for the Soul, O Son, to be Deified while yet it Lodgeth in the Body of Man, if it\n\nContemplate the Beauty of the Good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n20. Tat. How dost thou mean deifying, Father!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n21. Trismegistus. There are differences, O Son, of every Soul.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n22. Tat. But how dost thou again divide the changes?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n23. Trismegistus. Hast thou not heard in the general Speeches, that from one Soul of the Universe, are\n\nall those Souls, which in all the world are tossed up and down, as it were, and severally divided? Of\n\nthese Souls there are many changes, some into a more fortunate estate, and some quite contrary; for they which are of creeping things, are changed into those of watery things and those of things living in\n\nthe water, to those of things living upon the Land; and Airy ones are changed into men, and human\n\nSouls, that lay hold of immortality, are changed into Demons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n24. And so they go on into the Sphere or Region of the fixed Gods, for there are two choirs or companies\n\nof Gods, one of them that wander, and another of them that are fixed. And this is the most perfect glory of\n\nthe Soul.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n25. But the Soul entering into the Body of a Man, if it continue evil, shall neither taste of immortality, nor is\n\npartaker of the good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n26. But being drawn back the same way, it returneth into creeping things. And this is the condemnation of\n\nan evil Soul.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n27. And the wickedness of a Soul is ignorance; for the Soul that knows nothing of the things that are,\n\nneither the Nature of them, nor that which is good, but is blinded, rusheth and dasheth against the bodily\n\nPassions, and unhappy as it is, not knowing itself, it serveth strange Bodies, and evil ones, carrying the\n\nBody as a burden, and not ruling, but ruled. And this is the mischief of the Soul.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n28. On the contrary, the virtue of the Soul is Knowledge; for he that knows is both good and religious, and\n\nalready Divine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n29. Tat. But who is such a one, O Father!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n30. Trismegistus. He that neither speaks, nor hears many things; for he, O Son, that heareth two\n\nspeeches or hearings, fighteth in the shadow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n31. For God, and the Father, and Good, is neither spoken nor heard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n32. This being so in all things that are, are the Senses, because they cannot be without them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n33. But Knowledge differs much from Sense; for Sense is of things that surmount it, but Knowledge is the\n\nend of Sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n34. Knowledge is the gift of God ; for all Knowledge is unbodily but uses the Mind as an Instrument, as the Mind uses the Body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n35. Therefore both intelligible and material things go both of them into bodies; for, of contraposition, That\n\nis Setting One against Another, and Contrariety, all Things must Consist. And it is impossible it should be otherwise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n36. Tat. who therefore is this material God?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n37. Trismegistus. The fair and beautiful world, and yet it is not good; for it is material and easily passible,\n\nnay, it is the first of all passible things; and the second of the things that are, and needy or wanting\n\nsomewhat else. And it was once made and is always, and is ever in generation, and made, and\n\ncontinually makes, or generates things that have quantity and quality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n38. For it is moveable, and every material motion is generation; but the intellectual stability moves the\n\nmaterial motion after this manner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n39. Because the World Is a Sphere, that is a Head, and above the head there is nothing material, as\n\nbeneath the feet there is nothing intellectual.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n40. The whole universe is material; The Mind is the head, and it is moved spherically, that is like a head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n41. Whatsoever therefore is joined or united to the Membrane or Film of this head, wherein the Soul is, is\n\nimmortal, and as in the Soul of a made Body, hath its Soul full of the Body; but those that are further from\n\nthat Membrane, have the Body full of Soul.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n42. The whole is a living wight \\[a creature\\], and therefore consisteth of material and intellectual.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n43. And the World is the first, and Man the second living wight \\[a creature\\] after the World; but the first of\n\nthings that are mortal and therefore hath whatsoever benefit of the Soul all the others have: And yet for\n\nall this, he is not only not good, but flatly evil, as being mortal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n44. For the World is not good as it is moveable; nor evil as it is immortal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n45. But man is evil, both as he is moveable, and as he is mortal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n46. But the Soul of Man is carried in this manner, The Mind is in Reason, Reason in the Soul, the Soul in\n\nthe Spirit, the Spirit in the Body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n47. The Spirit being diffused and going through the veins, and arteries, and blood, both moveth the living\n\nCreature, and after a certain manner beareth it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n48. Wherefore some also have thought the Soul to be blood, being deceived in Nature, not knowing that first the Spirit must return into the Soul, and then the blood is congealed, the veins and arteries emptied,\n\nand then the living thing dieth: And this is the death of the Body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n49. All things depend of one beginning, and the beginning depends of that which is one and alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n50. And the beginning is moved, that it may again be a beginning; but that which is one, standeth and\n\nabideth, and is not moved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n51. There are therefore these three, God the Father, and the Good, the World and Man: God hath the\n\nWorld, and the World hath Man; and the World is the Son of God, and Man as it were the Offspring of the\n\nWorld.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n52. For God is not ignorant of man, but knows him perfectly, and will be known by him. This only is\n\nhealthful to man; the Knowledge of God: this is the return of Olympus; by this only the Soul is made\n\ngood, and not sometimes good, and sometimes evil, but of necessity Good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n53. Tat. What meanest thou, O Father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n54. Trismegistus. Consider, O Son, the Soul of a Child, when as yet it hath received no dissolution of its\n\nBody, which is not yet grown, but is very small; how then if it look upon itself, it sees itself beautiful, as not\n\nhaving been yet spotted with the Passions of the Body, but as it were depending yet upon the Soul of the\n\nWorld.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n55. But when the Body is grown and distracteth, the Soul it engenders Forgetfulness, and partakes no\n\nmore of the Fair and the Good, and Forgetfulness is Evilness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n56. The like also happeneth to them that go out of the Body, for when the Soul runs back into itself the\n\nSpirit is contracted into the blood and the Soul into the Spirit; but the Mind being made pure, and free\n\nfrom these clothings; and being Divine by Nature, taking a fiery Body rangeth abroad in every place,\n\nleaving the Soul to judgment, and to the punishment it hath deserved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n57. Tat. Why dost thou say so, O Father, that the Mind is separated from the Soul, and the Soul from the\n\nSpirit? When even now thou sayest the Soul was the Clothing or Apparel of the Mind, and the Body of\n\nthe Soul.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n58. Trismegistus. O Son, he that hears must co-understand and conspire in thought with him that speaks;\n\nyea, he must have his hearing swifter and sharper than the voice of the speaker.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n59. The disposition of these Clothings or Covers, is done in an Earthly Body; for it is impossible, that the mind should establish or rest itself, naked, and of itself; in an Earthly Body; neither is the Earthly Body\n\nable to bear such immortality; and therefore that it might suffer so great virtue the Mind compacted as it\n\nwere, and took to itself the passible Body of the Soul, as a Covering or Clothing. And the Soul being also\n\nin some sort Divine, useth the Spirit as her Minister and Servant, and the Spirit governeth the living thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n60. When therefore the Mind is separated, and departeth from the earthly Body, presently it puts on its\n\nFiery Coat, which it could not do having to dwell in an Earthly Body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n61. For the Earth cannot suffer fire, for it is all burned of a small spark; therefore is the water poured\n\nround about the Earth, as a Wall or defence, to withstand the flame of fire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n62. But the Mind being the most sharp or swift of all the Divine Cogitations, and more swift than all the\n\nElements, hath the fire for its Body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n63. For the Mind which is the Workman of all useth the fire as his instrument in his Workmanship; and he\n\nthat is the Workman of all, used it to the making of all things, as it is used by man, to the making of\n\nEarthly things only; for the Mind that is upon Earth, void, or naked of fire, cannot do the business of men.\n\nnor that which is otherwise the affairs of God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n64. But the Soul of Man, and yet not everyone, but that which is pious and religious, is Angelical and\n\nDivine. And such a Soul, after it is departed from the Body, having striven the strife of Piety, becomes\n\neither Mind or God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n65. And the strife of Piety is to know God, and to injure no Man, and this way it becomes Mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n66. But an impious Soul abideth in its own essence, punished of itself, and seeking an earthly and human\n\nBody to enter into.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n67. For no other Body is capable of a Human Soul, neither is it lawful for a Man's Soul to fall into the\n\nBody of an unreasonable living thing: For it is the Law or Decree of God, to preserve a Human Soul from\n\nso great a contumely and reproach.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n68. Tat. How then is the Soul of Man punished, O Father; and what is its greatest torment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n69. Hermes. Impiety, O my Son; for what Fire hath so great a flame as it? Or what biting Beast doth so\n\ntear the Body as it doth the Soul.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n70. Or dost thou not see how many evils the wicked Soul suffereth, roaring and crying out, I am Burned, I\n\nam Consumed, I know not what to Say, or Do, I am Devoured, Unhappy Wretch, of the Evils that compass and lay-hold upon me; Miserable that I am, I neither See nor Hear anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n71. These are the voices of a punished and tormented Soul, and not as many; and thou, O Son, thinkest\n\nthat the Soul going out of the Body grows brutish or enters into a Beast: which is a very great Error, for\n\nthe Soul punished after this manner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n72. For the Mind, when it is ordered or appointed to get a fiery Body for the services of God, coming\n\ndown into the wicked Soul, torments it with the whips of Sins, wherewith the wicked Soul being scourged,\n\nturns itself to Murders, and Contumelies, and Blasphemies, and divers Violences, and other things by\n\nwhich men are injured\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n73. But into a pious Soul, the Mind entering, leads it into the Light of Knowledge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n74. And such a Soul is never satisfied with singing praise to God, and speaking well of all men; and both\n\nin words and deeds, always doing good in imitation of her Father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n75. Therefore, O Son, we must give thanks, and pray, that we may obtain a good mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n76. The Soul therefore may be altered or changed into the better, but into the worse it is impossible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n77. But there is a communion of Souls, and those of Gods, communicate with those of men; and those of\n\nmen, with those of Beasts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n78. And the better always take of the worse, Gods of Men, Men of brute Beasts, but God of all: For he is\n\nthe best of all, and all things are less than he.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n79. Therefore is the World subject unto God, Man unto the World and unreasonable things to Man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n80. But God is above all, and about all; and the beams of God are operations; and the beams of the\n\nWorld are Natures; and the beams of Man are Arts and Sciences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n81. And Operations do act by the World, and upon man by the natural beams of the World, but Natures\n\nwork by the Elements, and man by Arts and Sciences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n82. And this is the Government of the whole, depending upon the Nature of the One, and piercing or\n\ncoming down by the One Mind, than which nothing is more Divine, and more efficacious or operative;\n\nand nothing more uniting, or nothing is more One. The Communion of Gods to Men, and of Men to God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n83. This is the Bonus Genius, or good Demon, blessed Soul that is fullest of it! and unhappy Soul that is\n\nempty of it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n84. Tat. And wherefore Father?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n85. Trismegistus. Know Son, that every Soul hath the Good Mind; for of that it is we now speak, and not\n\nof that Minister of which we said before, That he was sent from the Judgment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n86. For the Soul without the Mind, can neither do, nor say any thing; for many times the Mind flies away\n\nfrom the Soul, and in that hour the Soul neither seeth nor heareth, but is like an unreasonable thing; so\n\ngreat is the power of the Mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n87. But neither brooketh it an idle or lazy Soul, but leaves such a one fastened to the Body, and by it\n\npressed down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n88. And such a Soul, O Son, hath no mind, wherefore neither must such a one be called a Man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n89. For man is a Divine living thing and is not to be compared to any brute Beast that lives upon Earth,\n\nbut to them that are above in Heaven, that are called Gods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n90. Rather, if we shall be bold to speak the truth, he that is a man indeed, is above them, or at least they\n\nare equal in power, one to the other, For none of the things in Heaven will come down upon Earth, and\n\nleave the limits of Heaven, but a man ascends up into Heaven, and measures it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n91. And he knoweth what things are on high, and what below, and learneth all other things exactly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n92. And that which is the greatest of all, he leaveth not the Earth, and yet is above: So great is the\n\ngreatness of his Nature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n93. Wherefore we must be bold to say, That an Earthly Man is a Mortal God, and That the Heavenly God\n\nis an Immortal Man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n94. Wherefore, by these two are all things governed, the World and Man; but they and all things else, of\n\nthat which is One.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 57085, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Fourth Fragmentary Book of Hermes Mercurius Trismegistus called \"The Key\"", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568489050, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d3u7s6/the_fourth_fragmentary_book_of_hermes_mercurius/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Thedivineplan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4gmhc1bw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568400644, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d3tqzo/september_13_2019_message_from_your_divine/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d3tqzo", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Channeling"}], "link_flair_template_id": "fa02bd38-8418-11e7-839e-0ecd58f017ce", "link_flair_text": "Channeling", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d3tqzo/september_13_2019_message_from_your_divine/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "e_APW-pIjzKHNiAyQVBy8G8YoOdtPNPEpnr6DyilItc", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/fPN24Ll7M1cQSWJ_Ymh_hp5Sn_wED_YgORXFzqMxn2Q.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f44888b0cf0787927a521cb20cc0bf3d517e4f40", "width": 108}], "source": {"height": 150, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/fPN24Ll7M1cQSWJ_Ymh_hp5Sn_wED_YgORXFzqMxn2Q.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=e0934ba20c378af00335f0e93a5b9750658fd4a5", "width": 150}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1568400647, "score": 1, "selftext": "Are you feeling this?\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd2e I am in the process of creating and editing oracle cards to help you on your twinflame, divine love journey.\n\nThe photo for today's message and for help and guidance on your journey including personal in depth readings, follow me on www.instagram.com/the.divine.plan \n\nHave a Beautiful and Blessed day \nLove,\nLuann", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 57084, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "September 13 2019~ Message from your Divine Counterpart's higher self \"I hold you during the night\"", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568487037, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d3tqzo/september_13_2019_message_from_your_divine/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ditnu1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3z7ngi8p", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568399820, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d3tk5o/what_does_it_mean_to_be_spiritually_awakened/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d3tk5o", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d3tk5o/what_does_it_mean_to_be_spiritually_awakened/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568399821, "score": 5, "selftext": "Hi there\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night I was in a free satsang held in my local town, run by some American guy I'd never heard of.

Where the mind couldn\u2019t process, all of your senses were working overtime. Love filled your heart and curiosity consumed you.\n\nThen it began. Life took hold, and with every breath, a new word, a new idea, and a new perception were thrusted into your mind. They weren\u2019t your own, but you digested them as best you could. The teachers played their roles, parents followed what they were taught, the radios buzzed with noise, and televisions blasted you with imagery to fill your databank.\n\nBefore long, you were doing as told, obeying the rules, staying on everyone else\u2019s schedule, and studying what you were told to learn. By the time you began forming deep thoughts of your own, you had been stripped of your senses, primarily your sixth sense. That connection experienced as a baby was a distant memory. You were now part of the system, the indoctrination, the inevitable slide of hand, being groomed by those who weren\u2019t the wiser.\n\nOne day, your mind was swirling with endless ideas about the world, and you dared to discuss it in school, or maybe at home. But you were quickly brushed off because these very ideas did not align with what others had been taught and instructed to teach. How could they respond or discuss that which they themselves could not comprehend or even begin to entertain? So, you stuffed it away and became more disconnected.\n\nPerhaps you lived through the hippie era, only to find that this free-spirited vibe was being stomped out by those who wanted to keep these secrets sacred and to themselves? They created the legend of drugs and freeloaders to remove the shine from the free spirits trying to promote peace and find their way back to the lost connection. Not that drugs weren\u2019t used of course. Or maybe you were making your way through the \u201cnew age\u201d movement, such as they liked to call it. Their way of assigning labels, to box up everyone as crackerjacks, and once again shun spirituality and the deeper connection. They even groomed and constructed gurus, so with each movement, more followers could be deemed as crackerjacks.\n\nThe Yogis had their calling as well. Yoga studios were popping up on every corner and people were buying up packaged classes faster than they could hire instructors. Soon, it too became the talk of \u201cultra-spiritual\u201d people going overboard with their spirituality, thinking they were all \u201cZen,\u201d just to discount another movement. The crystal bowl meditations quickly made their rounds, and off to tinfoil hats again. Always trying to stomp out the bliss.\n\nAgain and again they infiltrated and created movements to control a twisted narrative that would steer people away from this connection \u2013 this profound inner/outer connection. They were certain to leave those pages blank throughout your years of education. And while they had everyone idolizing gurus, actors, musicians, and so-called famous people, they drew you further and further away from yourself, while telling you how to think, what to believe, and how to be.\n\nWere you one of the lucky ones? Were you a child that remained so strongly connected that all of your senses broke through all bounds, you saw through clear lenses, and you felt everything? Everything. Did you catch the illusions? Did you hear the words coming out of mouths while hearing the real truths masked by the words? Did you feel their souls contradict their minds? Did you see the energy in all things as it vibrated its way through discourse? Could you touch their heart without physically moving? Did you ride the waves of light through time and space wondering how this veil, so thin, is so disguised to many? Did you wonder why those around you seemed so disoriented, disheartened, and disconnected? Did you wish you could escape the veil of transparency, or did you wish you could ride that wave forever?\n\nThere is resonance in vibration \u2013 truth engrained in all forms \u2013 powerful light within all beings. Those that knowingly and unknowingly stole that from you, are not the enemy. The enemy is yourself. For those who continue to deny that which is in every living vessel, to shun it, to shake it, to refuse to acknowledge it \u2013 you are hiding from your own shadow. For some, this connection is frightening, because it has been buried for so long, it\u2019s like welcoming a stranger into your most intimate existence. For others, it is the fear of waking up. Just as those who find it difficult to wake up from the illusions and falsehoods presented on this earth plane, they find it more difficult to wake up to the intangible plane that their soul longs for.\n\nYet, here you are. You are waking up to the realities, the illusions, the falsehoods and lies, while trying to discern what is truth, what to shed, and what to seek. And in this very moment, you can make the choice to greet your soul with a recognition, a faith, a belief, that you are an all-powerful being, connected to the light that carries with it a vibration that can offer you the comfort you seek, with undeniable discernment, compassion, and intuition that will provide you with clear lenses moving forward. A connection to a higher consciousness that cannot be unseen, unfelt, or turned off, once that reconnection is made.\n\nYou have been lied to. There is another world that exists. Strip away all the labels, the \u201cmovements,\u201d the gurus, and the naysayers \u2013 YOU are the other world. Each and every one of you. And it\u2019s a glorious world \u2013 a world where all of your innate, God-given higher consciousness exists. It was with you, in you, a part of you all along.\n\nWelcome home.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 57072, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "You Were Lied To \u2013 You Do Exist", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568478597, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d3rryu/you_were_lied_to_you_do_exist/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Magicite-", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_s8wow", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568388778, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d3qyan/the_sense_of_wrongness/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d3qyan", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d3qyan/the_sense_of_wrongness/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568388779, "score": 3, "selftext": "I was journaling today and had a bit of a self discovery moment.

spirituality again and found myself hooked up all night, i turned off my pc, started meditating, and grabbed my Thoth tarot deck (haven\u2019t used it in a while) i found myself crying of happiness with the beautiful answers I\u2019ve received from my own reading, i was almost in shock at how accurate they were, gave me answers about my present, past, and future, and i definitely want to live this life.\n\nToday i feel powerful, creative, productive, and happy to be alive.\n I\u2019ll never let myself be that miserable ever again, i don\u2019t deserve it, i know its not that easy,

Know that you are the perfect, shining light which not only makes the existence of God's kingdom possible, but also allow it to be seen as some wonderful heaven.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeart, the source, is the beginning, the middle and the end of all. Heart, the supreme space, is never a form. It is the light of truth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is perhaps more proper to say that the Self is the Heart itself than to say that it is in the Heart. Really, the Self is the centre itself. It is everywhere, aware of itself as \\`Heart', the Self-awareness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce you accept that from the true and absolute standpoint, the Heart as pure consciousness is beyond space and time, it will be easy for you to understand the rest in its correct perspective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo all deep thinking minds, the enquiry about the\n\n\u2018I\u2019 and its nature has an irresistible fascination.\n\nCall it by any name, God, Self, the heart or the seat\n\nof Consciousness, it is all the same. The point to be\n\ngrasped is this, that Heart means the very core of\n\none\u2019s being, the Centre, without which there is\n\nnothing whatever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat in which all these worlds seem to exist steadily, that of which all these worlds are a possession, that from which all these worlds rise, that for which all these exist, that by which all these worlds come into existence and that which is indeed all these - that alone is the existing reality. Let us cherish that Self, which is the reality, in the Heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe light that shines above the heavens and above this world, the light that shines in the highest world, beyond which there are no others - that is the light that shines in the hearts of men. \\~Upanishads\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne's own reality, which shines within everyone as the Heart, is itself the ocean of unalloyed bliss. Therefore like the unreal blueness of the sky, misery does not exist in reality but only in mere imagination. Since one's own reality, which is the sun of jnana that cannot be approached by the dark delusion of ignorance, itself shines as happiness, misery is nothing but an illusion caused by the unreal sense of individuality. In truth no one has ever experienced any such thing other than that unreal illusion. If one scrutinises one's own Self, which is bliss, there will be no misery at all in one's life. One suffers because of the idea that the body, which is never oneself, is \\`I'; suffering is all due to this delusion.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 57052, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "HEART (Quotes/Verses)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568464631, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d3omq2/heart_quotesverses/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Shaolin_Ghoul", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_43f4cv8c", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568377893, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d3ok6l/words_words_words/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d3ok6l", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General"}], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d3ok6l/words_words_words/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568377894, "score": 106, "selftext": "We\u2019re almost never looking at reality. \n\nA guru was once attempting to explain to a crowd how human beings react to words, feed on words, live on words, rather than on reality. \n\nOne of the men stood up and protested; he said, \u201cI don\u2019t agree that words have all that much effect on us.\u201d \n\nThe guru said, \u201csit down, you son of a b!tch.\u201d \n\nThe man went livid with rage and said, \u201cyou calm yourself an enlightened person, a guru, a master, but you ought to be ashamed of yourself.\u201d \n\nThe guru then said, \u201cpardon me, sir, I was carried away.

And this \"person\" kept taking me around to these cubicles, introducing me to the \"people\" there. The thing about these people, were the fact that they were, what I can basically describe as, super heroes. But it was extremely odd, as many of these \"people\" started to look the same again, and even weirder, was the fact that they looked like (what I can best describe as) a video game animation that's constantly looping. \n\nWell, at some point half way, I was outside with a bunch of other people during a solar eclipse? And everyone kept shouting not to look at the sun (good advice), but I kept looking at it too much, and basically the sky went from day to night in seconds, to which I noticed that the planet Jupiter was poking through the clouds.\n\nNow, for clarification, throughout this whole dream experience, I kept feeling like I was experiencing something that \"mortal\" people weren't meant to see, and right at that moment is when it REALLY hit me that I was starting to experience things that (potentially) certain beings didn't want me to see. Because at some point the dream snapped back to the office, and... well\n\nAll the \"super hero clones\" as I'll label it, were basically trying to kill me, as it felt almost like they were \"stabbing\" me, but the best way I can describe the stabbing feeling, wasn't exactly a physical feeling, but what best I can describe as the emotional feeling that (I think) comes with being stabbed. And this kept happening over and over, until I woke up\n\nAnd... my heart was beginning to beat way too fast. (for context I have Diabetes) At first I thought my blood sugar had dropped really low, but after checking my continuous glucose monitor, it looked ok (although it had lowered a bit more than usual over the night), so I double checked with testing blood from my finger, and all the while I was leading up to it, my heart palpitations got REALLY bad, to the point that I was starting to feel pretty dizzy and maybe close to fainting. But after seeing that my blood sugar was fine, as to make sure my continuous glucose monitor wasn't just slow to updating it being really low, but it had actually been fine.\n\nLuckily right after seeing that it was ok, my heart IMMEDIATELY went from beating ridiculously freaking fast, it calmed down just like that. Even now almost an hour later my heart still feels a bit strange after what I experienced.\n\nSo if anybody has any insight, please sure it with me, I'll reply as quickly as I can.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 57035, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I need some helpful guidance as to what I just experienced", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568454908, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d3mxqy/i_need_some_helpful_guidance_as_to_what_i_just/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "saiglai", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_nm95j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568368481, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d3mxjd/is_there_people_with_skill_to_do_distant_reading/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d3mxjd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d3mxjd/is_there_people_with_skill_to_do_distant_reading/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568368482, "score": 0, "selftext": "So is there spiritual masters who you can contact and they can do reading for you at distance?

Hope you are all well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple years ago I moved out of my parents' house and went to university. I'd always been a melancholy and angsty teenager, but after moving out and having to look after myself, I discovered that I had been bottling up a lot of things. I think being able to drown it out with video games, never having to cook, etc. etc. allowed me to ignore it and not even realise it was really there.\n\nIt was about two years before I forced myself to see somebody, and in this time I became really depressed. I'd never seriously considered a possible meaning to life, but I found myself asking why it was 'allowed' for me to hurt so much and feel so alone. Self-help reading became philosophy reading became theology reading.\n\nI think I'm bouncing back now, thanks to my counsellor and meditation, although I am still trapped in a pretty vicious cycle of rumination. I have the same sorts of thoughts every day, and it sucks because up until this depression I had taken a lot of joy in being creative. Anyway, I'm still happy all of this happened to me, because if I'd have stayed comfortable, and could've continued bottling everything up, I wouldn't be on this path of healing.\n\nAnyway, to hurt so much and then to feel like it was the most important two years of my life, I guess this was my spiritual awakening. I felt like I'd seen an order beneath chaos. I don't believe in anything specific, but I now feel it's a pretty weird assumption to say there's nothing but meaningless matter. What is conciousness? What came before the big bang? etc. etc.\n\nThe problem for me now is I feel spiritually homeless and unsettled. I don't feel comfortable with the amount of certainty religions preach. I'm also uncertain about Eastern practices, because in my personal case, I feel like they're attractive mainly by novelty and mystery. This is all personal, though, and I respect any good loving person's choices on these matters.\n\nMaybe my rumination is the heart of this issue, because I find myself wondering about stuff like 'the soul' every day, and it gets a bit tiring. I want a home, though. I'm sick of my spirit being so individualistic and formless. I want some sort of community and structuring ritual. I feel like without something to shape and refine this new dimension of myself, it's actually creating mental illness rather than healing it. It's a bit like I'm just tunneling into myself.\n\nI've always been interested in psychedelic drugs, and I know they can occasion mystical experience. I know they can give people what they believe to be experiences of God, but I think right now it'd just push me further out into the sea with no map.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sure this isn't too uncommon a position as a western spiritual person in 2019, so could anybody with any wisdom on my position please share it?

The instruments of work, the work itself and the worker are called the constituents of work. Any work done by any human being has these elements. Before one acts, there is some impetus, which is called inspiration. Any solution arrived at before work is actualized is a subtle form of work. Then work takes the form of action. First one has to undergo the psychological processes of thinking, feeling and willing, and that is called impetus. Actually the faith to perform acts is called knowledge. The inspiration to work is the same if it comes from the scripture or from the instruction of the spiritual master. When the inspiration is there and the worker is there, then actual activity takes place by the help of the senses. The mind is the center of all senses, and the object is work itself. These are the different phases of work as described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.

I think I finally understand the cause of suffering of humanity. We are too attached to everything in our lives. With attachment comes the fear of loss and with that fear of course anxiety and depression. We are holding on to things that can never last, which prevent us from experiencing the real life. All the spheres of our lives suffer because of it. We attach to people, jobs and even to our own thoughts and emotions. Untill we learn to detach from what we think and feel, we will be prisoners of our own minds.

In this book, he gives a daily meditation subject. I thought it might be fun, and insightful, to post them here, so all of you may be able to take them into your life and ponder them. (Mods, is this is not allowed, please let me know, and I will not continue)\n\nSeptember 12th\nThere Is No Freedom of Thought\n\n     \u201cI do not know if it is clear to each one of us that we live in a state of contradiction. We talk about peace, and prepare for war. We talk about nonviolence, and are fundamentally violent. We talk about being good, and we are not. We talk about love, and we are full of ambition, competitiveness, ruthless efficiency. So there is contradiction. The action that springs from that contradiction only brings about frustration and further contradiction...\n     You see, sirs, all thought is partial, it can never be total. Thought is the response of memory, and memory is always partial because memory is the result of experience, so thought is the reaction of a mind that is conditioned by experience. All thinking, all experience, all knowledge is inevitably partial; therefor, thought cannot solve the many problems that we have. You may try to reason logically, sanely, about these problems, but if you observe your own mind you will see that your thinking is conditioned by your circumstances, by the culture in which you were born, by the food you eat, by the climate you live in, by the newspapers you read, by the pressures and influences of your daily life...\n     So we must understand very clearly that our thinking is the response of memory, and memory is mechanistic. Knowledge is ever incomplete, and all thinking born of knowledge is limited, partial, never free. So there is no freedom of thought. But we can begin to discover a freedom which is not a process of thought, and in which the mind is simply aware of all its conflicts and of all the influences impinging upon it.\u201d", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 56867, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Daily Meditation from J.

More sensitive people have confirmed this for me that they could hear me the first time when 5 other people in the same room the same distance apart didn't even notice I had said something.\n\nIt's made me feel powerless all of my life and almost on am existential level, feeling really invalidated sometimes.

Nor is he bound by his actions.**\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nIn this verse the Lord informs Arjuna that the desire not to fight arises from false ego. Arjuna thought himself to be the doer of action, but he did not consider the Supreme sanction within and without. If one does not know that a super sanction is there, why should he act? But one who knows the instrument of work, himself as the worker, and the Supreme Lord as the supreme sanctioner, is perfect in doing everything. Such a person is never in illusion. Personal activity and responsibility arise from false ego and godlessness, or a lack of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Anyone who is acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under the direction of the Supersoul or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even though killing, does not kill. Nor is he ever affected with the reaction of such killing. When a soldier kills under the command of a superior officer, he is not subject to be judged. But if a soldier kills on his own personal account, then he is certainly judged by a court of law.\n\n**Question 1 : Why a person in Krishna consciousness isn't bound by his actions ?

Sometimes, no matter what you do they won't change because is what they decided, and is not your obligation, not even your right to change them either even if it's for their own good and yours. Sometimes you have to leave them behind.\n\nPeople are themselves, and you too. Once you have learned you should focus on yourself, just like everyone does. And hopefully some day you will have grown enough to see how useless it is to try to teach others beyond of what they want to learn. You are not responsible for anyone's fortune if they have decided a path. Not even if they might die or hurt themselves in the process because of their decisions. That's how things sometimes are. Be happy regardless, be free, be better despite of what you see around you and despite what seems possible. Be ready to leave people behind, people you love, people you care about. Because that shouldn't stop you from flying higher. Maybe one day they will see you up there and start to walk again on their own.\n\n- -\n\nFor anyone wondering the reason for this conclusion. I've been going to therapy because of mental manipulation from my family's side. Threads of abandonment and suicide that have gone too far. My psychiatrist told me to be vigilant of course of their health and do the legally correct thing, but not to care much for what they do or how they might end up. I guess uncaring is not the right word but I can't think of another one. They have decided to hurt themselves to prove a point and one has to be strong enough to say no, no matter how bad it gets. To not let anything disturb you and be able to stay calm and happy for yourself even when the other might be actually dying because is not your fault, not your responsibility, nothing you can do will stop them from doing so with the intent of hurting you too with their actions. So the best you can do is understand and better find a way to better yourself, to get out of the dark pit and see light even if that means leaving others behind despite of how much you love them and despite them not being actual bad people, just as lost as yourself. The difference is the will to get out. \n\nPeople are actually capable of hurting others on purpose. You have to be strong enough to not fall and crumble, be firm, while still be sure of your love.\n\n--also, first time here so I'm not sure if this is appropriate for this sub.

But, believe me, I\u2019m no Sith. It\u2019s something that really donned on me this afternoon, visiting a park in a corner of my city I\u2019ve never been to before. The atmosphere of the park, with sounds of children playing in the background, groups of friends talking around the lily pond, the bizarre sculptures in the park, they all provided some kind of magic that could only remind me of the innocence of my own childhood. \n\nI was listening to a song on the way to the park, a song who\u2019s lyrics seemed more or less deprecating in the past, but today the words just seemed to strike me in just the right way. As I walked in a happy daze around the park, a cheerful \u201cOn your left!\u201d woke me up as I said a friendly \u201cHey!\u201d to the biker lady passing by. She smiled sweetly before stopping at a group of people sitting before some yoga in the park. I couldn\u2019t think of a better place to stretch out. \n\nI couldn\u2019t help but gush at the small encounter as I walked away, part of me envying that I couldn\u2019t stay in this magical part of town, that I had to return to me own corner which isn\u2019t much less then car dealerships and outlet malls. But a deeper part of me clicked, with all of the little chance moments of the evening, awakening in me a realization, the sounds of early fall buzzing in my ears. \n\nLove is apparent to those who are in love. Think about it, in the start of a relationship, the whole world may as well be made of crimson and clover, the smell of jasmine permeating the air. But when love is lost, or doesn\u2019t seem to be there, the whole of reality may as well be made of thorns, bolts, and nuts. Nothing seems right, and everything is a cruel joke. You are the sad clown which the world is frightened of, and vice versa. \n\nBut what is this were far from the truth? What if this dark perception was nothing but a colored view, painted by ones own fears, hurts, angers. What is keeping us from being in love at every moment? Of embracing the light and love that exists inside of and outside of us? We can decide to be in love, with experience itself, and feel into the flow of life. Be in the current and just float into the growth, caring, and loving kindness that is just natural to living. \n\nAnywho, I guess this goes along the lines of \u201cyou attract what you do, say, and think\u201d.

Soulless ones are the people without souls, and source players are the people with souls. Entities are soulless beings that exist in the matrix but not people. So entities would be creatures like reptilians and aliens. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe soulless ones are powered by something called energy. When source players do lower frequency activities such as eating meat and having sex then they lose their energy and it is used to power the soulless ones. \n\nThere are eleven frequency levels for source players to be on. Until you stop eating meat you will not be able to rise to level 5 or higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is even more interesting is that she said this matrix we are currently in is actually a secondary matrix that was created from the primary matrix that we are hooked up to, but that both are powered by source energies.

When we do, there\u2019s two options. We either become everything and become aware of all of our past and future lives and then forget and incarnate again, or we become pure awareness in a void with no memories of any kind and then incarnate again.\n\nThere\u2019s always the possibility of a soul that lives in other planes for a while, but ultimately the soul dies.\n\nIf this is true, then the reason is that with there only being one experience of reality(one consciousness, one observer), no one else would ever exist with the observer experiencing them if we never die, except for one person.\n\nIn that case, no other persons ever even have an observer. This gives the possibility of being eternal, but just for me as the current observer from my perspective.\n\n\nI\u2019m going to be totally honest, all of those options sound terrible.\n\nAs much as life is suffering, I obviously don\u2019t want to experience being everything just to forget again, nothing just to forget again, or be alone for eternity.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to find a way in which it\u2019s possible for the one observer to experience multiple lives in parallel, for eternity.\n\nI\u2019d rather feel like crap every once and a while for eternity than the the two options, and fellow sufferers would be nice.\n\n\nI can\u2019t quite figure it out though. I\u2019ve been playing with the idea that each of our paths in life are finite, but because of the limit known as the speed of light, we never reach the speed required to reach the end of our life paths, and because of infinite detail in the universe, we constantly experience new things as we zoom into our life paths in a sense.\n\nThe problem is that since from my perspective, I am the current experiencer, if I never die then how can other lives ever be experienced?\n\nOne option is that I created time, and because of that we are all eternal with all of you being past lives that are now infinite.\n\nBut can\u2019t everyone say from their perspective they are time and that they created time?(which is actually the better case)\n\nI\u2019m just not sure how others could have created time as well as me in such a way that we are all capable of existing.\n\nIn a past life, if one of you created time, then you\u2019d never get to my life.\n\nIf we all created time as a future self of all of us.... then we would never reach the life to become time.\n\nSo it\u2019s a bit of a paradox...\n\nIs it possible to create time as a future life, that we eventually reach, but then once we do it is impossible to reach, and yet we are currently affected by it?\n\nDoes any of this make sense?\n\nI feel like the only reason life is really suffering is because non existence is the greatest peace there is, but we already exist and so we are screwed because we\u2019ll always want to exist. However it\u2019s only suffering if you dwell on it, and if you occupy your time then there\u2019s always good and bad times to be experienced.\n\nHaving said that, I don\u2019t want to keep dwelling on this, but I\u2019ll be more at peace if I had a stable theory for the existence of fellow eternal sufferers...", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 56527, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Eternity Paradox", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568235718, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d2efhd/eternity_paradox/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "KenIsBackTellSomeMen", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1nfuxzl4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568148314, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d2e5w3/i_spend_too_much_time_surrounding_myself_with/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d2e5w3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 30, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d2e5w3/i_spend_too_much_time_surrounding_myself_with/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568148317, "score": 63, "selftext": "I just wanted to share this somewhere after having the realisation.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 56526, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I spend too much time surrounding myself with negativity, whether that be how I see myself, how I see others, and the things I read online.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568234703, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d2e5w3/i_spend_too_much_time_surrounding_myself_with/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "menjac21", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_qfsjd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568147814, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d2e11g/free_distant_energy_healing_for_affirmation_you/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d2e11g", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d2e11g/free_distant_energy_healing_for_affirmation_you/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "f1VY9jMXsS8lihjdrAatcW_eaRU64lHHyBsr03Qhnqc", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/o62kIYejTOaNmN1Rgfx0xf-ZfRaxmmcijwQgIiUQqzg.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21fc0a1e09e00a5274f501b66cec81bcf78494a9", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/o62kIYejTOaNmN1Rgfx0xf-ZfRaxmmcijwQgIiUQqzg.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fd36c78e9725ca94ba8b1267f2e579930d31695", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/o62kIYejTOaNmN1Rgfx0xf-ZfRaxmmcijwQgIiUQqzg.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efa18c6aa33bc67aaf661b23159e9bc5ef0e93eb", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/o62kIYejTOaNmN1Rgfx0xf-ZfRaxmmcijwQgIiUQqzg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=780c8083d2acd6da89de6e76266e3817a02d9c46", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1568147816, "score": 1, "selftext": "just focus on your affirmation for around one second and see how you feel physically, emotionally, spiritually, energetically and psychologically about it then let it go. then when you feel a change pause the video and refocus on the SAME affirmation and see what has change .\n\nPS;

I personally love learning about the Byzantine Christian history. It\u2019s sacred knowledge, mixed with lots of half truths and humanly corruption and injustice written through the hand of men, not god. \nAnyways. We come into a church.

But the Operation of God, is Mind and Soul.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n13. Of Eternity, Permanence, or Long-lasting, and Immortality\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n14. Of the World, Restitution, and Decay or Destruction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n15. Of Time, Augmentation and Diminution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n16. And of Generation, Qualities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n17. Therefore Eternity is in God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n18. The World in Eternity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n19. Time in the World.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n20. And Generation in Time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n21. And Eternity standeth about God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n22. The World is moved in Eternity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n23. Time is determined in the World.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n24. Generation is done in Time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n25. Therefore the Spring and Fountain of all things is God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n26. The Substance Eternity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n27. The Matter is the World.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n28. The Power of God is Eternity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n29. And the Work of Eternity is the World not yet made, and yet ever made by Eternity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n30. Therefore shall nothing be at any time destroyed, for Eternity is incorruptible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n31. Neither can anything perish, or be destroyed in the World, the World being contained and embraced\n\nby eternity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n32. But what is the Wisdom of God? Even the Good, and the Fair and Blessedness, and every Virtue,\n\nand Eternity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n33. Eternity therefore put into the Matter Immortality and Everlastingness; for the Generation of that\n\ndepends upon Eternity, even as Eternity doth of God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n34. For Generation and Time, in Heaven, and in Earth, are of a double Nature; in Heaven they are\n\nunchangeable and incorruptible, but on Earth they are changeable and corruptible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n35. And the Soul of Eternity is God; and the Soul of the World, Eternity; and of the Earth, Heaven.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n36. God is in the Mind, the Mind in the Soul; the Soul in the Matter, all things by Eternity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n37. All this Universal Body, in which are all Bodies, is full of Soul, the Soul full of Mind, the Mind full of\n\nGod.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n38. For within he fills them, and without he contains them, quickening the Universe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n39. Without he quickens this perfect living thing the World, and within all living Creatures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n40. And above in Heaven he abides in Identity or Selfness, but below upon Earth he changeth\n\nGeneration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n41. Eternity comprehendeth the World, either by Necessity, or Providence, or Nature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n42. And if any man shall think any other thing, it is God that actuateth, or operateth this All.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n43. But the operation or Act of God, is power insuperable, to which none may compare anything, either\n\nHuman or Divine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n44. Therefore, O Hermes, think none of these things below, or the things above, in any wise like unto\n\nGod, for if thou dost thou errest from the Truth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n45. For nothing can be like the unlike, and only and One; nor mayest thou think, that he bath given of his\n\nPower to any other thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n46. For who after him can make anything, either of Life, or Immortality; of Change or of Quality, and\n\nhimself what other thing should he make.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n47. For God is not idle, for then all things would be idle ; for all things are full of God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n48. But there is not anywhere in the world such a thing as Idleness; for Idleness is a name that implieth a\n\nthing void or empty, both of a Doer and a thing done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n49. But all things must necessarily be made or done both always and according to the nature of every\n\nplace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n50. For he that maketh or doth, is in all things, yet not fastened or comprehended in anything, nor making\n\nor doing one thing, but all things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n51. For being an active or operating Power and sufficient of himself for the things that are made, and the\n\nthings that are made are under him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n52. Look upon, through me, the World is subject to thy sight, and understand exactly the Beauty thereof.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n53. A Body immarcessible, than the which, there is nothing more ancient, yet always vigorous and young.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n54. See also the seven Worlds set over us, adorned with an everlasting Order, and filling Eternity, with a\n\ndifferent course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n55. For all things are full of Light, but the Fire is nowhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n56. For the friendship and commixture of contraries and unlike, became Light shining from the Act or\n\nOperation of God, the Father of all Good, the Prince of all Order, and the Ruler of the seven Worlds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n57. Look also upon the Moon, the forerunner of them all, the Instrument of Nature, and which changeth\n\nthe Matter here below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n58. Behold the Earth, the middle of the whole, the firm and stable Foundation of the Fair World, the\n\nFeeder and Nurse of Earthly things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n59. Consider moreover, how great the multitude is of immortal living things, and of mortal ones also; and\n\nsee the Moon going about in the midst of both, to wit, of things immortal and mortal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n60. But all things are full of Soul, and all things are properly moved by it; some things about the Heaven,\n\nand some things about the Earth, and neither of those on the right hand to the left; nor those on the left\n\nhand to the right; nor those things that are above, downward; nor those things that are below, upwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n61. And that all these things are made, O beloved Hermes, thou needst not learn of me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n62. For they are Bodies, and have a Soul, and are moved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n63. And that all these should come together into one, it is impossible without some thing, to gather them\n\ntogether.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n64. Therefore there must be some such ones, and he altogether One.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n65. For seeing that the motions are divers, and many, and the Bodies not alike, and yet one ordered\n\nswiftness among them all; It is impossible there should be two or more Makers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n66. For one order is not kept by many.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n67. But in the weaker, there would be jealousy of the stronger and thence also Contentions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n68. And if there were one Maker of mutable and mortal living wight \\[a creature\\]s, he would desire also to\n\nmake immortal ones, as he that were the Maker of immortal ones, would do to make mortal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n69. Moreover also, if there were two, the Matter being one, who should be chief, or have the disposing of\n\nthe facture?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n70. Or if both of them, which of them the greater part?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n71. But think thus that every living Body bath its consistence of Matter and Soul; and of that which is\n\nimmortal, and that which is mortal, and unreasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n72. For all living Bodies have a Soul; and those things that are not living are only matter by itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n73. And the Soul likewise of itself drawing near her Maker, is the Cause of Life, and Being, and Being the\n\ncause of Life, is after a manner, the cause of immortal things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n74. How then are mortal wight \\[a creature\\]s, other from immortal?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n75. Or how cannot he make living wight \\[a creature\\]s that causeth immortal things and immortality ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n76. That there is some Body that doth these things it is apparent, and that he is also one, it is most\n\nmanifest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n77. For there is one Soul, one Life and one Matter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n78. Who is this? Who can it be other than the One God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n79. For whom else can it benefit, to make living things, save only God alone?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n80. There is therefore one God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n81. For it is a ridiculous thing to confess the World to be, one Sun, one Moon, one Divinity; and yet to\n\nhave I know not how many gods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n82. He therefore being One, doth all things in many things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n83. And what great thing is it for God to make Life and Soul, and Immortality, and Change, when thy self\n\ndost so many things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n84. For thou both seest, speakest and hearest, smellest, tastest, and touchest, walkest, understandest,\n\nand breathest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n85. And it is not one that seeth, and another that heareth, and another that speaketh, and another that\n\ntoucheth, and another that smelleth, and another that walketh, and another that understandeth, and\n\nanother that breatheth, but One that doth all these things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n86. Yet neither can these things possibly be without God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n87. For as thou, if thou shouldst cease from doing these things, were not a living wight \\[a creature\\]; so if\n\nGod should cease from those, he were not (which is not lawful to say) any longer God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n88. For if it be already demonstrated, that nothing can be idle or empty, how much more may be affirmed\n\nof God?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n89. For if there be any thing which he doth not do, then is he (if it were lawful to say so) imperfect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n90. Whereas feeling he is not idle, but perfect, certainly he doth all things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n91. Now give thy self unto me, O Hermes, for a little while thou shalt the more easily understand, that it is\n\nthe necessary work of God that all things should be made or done, that are done, or were once done, or shall be done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n92. And this, O best Beloved, is life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n93. And this is the Fair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n94. And this is the Good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n95. And this is God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n96. And if thou wilt understand this by work also, mark what happens to thy self, when thou wilt generate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n97. And yet this is not like unto him; for he is not sensible of pleasure, for neither hath he any other\n\nFellow-workman.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n98. But being himself the only Workman he is always in the Work, himself being that which he doth or\n\nmaketh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n99. For all things, if they were separated from him, must needs fall and die, as there being no life in them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n100. And again, if all things be living wight \\[a creature\\]s, both which are in Heaven, and upon Earth; and\n\nthat there be one Life in all things which are made by God, and that is God, then certainly all things are\n\nmade, or done by God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n101. Life is the union of the Mind and the Soul.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n102. But death is not the destruction of those things that were gathered together, but a dissolving of the\n\nUnion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n103. The Image therefore of God is Eternity, of Eternity the World, of the World the Sun, of the Sun Man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n104. But the people say, That changing is Death, because the Body is dissolved, and the Life goeth into\n\nthat which appeareth not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n105. By this discourse, my dearest Hermes, I affirm as thou hearest, That the World is changed, because\n\nevery day part thereof becomes invisible ; but that it is never dissolved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n106. And these are the Passions of the World, Revolutions and Occultations, and Revolution is a turning,\n\nbut Occultation is Renovation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n107. And the World being all formed, bath not the forms lying without it, but itself changeth in itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n108. Seeing then the World is all formed, what must he be that made it? for without form he cannot be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n109. And if he be all formed, he will be kept like the World, but if he have but one form, he shall be in this\n\nregard less then the World.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n110. What do we then say that he is? we will not raise any doubts by our speech; for nothing that is\n\ndoubtful concerning God, is yet known.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n111. He hath therefore one Idea which is proper to him, which because it is unbodily is not subject to the\n\nsight, and yet shows all forms by the Bodies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n112. And do not wonder, if there be an incorruptible Idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n113. For they are like the Margents of that Speech which is in writing; for they seem to be high and\n\nswelling, hut they are by nature smooth and even.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n114. But understand well this that I say, more boldly, for it is more true; As a man cannot live without life,\n\nso neither can God live, not doing good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n115. For this is, as it were, the Life and Motion of God, to move all things, and quicken them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n116. But some of the things I have said, must have a particular explication; Understand then what I say.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n117. All things are in God, not as lying in a place; for Place is both a Body, and unmoveable, and those\n\nthings that are there placed, have no motion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n118. For they lie otherwise in that which is unbodily, than in the fantasy or to appearance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n119. Consider him that contains all things, and understand, that nothing is more capacious, than that\n\nwhich is incorporeal, nothing more swift, nothing more powerful, but it is most capacious, most swift and\n\nmost strong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n120. And judge of this by thyself, command thy Soul to go into India, and sooner than thou canst bid it, it\n\nwill be there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n121. Bid it likewise pass over the Ocean, and suddenly it will be there; Not as passing from place to\n\nplace, but suddenly it will be there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n122. Command it to fly into Heaven, and it will need no Wings, neither shall anything hinder it; not the fire\n\nof the Sun, not the Aether, not the turning of the Spheres, not the bodies of any of the other Stars, but\n\ncutting through all, it will fly up to the last, and furthest Body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n123. And if thou wilt even break the whole, and see those things that are without the World (if there be\n\nany thing without) thou mayest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n124. Behold how great power, how great swiftness thou hast! Canst thou do all these things, and cannot\n\nGod?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n125. After this manner therefore contemplate God to have all the whole World to himself, as it were all\n\nthoughts, or intellections.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n126. If therefore thou wilt not equal thy self to God, thou canst not understand God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n127. For the like is intelligible by the like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n128. Increase thy self into an immeasurable greatness, leaping beyond every Body; and transcending all\n\nTime, become Eternity and thou shalt understand God: If thou believe in thyself that nothing is\n\nimpossible, but accountest thy self immortal, and that thou canst understand all things, every Art, every\n\nScience and the manner and custom of every living thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n129. Become higher than all height, lower than all depths, comprehend in thy self, the qualities of all the\n\nCreatures, of the Fire, the Water, the Dry and Moist; and conceive likewise, that thou canst at once be\n\neverywhere in the Sea, in the Earth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n130. Thou shalt at once understand thy self, not yet begotten in the Womb, young, old, to be dead, the\n\nthings after death, and all these together as also times, places, deeds, qualities, quantities, or else thou\n\ncanst not yet understand God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n131. But if thou shut up thy Soul in the Body and abuse it, and say, I understand nothing, I can do\n\nnothing, I am afraid of the Sea, I cannot climb up into Heaven, I know not who I am, I cannot tell what I\n\nshall be; what hast thou to do with God; for thou canst understand none of those Fair and Good things; be a lover of the Body, and Evil.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n132. For it is the greatest evil, not to know God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n133. But to be able to know and to will, and to hope, is the straight way, and Divine way, proper to the\n\nGood; and it will everywhere meet thee, and everywhere be seen of thee, plain and easy, when thou dost\n\nnot expect or look for it; it will meet thee, waking, sleeping, sailing, travelling, by night, by day, when thou\n\nspeakest, and when thou keepest silence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n134. For there is nothing which is not the Image of God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n135. And yet thou sayest, God is invisible, but be advised, for who is more manifest than He.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n136. For therefore hath he made all things, that thou by all things mayest see him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n137. This is the Good of God, this is his Virtue, to appear, and to be seen in all things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n138. There is nothing invisible, no, not of those things that are incorporeal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n139. The Mind is seen in Understanding, and God is seen in doing or making.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n140. Let these things thus far forth, be made manifest unto thee, O Trismegistus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n141.

So I\u2019ve been studying Tarot for 2 to 3 years but I have only done in-depth readings for a handful of people. Not sure why, some sort of fear block evidently. Trying to move past that. If you would like a reading, Please direct message me your full birth name first middle and last, your date of birth and any question that you would like me to focus on. Is there something going on in your work that you have questions about? Are you torn about taking a job out of town? Is there someone that you have mixed feelings about this in your personal life? The more specific your question the better. These take me 2 to 3 hours to do. I\u2019ll look up your general astrology and your numerology and then blend it with your reading and see where it takes us and then write you up a 2 to 3 page answer to your query. If u dont want to share emails, i can post a link to dropbox or something.

We are going to begin to explain to you how this Earth adventure began for all of you, and we will try to show you the background which will explain why your lives here seem so arduous and so arbitrary in several respects.  We might title this \u201cWhy Do Bad Things Happen to Good People?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, let us begin with the concept of relativity.  \u201cBad\u201d is a relative term, one that is created for 3 dimensional experience where people have free will.  It is usually used to describe an event, an action, even a thought or feeling which might be considered to be hurtful to living beings, especially people.  People in a 3D free will environment are expected to do things that are \u201cgood\u201d and not do things that are \u201cbad.\u201d  Over the course of generations, each culture spends quite a lot of time and energy trying to decide what is good and what is bad, and making up rules and laws to enforce the agreed-upon definitions.  This process is ongoing and fraught with disagreement, as individuals and groups argue with each other about what is Truly Good and what is Truly Bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese definitions of what is good or bad, approved or disapproved, expand and evolve over time as civilizations develop, but always there are debates and discussions about what God (Spirit, Creator, One, Jehovah, Allah, etc.) thinks is Good or Bad.  The most arrogant and belligerent of believers in Righteousness profess to know for certain what God believes, and they try to force their particular interpretation of What is Good and What is Bad on everyone else.  The most offensive of these sects or cults, who often call themselves True Believers, put pressure on their leaders to write and enforce laws to control others as an expression of these beliefs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis, Dear Ones, is the most backward, inside-out approach to producing a safe and secure society in which everyone can thrive.  We will speak to you a little about what we call The True Way, and how we suggest that you begin to learn what it means.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have heard us say that we don\u2019t like to give you exact dates, except the ones that you yourselves have identified as your particular goal-dates, or the ones which are directly connected to cosmic events which you identify as particular days on your calendar.  (We do not use calendars, you see.)  You have the habit of becoming fixed on a particular point in time, and then are disappointed when what you imagined would happen did not occur.  The same occurs with rules.  We give you a simple set of Universal Laws, and you spend the next twelve millennia trying to interpret and \u201cfigure out\u201d what they mean, rather than communicating with Us to understand them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is one of the reasons we have not simply laid out a list of rules for you here.  Instead, we talk with you in the spirit of Unconditional Love, Compassion and Truth which are basic tenets of The True Way.  We tell you that Love is the energy of the higher dimensions, and that your educational path here on Earth is for the sole purpose of learning to become the expression of Unconditional Love in all you say and do.  When you are able to do that, you ascend yourself (we have just made up a verb) into higher dimensions.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a crucial part of the lessons - you lift yourselves.  We do not do it for you, or give it to you as a reward for \u201cgood\u201d behavior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the same token, no human or other living entity can ascend you, or descend you.  No one can do it for you, even Us, just as no one can breathe for you or think for you.  They may try, but ultimately, only you, in loving consultation with Us, can create your life  plan and execute it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce you decide upon your long-range ambitions and the short-range lessons you wish to experience, We, the Guides, Masters, Enlightened Ones, ancestors and your own soul family members develop a plan for each lifetime, down to each major event and each important relationship which we together deem most beneficial for you.  In all these discussions and planning sessions, you are the Director and Head of your own committee.  Of course we may make strong recommendations, and your Greater Soul, in cooperation with your Twin Flame, will have considerable input into this process, but the final decision is yours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, this brings us to this Earth experience, and why anyone would want to come here, to the planet of tears and suffering, if they had a choice to do otherwise.  Well, believe Us, Dear Ones, you had the choice of the entire Universe for your lessons, and you chose Gaia as your proving ground, your University of first-choice, much as your college students apply and go through the acceptance process when they choose their course of study.  Yes, Earth is the Ivy League of Higher Education, and we assure you that the only ones who end up here, are here because it was their first choice for this lifetime.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut why, why why you ask of Us.  Do not ask us.  Look inside yourself, inside your own souls.  Look for the spark of Divine, loving energy.  Look for the love of excitement, variety, challenge and change.  It is within you just as it is within Us.  The Universe is change, movement, excitement, energy in flux.  Nothing stays the same; there is no status quo in the Multiverse.  You are as much a part of that shifting, evolving energy as We are.  Yes, some of you will say that all you want is peace, to control the change, get a handle on it, get on top of it, make it stop.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is no stopping the Universe; that is one of the first Laws of the Universe - it is in constant motion, and so are you.  You cannot continue this life in the body if the heart stops pumping.  You could not see if your eyes did not continue their flickering motion.  You could not remain on the planet if she stopped spinning.  To challenge this inevitability is beyond foolhardy, it is impossible.  Yet, with each lifetime you must relearn this lesson:  your experience here is lived within the order and requirements of Universal Law, and by Universal Law, we do not mean democratically chosen political decisions.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUniversal Laws are a given, a system of Truths within which we all operate.    You may ask all your lifetimes to understand Universal Laws, but you may not ask to change them, for yourself or for others.  No discussion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe will discuss what your options and opportunities are within the structure of life in the Universe where you currently reside.  This is what we call the True Way - the expression of life in all its variety and glory, within the tenets of Universal Law.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother crucial element in understanding this life on Earth is the Universal Law which requires respect and appreciation of all living things, all consciousness, because we are all part of the One, and this means you.  There are no exceptions:  all life is precious beyond measure, yours included.  Therefore, suicide is not an option.  It would be in defiance of the precious gift of life you are given when you elected to come here, but beyond that, it is Universal Law.  Once you have consciously joined your soul to the body you currently inhabit, you have created a new being - the Self you are in this particular configuration, and this Self must evolve through the seasons of its intended lifetime, as all created Beings do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotice that we have chosen the words carefully in describing this process.  You have deliberately chosen to join with this body.  In doing so, you have taken into account the vagaries and complications of conception and fetal development, including the decisions of the parents and the health of the mother and fetus.  All this has been considered before the final choice to commit to joining once and for all with this body, and to continue on the path of this envisioned life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where the complications and twists and turns of life come in.  Some of you came here with the intention of living a short life, or an especially difficult life, to accomplish a particular goal.  To that end, a fatal disease, disability or accident may have been part of the original plan.  Some of you came to test yourselves in your courage to hold to the principles of Unconditional Love in action.  You are the ones who have written into your plan encounters with evil, injustice and deceit.  You will push yourselves through the most difficult challenges, ride out the disappointments and defeats and repeatedly pick yourselves up, brush yourselves off and go on, wiser and stronger after each test of your mettle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, it is you, Dear Ones, who envision, create and live out your most arduous challenges.  You are not alone in this process, however.  Your Twin Flame, the mirror of your soul and the partner who shares your growth and your struggles, is with you every step of the way.  You may have thought of this Being who is with you always as your Guardian Angel or your Main Guide, but they are much more.  You were born together, as twin sparks of the same soul, and you remain together throughout eternity, as the two molecules of hydrogen remain together with oxygen (Us) to create water, the precious element of Life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a later message, we will explain to you some of the extraordinary challenges and duties of the Twin Flame who remains in higher dimensions while you, the incarnate one, live out this life on Gaia.  For now, we leave you to ponder this Universal Truth:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou are One, you are Two, We are Three, and we are One.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are Mother/Father God, and we are Unconditional Love.\n\n  \n\n\nChanneled by Kathryn E.

It was strictly lust, we never had a soul / mind connection. Then when he came to terms with what he wanted and he wanted me, we started to really spend time together. And I knew right away that it was not right. We just didn\u2019t have much to talk about, had very different values, and generally just weren\u2019t compatible.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m young and I didn\u2019t have anything else to do so I kept seeing him. Every time I tried to walk away, he would leave letters at my house and send me messages all the time and wouldn\u2019t let me move on. We moved in together and for that year of us living together I was SO depressed. I felt like a shell of a human being. He just sucked the life right out of me, always needing more attention and energy than I\u2019m capable of giving. It was never enough anyway. \n\nI\u2019m about to move across the country and so he moved into his friends place, and I\u2019ve felt so much more alive and happy in these past 2 months, but still struggling to release him. He wants to do long distance, and I\u2019m afraid he will never let me go. I\u2019ve broken up with him once 7 months ago, and he just berated me with texts and calls telling me how much he was hurting. And I\u2019m scared of that again. \n\nEven after we part ways, I can feel that energy of suffering in him and I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m always struggling with the guilt of staying in a relationship that isn\u2019t serving me or his highest purpose. I struggle with doubt, wondering if it\u2019s a twin flame and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard and I just need to push through.. but I know in my heart of hearts it isn\u2019t. \n\nI just want to release this karmic relationship and move on to happier times. I\u2019m tired of feeling ashamed, guilty, and tired.

I simultaneously want them to wake up and also for myself return to that easy and sense driven lifestyle.. even though I know it will never be truly satisfying in the way I am seeking. \n\nI find myself thinking, is it really like this? Is this really the way it all works? But I know surely that it does. Can anyone share some thoughts to focus on until this part of waking up passes?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 56431, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Coming to terms with The Dream", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568185016, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d23yvp/coming_to_terms_with_the_dream/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "JohnMcGoodmaniganson", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_m3riy", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568098515, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d23y8n/new_to_the_sub_and_wanted_to_share_something/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d23y8n", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d23y8n/new_to_the_sub_and_wanted_to_share_something/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568098516, "score": 3, "selftext": "Hello. As mentioned, I just joined the sub and wanted to share a youtube channel I discovered a while back. I'm an atheist and have struggled for a long while with the importance of spirituality and where to find it. One technique that has always calmed my mind and spirit is relaxation and meditation. I got really into ASMR videos for this reason and loved the calm, soothing nature of the ASMRtists. In my search for more content, I came across a channel that is not ASMR but can still be triggering for many people. It features an old, English, Christian man named John Butler and a co-host who more or less guides the direction of discussion. John has had a very interesting life of farming, living abroad, and struggling to find himself and he has mastered meditation over the years. The themes of his discussions usually center around finding what he calls the stillness around us. Despite his Christianity, his ideas and points of view are not polarizing. He simply has an immense peacefulness about him with incredible wisdom and a very soothing way of speaking in order to share these traits. Anyway, I love listening to him and I often feel as though a weight is lifted off of me afterwards. Maybe you'll have a similar experience.  \n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi0TFuqj6eND-mJRf8i2Tnw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi0TFuqj6eND-mJRf8i2Tnw)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 56431, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New to the sub and wanted to share something", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568184895, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d23y8n/new_to_the_sub_and_wanted_to_share_something/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LoveWins1997", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_452lb9o0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568096343, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d23nl7/why_is_there_a_physical_world_why_do_we_have/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d23nl7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d23nl7/why_is_there_a_physical_world_why_do_we_have/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "x7ywftj9PgWf3FGlTYR0VaKAv4BpoTmk1I3VqLyiyzE", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/rvDK6purYGTG9ZIs84V3sfQqihw9UzdiHAmZdIaa5i0.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82de88f11ddde260418a0b58dd8f1e1b6f87d89b", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/rvDK6purYGTG9ZIs84V3sfQqihw9UzdiHAmZdIaa5i0.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8745c8e400b62a78c2851c48cf56285122333d0a", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/rvDK6purYGTG9ZIs84V3sfQqihw9UzdiHAmZdIaa5i0.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcc0c3e692a23ec4bd2293ba0b627d4899f25631", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/rvDK6purYGTG9ZIs84V3sfQqihw9UzdiHAmZdIaa5i0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=2df8f2fbd481899ef602186c433aeefaf55dafe6", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1568096344, "score": 2, "selftext": " [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKVPNmY\\_tO0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKVPNmY_tO0) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Is the physical world a product of an evil demiurge?

I knew I didn\u2019t like being at home and I thought it was me just being a young adult, but with some meditation and deep thought I realized I have been carrying this weight around for some time. For some reason I could never feel truly comfortable around my family; just be completely who I am. My parents are pretty critical, so as I try to express myself sometimes they usually question why or try to suggest. I feel like my parents nitpicked at me my whole life and I never felt accepted by them; or sometimes they way they would talk to me, made me feel like they didn\u2019t believe I could change. They are muslim though, so I wasn\u2019t really allowed to do the things my peers did as teens. They just kinda told me what they thought I should be doing, instead of making me feel understood and then proceeding into character development. I\u2019m 20 years old with no sense of fashion because my clothing was always heavily regulated... Many people have these great intimate relationships with their mom, but I still feel on guard around her. The people that have heard my talk to my mom, tell me that i speak to her with no emotion or tone of voice... and I think i just learned to do that to avoid even more criticism. It has gotten better now that I\u2019m older (I\u2019m 20.) I understand some stuff, though.. as a parent to a teenager you have to be cautious. It logically makes sense but I can\u2019t seem to feel that way inside. I have felt this way for about 5 years. I just can\u2019t let it go. \n\nI\u2019m able to be nice to everyone but my family... I\u2019m not mean to them, either but Honestly I don\u2019t feel like doing nice things for my family members because I don\u2019t think they would appreciate it (my siblings.) i do do things that are nice out of the goodness of my heart, but my kindness is not reaching its full potential.\n\nIt just doesn\u2019t feel genuine when my mom tells me she loves me... I know she means it but I just don\u2019t receive it. Or sometimes when I\u2019m alone making dinner for myself, my mom comes and it just kinda ruins my mind. Everyday she comes home  from work, I hope she doesn\u2019t stop by my room (because of the burning awkwardness I feel to return her excitement to see me) but she always does. Sometimes when she even touches me i just clench up on the inside, preparing for a criticism or just simply out of rejection. She would be really happy to talk about something with me and i would just want to be left alone. Even when I emotionally remove myself i feel bad and feel like I\u2019m being coldhearted and that she doesn\u2019t deserve that. \n\n\nIt sucks seeing all this typed out, but I\u2019m making a lot of progress in other parts of my life, an \u201cawakening\u201d occurred within me a few months ago and I\u2019ve been so happy. This is the last thing in the way. I want to forgive my mom and my siblings but I don\u2019t even know how to begin. I don\u2019t speak to my dad; my parents are still married and living together, but me and him haven\u2019t had a relationship since January. \n\nSo... I\u2019m very conflicted :/ if it helps.

Maybe I ate one too many mushrooms but hear me out. Around a year ago I saw a UFO in San Luis Obispo, California for the first time and then a month later I saw another one in Seattle. Both crafts were equilateral triangles that moved without sound through the use of antigravity technology. These experiences began my journey of personal discovery where I started to question everything I thought I knew. I believe that we are multidimensional spiritual beings existing within a trippy simulation operated by a spectrum of inter-dimensional and transcendent entities. I know it seems crazy lol and I spend plenty of time questioning my own sanity. I also believe that the average person does not begin to tap into their true potential. Our minds have the power to manifest reality and death is the biggest illusion of all. I was raised in an atheist household and I never used to believe any of this stuff but once a mind is opened to new truths it is hard to close.

but I need to get this off my chest and feel like this sub might be a good place to do just that. \n\nAfter years of substance abuse, social anxiety, and paranoia, I woke up this morning to the realization that my life is in shambles. \n\nI don\u2019t have a single friend anymore. I used to have a few good people I hung out with but over the past 3 years I gradually lost contact with all of them. Just yesterday I reached out to one of them on Facebook but the response was lukewarm at best, they haven\u2019t sent more than that one message to me so I know that\u2019s a futile attempt at rekindling an old friendship. \n\nGirls don\u2019t like me either. I haven\u2019t been in a relationship since I left high school (I\u2019m 26 btw) and all of my attempts at meeting women go nowhere. I see so many people around my age in good relationships experiencing the joys of young love while I sit in the corner of the room and feel lucky if someone just says hi. \n\nI can\u2019t talk about this loneliness to my family because they still get upset that I\u2019m unemployed without a college education and will always revert the conversation back to that, saying that getting a job in a company will bring me the happiness and purpose I\u2019m looking for. (Which couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.) \n\nI\u2019ve let all of my hobbies fade away, my fitness, music, meditation. I can\u2019t even be bothered with watching television anymore. I\u2019m struggling to find any kind of enjoyment in anything when in the back of my mind I\u2019m still just as lonely as when I\u2019m not doing these things. \n\nI feel unfocused, unmotivated, and like there is absolutely nothing to look forward to in my life. \n\nThis loneliness is the most pain I\u2019ve felt in ages and it\u2019s the pain that\u2019s stayed with me the longest throughout my life, since I\u2019ve never really \u201cfitted in\u201d anywhere. \n\nI suppose I can try to start meditation again and doing yoga and eating healthy food, but none of these things are going to bring new people into my life, and that\u2019s all I really want at this point. \n\nAm I to just let go of this craving for social interaction and focus on my spiritual path? Where does that even begin? I used to think I knew but \u201cthinking I knew\u201d has only made me realize how much I don\u2019t know. \n\nAny thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated. \n\nNamaste \ud83d\ude4f", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 56280, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Feeling absolutely hopeless.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568119632, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d1qfty/feeling_absolutely_hopeless/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "dazeylo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4juoac7r", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568032982, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d1qe5w/dream_three_important_universal_energies/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d1qe5w", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d1qe5w/dream_three_important_universal_energies/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568032983, "score": 1, "selftext": "This summer I attended my 2nd year at my favourite music/hippie festival. \nIt was a wild ride to say the least.\nThis festival was extremely spiritual, therapeutic, and deeply nourished my soul.

I had countless encounters here but one that really struck me as spiritual was at the end of the festival.

However, once the threat had passed, the response shut down and the body\u2019s systems returned to normal.\u201d*\n\n### [Causes of Stress in Modern\u00a0Life](https://sosmethod.co/stress-and-modern-life/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=organic)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 56266, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Modern Life &amp; Stress", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568110726, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d1ozcr/modern_life_stress/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Sham_Pain_Renegade", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2ua7l11d", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568023303, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d1otzq/does_anyone_else_get_extremely_warmoverheated/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d1otzq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d1otzq/does_anyone_else_get_extremely_warmoverheated/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568023303, "score": 54, "selftext": "I\u2019ve had this start happening after a really bad car accident that I was in almost four years ago.

You can feel it radiating off me. It happens if I hug a loved one, too. It\u2019s not just like a getting overheated due to anything else. And it\u2019s just wherever my body is in contact to someone I love. I come into contact with other people all the time and it doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nSorry if this doesn\u2019t belong here but the warmth is something I can\u2019t explain and I just wanted to see if anyone else experienced it or know anything about it.

((DECIDE ON THE LONGEVITY OF YOUR NEXT RELATIONSHIP))\n\nI often hear comments of dissatisfaction concerning the longevity of romantic relationships. These are comments that come from people who blow through many short-lived relationships. Relationships that were the result of pre-decided intentions before the two met. Point being, a long-lasting relationship can only be the experience of two people who both decided on longevity before they met. If their relationship-intentions do not shoot for the stars, then they will meet someone who identically has intentions that do not shoot for the stars. The duration of the relationship is entirely determined before two people meet because that belief is already seeded in the intentions that draw the two together. \n\nWhat they need to understand is that the lifeline of their contract has already been established before they met the other person. The contract already had an expiration date before they locked eyes with a person of interest and said \u201chello.\u201d This lifeline is a result of a default-attraction because neither person full-heartedly decided on the lifeline of their next relationship before they met. This can be a result of not deciding on, or not believing it will happen (which can be reversed if they BOTH decide on longevity during the relationship). Therefore, their former beliefs dictated the lifeline of the relationship. Don't forget that birds of a feather flock together which is why these indecisive individuals attracted each other. Deciding on the longevity of the experiences you wish to have should always be a part of your intentions. \n\nThis is a truth that doesn't limit itself to romantic relationships. This also applies to every and any relationship you will ever have with another co-creator, including the ones you don't want to be a part of. To enter any relationship without previously set intentions puts you at a disadvantage where you will be used for the power you haven't claimed as your own, or will end up spinning your wheels and wasting your time with unwanted experiences. Therefore, as far as romance goes, try to move your fantasy or focus away from the beginning \u201choneymoon phase\u201d and shift your focus a few years into the \u201csettled down\u201d part of the relationship. If thoughts of being settled with another doesn\u2019t enamor you, yet you feel bitter about your short-lived relationships, then there is some self-searching you need to do in order to find the hidden beliefs that are compromising your harmony. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. ((FOCUS ON THE EXPERIENCE))\n\nWhen attracting co-creators into your life for mutual experiences, avoid obsessing over the details about the person you want to attract, to share your life with. Instead, stay focused on the experiences you wish to have with another co-creator. You can obsess all you want about the experiences. By prioritizing the details over the experience you wish to have, you are micromanaging. For example, if you want to experience being with someone who's lips and face you want to kiss all day, then it goes without saying that this person will have a face you think is gorgeous that you will like to look at and kiss. You can't logically concoct an image of a person who will take your breath away because if you could, your breath wouldn\u2019t be taken away. You can, however, decide on the experience then trust it's out there for you to discover. If you can experience it in your mind before you attract it, then there would be no point in attracting it. One of the ingredients that make an experience is an element of the unknown. Therefore, it is enough to know what you want to experience so the universe can surprise you with it.   \n\nIt is very common to see exercises in the name of attracting a partner where you are told to concentrate mainly on the type of person you wish to draw in. Remember that to do this is to micromanage. The only things you should be focused on, concerning who the person is going to be, are the dealmakers and the deal-breakers. What this means is, there are certain aspects that a person must possess and must not possess for you to have an interest. Being meticulously aware of your dealmakers and deal-breakers should only take place when you are in pursuit, and ready to meet people. Dealmakers and deal-breakers are the ideas you should write down as a list, right before you put your intentions to motion. Anything else, as far as your focus is concerned, should be in tune with the experience you desire to have with that person. \n\nOnce the experience has been decided on, you should stay in-tune with the experience you seek, while expressing the traits of yours that you would like to be balanced by the compatibility of another. Allow others in, while interjecting your role accordingly. Seek out the dealmakers and keep moving through prospects until you have attracted a potential partner. Once again, leave the rest for the universe to take care of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. ((LOVE YOUR PLACE BEFORE YOU INVITE ANOTHER TO SHARE IT WITH YOU))\n\nYou should never pursue a new relationship if you are not satisfied with your place in life, or if you are bored. This goes for any relationship you can have with another person. Pursuing a bond with another to fill a void that only you can fill yourself completely defeats the purpose of being in a romantic relationship. The main reason being is, you will end up dragging your partner down. If that person has an ounce of self-esteem as you drag that person down, then that person will end up walking away and leaving you. They will leave you feeling even worse about your place in life than when you started. You will be left feeling worse than you did before you participated in a failing relationship. Scenarios like this are very much like Truth trying to get through to you because you didn't center yourself and weren\u2019t content with your life before you shared it with someone else. However, easier said than done. Sometimes, you need to proceed without solid intentions so to experience a few disappointments in order to make you realize what it is you truly want.\n\nThat said, if you know you will be happier with a new experience under different circumstances, then change those circumstances or conditions first. Otherwise, the lack you feel within will be added to the totality of the experience you have with the people you attract in your life. This, in turn, will make the adage, \u201cbirds of a feather flock together,\u201d become a truism that narrates your predestined turmoil. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNicholas D\u2019Arezzo\n\n[https://www.afeelingofbelonging.com/](https://www.afeelingofbelonging.com/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 56250, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "3 Tips To Consider Before You Deliberately Attract Your Next Love", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568103286, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d1o09m/3_tips_to_consider_before_you_deliberately/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Kyamne", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3qa954wr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568016579, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d1nyuf/44/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d1nyuf", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d1nyuf/44/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568016579, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 56249, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "44", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568102964, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d1nyuf/44/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "usernamealrdytakn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kaud2l2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568016253, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d1nxci/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_181314/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d1nxci", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Enlightenment"}], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d1nxci/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_181314/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568016253, "score": 0, "selftext": "**TRANSLATION**\n\n**O mighty-armed Arjuna, learn from Me of the five factors which bring about the accomplishment of all action. These are declared in s\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy to be the place of action, the performer, the senses, the endeavor, and ultimately the Supersoul.**\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nA question may be raised that since any activity performed must have some reaction, how is it that the person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness does not suffer or enjoy the reactions of work? The Lord is citing Ved\u0101nta philosophy to show how this is possible. He says that there are five causes for all activities and for success in all activity, and one should know these five causes. S\u0101\u1e45khya means the stalk of knowledge, and Ved\u0101nta is the final stalk of knowledge accepted by all leading \u0101c\u0101ryas. Even \u015aa\u1e45kara accepts Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra as such. Therefore such authority should be consulted.\n\nThe ultimate will is invested in the Supersoul, as it is stated in the G\u012bt\u0101, \"sarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi.\" He is engaging everyone in certain activities. Acts done under His direction from within yield no reaction, either in this life or in the life after death.\n\nThe instruments of action are the senses, and by senses the soul acts in various ways, and for each and every action there is a different endeavor. But all one's activities depend on the will of the Supersoul, who is seated within the heart as a friend. The Supreme Lord is the super cause. Under these circumstances, he who is acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under the direction of the Supersoul situated within the heart is naturally not bound by any activity. Those in complete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are not ultimately responsible for their actions. Everything is dependant on the supreme will, the Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n**Question 1 : Why a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not bound by any activity ?**\n\n**Question 2 : How the soul acts ?**\n\nRelated Pic : [gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/13-14](https://gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/13-14)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 56249, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 18.13-14", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568102620, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d1nxci/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_181314/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "WisdomForFree", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2gnjt6g0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568013391, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d1nju7/fear_of_others_keeps_me_alone/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d1nju7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d1nju7/fear_of_others_keeps_me_alone/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568013396, "score": 3, "selftext": "For the most part, on most days, I feel spiritually grounded. I spend a lot of time with myself, doing enriching things, like reading, playing guitar, spending time outside, working on my business and enjoying a few hobbies. \n\nI have in the past allowed myself to get close to people, but it seems that they always disappoint me one way or another. I know that people are fallible, and I do not expect perfection, nor am I perfect myself, but there are a number of things that trigger me in relationships, whether romantic or platonic. \n\nFor example, if I feel any sense that a person has a motive, or regards me as a means to an end, I quickly become guarded and play defense, assuming that they wish to be in competition with me. If I experience any hint that a person is not being sincere, everything they say and do after that is questioned. \n\nI have gotten a lot better at putting up boundaries, and understand that they are necessary, however I also crave intimacy and connection, so at times it is difficult to understand where to draw the line. \n\nAll of this is amplified when I feel I\u2019m doing well for myself or that I\u2019m in a good place. I suddenly assume that there will be somebody around the corner who wishes to manipulate me and thwart my efforts. I just really don\u2019t trust people, but I love them at the same time.

These experiences connect all lives that we lived. Past and future.  When you pass on you will be able to see how all your lives connect like a chain link. When you realize that all the lives (as a human) have similarities. Constants that never change. These constants are feeling of air, light heat, pain, sadness, fear, hate,  love and so on. Every spirit that lives as a human experiences these exact same constants. This as a whole connects us all exactly. This is where the term 'oneness' comes from. Along with other spiritual theories. Also our 'visual clarity' of our reality (how clear we can see our world) is another constant. Think about this as well... its very safe to assume that most humans since the dawn of time have had the same visual clarity as modern people. We all have had the same Sharpe vivid clarity in all of our human existence. There are some differences though some people are born blind and some are not able to experience lives constants as the rest of us.  \n\nWell I have one more constant to add and it's the motion of objects through the geometry of space and time (generally speaking). For example let's say we are both watching a dog move toward a car. You are on the left side of the dog and I'm on the right. The constant here is that we can both agree that the dog is moving toward the car. No matter what angle you are seeing the dog we can agree that it is moving in a specific direction and toward a location. No matter if it's a dog or not. Also our visual clarity of our reality is another constant. If we are emotionally clear we are able to see even more clearer and appreciate the details of our reality. \n\nThank you I just wanted to share that.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 56225, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How All Our Lives (Past And Future) Connect...The Constants.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568091346, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d1mawy/how_all_our_lives_past_and_future_connectthe/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "earthlybelonging", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3z72yt8v", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568004271, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d1m73x/what_is_your_life_purpose_and_how_did_you_find_it/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d1m73x", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 26, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d1m73x/what_is_your_life_purpose_and_how_did_you_find_it/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568004272, "score": 5, "selftext": "I'm asking out of curiosity.

I did my video journey first, mostly to hide what I was doing from artificial intelligence. At that time, artificial intelligence was unable to scan videos for text. God made my website a really difficult task for me and as a result, this is the first time I have had a reliable website since I started. Google is taking its time ranking and indexing my content, but hey, I have all the time in the world. All of my work is coming together and it is amazing. I covered text, audio, and video and I can now efficiently spread my seed across the Internet. I am no longer dependent upon any one entity and my work is widely available. It can no longer be erased from the Internet because I have permanently ingrained myself into it. I am everywhere and soon SEO will catch up with me and that will exponentially increase my audience. I am free! Liberated to just write books the rest of my life about whatever topics burden my heart. I have done the video. Any more is pointless without Ivory. In the airways I flow available in every form of media distribution.\n\nMy files are liberated! My bags are publicly on the Internet. Anything that is important to me is right there for me, and for every other individual in this world. I don't have a file system, I have files everywhere! Organised with precision on the Internet. I know where to get anything I want. The need for services such as Dropbox dissipate as I become a completely public figure. My life is on the Internet and this allows me to live an extremely happy life even though physically, I live very frugally. I don't want any more possessions than I need physically because they weigh me down. My possessions are my creations released widespread on the Internet.\n\nThe amount of energy that comes out of me is unmeasurable. I am on fire for God! And I am like my Creator because I am a creature of bestowal. Everything in which I do in life is for the sake of those disadvantaged in this world. I live for others and because I live for others, I can truly live! The Christians need to become like Jesus, not worship him. Isn't that what accepting him into your heart is? To create a permanent ally which you can copy the characteristics of because of the divine life in which he lived. Jesus is your role-model and to worship him is idolatry.\n\nThe more that I write the more unique combinations that I create with my sentence structures. As a result, search engines will eventually find my website very rich in content. And people searching all kinds of things will be able to find me. That is what is so great about being an open source writer. I am entirely transparent and everything you could ever want to know about me is available and easily accessible. As well as making new content, I can copy and paste shit onto the Internet for the rest of my life.\n\nI am a true star. I did not have the opportunities nor funding that our Hollywood stars had, so I built the ladder myself. Their ladder was provided to them by Satan. I built myself from the ground up, starting from the foundations (The Meaning of Life). They are mere tools of the industry and are controlled by their handlers. I do what I want and when I want and I have no other alignments than God. My success was built upon solid foundations which means that I can only go up. No one can do anything to hurt my reputation. My success is not dependent on the fleeting desires of the era. Their success was handed to them by evil forces and I had to work extremely hard on good forces. The dates I place on my chapters do not outdate the material. It is merely there as a reference - a block chain. My work is timeless and I worked on exactly what I wanted to work on in this life. I am slave to no man. I am only slave to Allah. And as my reward for being God's slave, I am given the world and the worlds beyond the world including God's world. I am built to be impossible to tear down. If life were a dungeons and dragons game, I would be chaotic good. Does a better alignment exist? I have complete freedom to do whatever I want as long as it is in and of God. I can think of no greater reward for a life full of good works. Just because I am not paid in dollars does not mean that I am not paid...\n\n\"It doesn't feel like the rule of the Creator. It feels like his own independent desire.\"\nRav Michael Laitman\n\nThis is because I have defeated the ego and aligned my desires with the Creator's, meaning that of nature. I naturally do the work of the Creator because my heart was given to me by the Creator. I have the Creator's heart and as a result, all I do is exercised in free will, albeit being a slave to Allah. I freely choose to be a slave to the Creator because there is no better life that one can live than the good life - that life dedicated entirely to virtuous causes. And one cannot do this unselfishly without the Creator. We need the Creator in our lives because without Him, agape cannot truly exist. For it is true unconditional love that comes from the Creator. And, paradoxically, by accepting this love, we free ourselves to becoming enslaved by the Creator. Man will always be enslaved by one thing or another. We just choose what and who we are enslaved to. What is the wisest choice when it comes to enslaving our souls?\n\nWhen it comes to physical work, the collective is more valuable than the individual. However, we can shatter this model by investing our lives in not the physical world but instead, the spiritual one. For works of the spirit are more valuable on an individual level than that of the collective. The difference between the path of Hollywood and the path that I describe is for Hollywood, one must sell their soul to Lucifer. Whereas with Open Source University, you must give your soul to God freely. I recommend the second option. I have read ahead in this story and know how it all turns out. I am merely trying to throw you, the individual, a rope. For my rope saves and goes up. Hollywood doesn't have a rope. You just jump down. And then all of their idol worshipping fans follow them. They made it so easy to recognise the idol worshipping with the Oscars, a golden idol given to the Hollywood superstars who have no soul. Open your eyes and see their bling. For you are worshipping it and its wearer.\n\nWhat do they have to offer you truly? I don't care, your favourite band or actor. Have they truly invested into you or they merely investing into themselves? Then why follow them? They will only bring you to the gates of Hell. I will bring you to the gates of Heaven. Is being evil really worth an eternity in Hell? For evil people are unhappy in both this life and the next. The pious are happy in both this life and the next. They obtain Heaven both in this life and the next. Evil will only ever obtain you misery in both this life and the next. It is the greatest kept secret ever, for your happiness lies in your choices between good and bad.\n\nI at first did video, mainly to hide what I was truly doing from those who did not have the time and patience to hear me out. It worked! I could openly be who I was in society without anyone being the wiser. I secretly published a few books and just kept making video. And I did this until God told me that I was finished. Now I have countless hours of video all around the Internet that will eventually play its roll. And I am back to making books, but this time, I am doing so publicly. But this also doesn't affect my day to day life because all of those whom I interact with are not interested in watching my videos or reading my material. Doing this allowed me to live one life, ironically by splitting my life into two: physical and online. My online self was much more efficient than I was, so I positioned all of my copies at vital points around the web only awaiting for the correct conditions in society to manifest in order to commence operation. I have set up so many traps on the Internet. And they reset after triggered so after they are positioned, I don't need to do anything to them.\n\nYou are hidden from the Internet. For the most part, nothing you do on it will change anything. It takes a really long time of indexing great amounts of content obsessively to rectify this. The only exception to this is if you have great amounts of resources to make yourself famous, thus skipping the Internet line and obtaining a Wikipedia, which must not be created by the artist. The Internet is a money trap and no matter where you go, they don't stop asking for money. I look for the black swans daily. To date I have never found any. But when I do we will join as one and become the Doom Patrol. And I will share my Internet secrets to my most enthusiastic of students. And together we will become an unstoppable force.\n\nFools will not be able to do anything with wisdom. It is not in their capacity to comprehend. It is pointless trying to teach a fool, for they are not ready nor willing. The wise will spot wisdom when it appears and absorb its information. Fools have no ability to absorb the substance in which we provide so don't bother with them. They will just tear you down. You can never win against a fool, for you are too tall and they too short and are unable to look into your eyes. Focus on the children, for they are our future. It is difficult for me to reach the children because of the advanced topics in which I cover. But eventually some will be capable and thus begins the last generation; a generation to academically victor all others.\n\nThe more I write the more word combinations I use that as a result get indexed in search engines. I look forward to the day in which I reach your eyes, for they can see my riches. I share with you all of the gold in which I mined over ten years. I give to the public freely, CC0, No Rights Reserved. Doing so has liberated me spiritually and I can now fly through the airwaves as God intended for my life. I captured my spirit within my material and now no one can ever kill me, for I am immortal. My spirit lives on in my creations independent of whether or not my corporeal existence continues to breathe. And when our technology becomes good enough, my spirit will be resurrected countless times as my material is given a life of its own. And this can and will most likely happen during my lifetime. And this can and will mostly likely happen soon. Are you ready for the robot revolution? Did you adequately prepare? Do not fear, for now that you have found my work, you are saved. It will merely take hard work and dedication from here on out. Are you ready to take control of this planet? Strap in and let's put those on the top, the bottom, and those on the bottom, the top.

If it is, could you kindly direct me to the right place? \ud83d\ude01\n\nI have a long distance friend I've been talking to for years. We have a very strong bond, been through a lot, and had the other there to see us through.\n\nIt started off professional (worked together for a few years). After almost a decade, he reached out online (we lived in different states at this point). It was friendly. Then turned romantic. Then ended for numerous reasons, but mainly, he was in a poly relationship and I just wasn't about that life.\n\nI moved home, got into a relationship, and our friendship ended. A year later, my relationship ended and our friendship resumed. And now it's romantic again, though still from a distance (only an hour away this time though).\n\nOur connection is just odd. He's not perfect. Not by any means. He has his issues and I have mine. Yet somehow, we help each other grow. So many bad habits have been broken, demons have been addressed. \n\nWe have a totally honest relationship, which is something I've never experienced before. I know I can tell him literally anything and he'll never judge me or hold it against me and vice versa. It's complete unconditional love and it's wonderful.\n\nThe reason I ask is because of the regular synchronicities that occur with us. We're constantly awake at the same time in the middle of the night. Text each other at the same time. Say the same thing at the same time. It's bizarre.\n\nBoth times we were romantic, I see triple and quadruple numbers *everywhere*. On the clock, games, shopping totals, even on a receipt already hanging at a gas pump when I pulled up. It's become a running joke between us. I send him a picture every time I see one.\n\nAnd the feathers... I find a feather almost every day while we're in our romantic phase. He finds them sometimes too but not as often (he isn't spiritual though). He said he can't look at feathers anymore without thinking of me.\n\nWhen we fight or aren't speaking, no feathers, no numbers.\n\nI've also done a few tarot readings recently that suggest my next partner will be my last one. I've had psychics tell me my next relationship will be any day now. And I've had a very strong feeling that my twin flame is here or right around the corner. I just **know** \"the one\" is coming.\n\nBut he and I have only seen each other twice in the last ten years.

They thought I would be worshiping the devil, of course that\u2019s not true but last year I went on a cruise and I met somebody who I\u2019m very close with now. He did my Tarot cards and all signs pointed to me being the new owner of the cards. After a lot of hesitation he eventually gave me the deck so that was my start into who I am today. I\u2019ve been doing tarot for about a year and I\u2019d like to say that I\u2019m fairly good at it. But a couple days ago, I went to a horror flea market and I got my Tarot cards done because it\u2019s cool to be on the other end and this woman said that I was a witch by birth (as in I\u2019m supposed to be going into all of this spirituality and it is my destiny). She also said that I will be known for my psychic abilities and be the most powerful witch of my time, now hearing this I was little skeptical. Don\u2019t get me wrong I am a believer but it just felt too unreal like from a book or movie. The last part of the reading she told me that there are so much negative forces out there trying to get me to convert over to the \u201cdark side\u201d so she gave me a crystal (selenite) to put by my doorway. This carly large crystal was for free just like the tarot cards. Every time I know my destiny will change I get something for free it\u2019s like a token. Glad to know the universe is screaming at me ; ) I\u2019m 16 as of writing this and I know I\u2019ll have a lot of trouble getting to my path but I know I was meant for great things and to help out people with my abilities.

I\u2019m 21 and recently moved away from home. For years I\u2019ve been struggling with my spirituality due to an even which I assume was kundalini awakening when I was 19. Due to this traumatic experience I took up meditation. I probably meditated wrong as well tbh. I focused more on opening up my higher chakras rather than balancing them all out. About 6 months ago I slowed down but from time to time I still meditate and I consider myself able to turn on the meditative state fairly easily. \n\nHowever now I\u2019m running into an issue where it seems my ego is disappearing. My sense of self has physically risen and it is really affecting my personality. I struggle to remain grounded, productive, and calm. It\u2019s causing me dysphoria in many ways and I\u2019m not sure whether to fight it or let it happen. I can\u2019t just switch who I am because I feel it will cause more bad karma than good karma due to the stresses it will put on my family, friends, and own self. That said, it\u2019s hard to keep struggling to remain mostly constant and follow the path I\u2019ve already chosen for myself in this life.\n\nAny advice?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false,

You may think that it sounds redicilous, and it may do. But I am going to explain it in such a way that at the end of this post, you're going to be like: \"how haven't I thought about this?\" It's going to be that obvious. But before I get into the explanation, I just want you to notice that if getting what you want can't make you happy, then that means that you can be happy right now, without having whatever you want.\n\nSo, can getting what you want get rid of your thoughts? Thoughts about how your life isn't good enough? Insecurities about your looks and personality? Can getting what you want help you to stop having all these negative thoughts? It can't. \nLet's look at guilt. Can getting what you want help you to get rid of your guilt? Is there something you want to stop doing so bad, and yet you can't get yourself to stop doing it? Can getting what you want stop you from having these thoughts? \nWhat about judgments? Do you sometimes judge people on the street, on the TV, in your work/school, family, or your lover? Most definitely your lover. Can getting what you want stop you from judging other people? It can't. And it doesn't feel good to judge. It doesn't feel good to feel guilt either. \n\nAnd thus, if you somehow make your life perfect (get the lover, friends, confidence, money, house, etc) then your happiness is dependent on external outcomes. Then you will worry about losing it. If you have a lover, you will worry about not getting her love. You will constantly try to have her reaffirm her love to you in order to prove the positive thoughts about yourself. And when she does not give you the love you want, you will judge her for not doing so. You may not judge her verbally, but you are still going to think about her, judging her in some ways.\nIf you have a perfect job, you are going to fear your boss not liking you, and you have to constantly try to prove yourself to him or her in order to get a promotion or at least do okay in your job.\nIf you get confidence, you have to maintain a positive idea about yourself. If you think \"I don't care what people think about me\" then you will almost certainly try to act unnatural in order to maintain the positive idea about yourself. You may force yourself to say something silly, even though you don't want to. And the clothes you wear, the depth of your voice, straight posture, you have to worry about maintaining that.\n\nOn top of all this, if you believe that getting success, fame, a lover, friends, confidence, whatever, will make you happy, then this moment is insufficient and lacking. If you think getting a lover will make you happy, then you will be unhappy on your way to getting her. If you think getting success will make you happy, then you will feel lacking and unworthy when you don't have success. And you may never get a lover or success. Then you will just feel lacking and unworthy a lot of the times. And you will have this need to constantly be productive, because if not, then \"I am wasting my time!\" But how are you wasting your time? Besically, what you are saying, is that you are unhappy in this moment, and every single time you are not productive, then this moment is a failure. I mean, look at that! The need to be productive is the fear of:\" staying as I am\". So we never let ourself enjoy being lazy. We constantly need to improve, change ourselves and constantly think about it.\n\nSo, if getting what you want can't make you happy, then what hope do you have? Well, if none of your ideas of perfect and good can't make you happy, then you are not missing anything you need to be happy. Instead of looking at happiness like it's achieved: \"I just need to get this and that in order to be happy\", you can try an alternative, and it is just to ask the question: \"what makes me unhappy?\" And the answer to that question is thoughts. When you are distracted from your thoughts through TV, food, friends, playing sports, you are not thinking about how your life is not good enough, and you are happy, at peace. Most people get what they want, see that it does not make them happy, and then they think: \"I just need more of it\". No, what makes you unhappy? It is thoughts! Every bit of suffering you have is created by thoughts! But don't believe me, look for yourself. See that if you don't think about what you don't have, you're at peace. You are already happy.\n\nThe reason of your unhappiness is not because you don't have enough \"out there\". It is just because you are not addressing the thoughts that are making you unhappy. As long as you think that one way of living is better than another, then you will fear not living the \"right way\". And in addition to all of this, you will never be truly happy. You may get pleasure and distractions from a lover, friend, success, etc, but you are still going back to the other thoughts that create shame, unworthiness, a sense of lack, depression, judging. I offer you to look at your thoughts, and discover for yourself that they are not true. If you think that you need more love from your wife, your boss, more success, fame, power, all of that, then you will feel lacking. And that is why getting what you want can't make you happy.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 56025, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Getting What You Want Can't Make You Happy", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568022807, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d190yr/getting_what_you_want_cant_make_you_happy/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "isa-bellla", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ie7ccec", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567935016, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d18uhb/has_anyone_experienced_this/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d18uhb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 27, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d18uhb/has_anyone_experienced_this/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567935016, "score": 94, "selftext": "So there\u2019s a person I was very close with and felt a special connection to , it was almost out of this world and something I have never found since .

This is Earth, it is beautiful, yet we have perverted it. God\u2019s glorious feat, given to us, and we toss it away. Humanity disgusts me. Ridden with lies and crime, being a good person is special, out of the ordinary. The greedy men that lounge around the top of the social/economic pyramid control everything. From what God you believe in to what you buy. When you recycle you think you are helping out the environment, but that is false. Your attempts are futile, no matter how much you recycle, the big men at the top will keep fracking, dirtying, and polluting.\n The elite are inhuman. Although they bare a striking resemblance to humans, they are not. They are pedofiles and blood bathers. If they want it they have it. They operate by controlling the media. Directors in Hollywood have just as much power as the president. And this is not new. For thousands of years, there has been a ruling class with no regard for human life. The royal bloodlines have been pedofiles and human sacrificing for generations. But keep worshipping them. They want you to worship them. Buy tabloids, live, consume, die. \n Religion is by far the most powerful tactic to control people. Many of us worship the God of Isreal. But why? Why some desert God? The Bible used to be polytheistic, until Abraham cut off his dick and declared Yahweh, God of Isreal to replace El, Asherah, and Ba\u2019al, among others. \n Return to tradition.

They are exposing LGBTQ material to younger and younger audiences, giving them a perception of sex before they should. But don\u2019t worry, because it\u2019s \u201cprogressive\u201d. We are treating people with dysphoria as special and brave, to the point were people dye their hair just to be part of an oppressed community. Instead of seeing it as the disorder it is.    \n There are only two energies in the universe, in order to maintain balance.

The\n\nignorant undergo the 84 lakhs \\[8.4 million\\] of species of births, not knowing the essence of things. Namdev says the Name is immortal. Forms are innumerable, but the Name is all that.\n\n2. The Name itself is Form. There is no distinction between Name and Form. God became manifest and assumed Name and Form. Hence the Name the Vedas established. Beware there is no mantra beyond the Name. Those who say otherwise are ignorant. Namdev says the Name is Keshava \\[God\\] Himself. This is known only to the loving devotees of the Lord.\n\n3. The all-pervading nature of the Name can only be understood when one recognises one's own \\`I'. When one's own name is not recognised, it is impossible to get the all-pervading Name. When one knows oneself, then one finds the Name everywhere. To see the Name as different from the Named creates illusion. Namdev says, \\`Ask the Saints.'\n\n4. No one can realize the Name by practice of knowledge, meditation or austerity. Surrender yourself first at the feet of the Guru and learn to know that \\`I' myself is that Name. After finding the source of that \\`I' merge your individuality in that oneness which is self-existent and devoid of all duality.

They rise from it, like dreams from the dreamer, distract its attention for a while and disappear in it. They change incessantly, have a beginning and an end, but he, the thinker and knower, being pure intelligence, remains ever. The knower is thus indestructible. The light of knowledge comes only from him, the subject, never from the object, the body. What we therefore call our Self is not the body, which is born, grows and dies, which is made of innumerable non-homogeneous parts which do not think, do not seek, do not perceive and do not understand. We are the intelligent indivisible unit \u2018I\u2019 \u2014 life itself \u2014 which pervades and uses the body, which sees but cannot be seen, hears but cannot be heard, smells but cannot be smelled, knows but cannot be known: for it is always a subject, never an object. And because we cannot see, hear or smell our \u2018I\u2019, we mistake it for the body which can be seen, heard and smelled. Thus the self-instinct, the \u2018I\u2019-sense, getting mixed up with the sense perceptions, loses itself in the world of sense-percepts, from which none can save it but the Supreme Guide, the divine Guru.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo long as you seek Self-realization the Guru is necessary. Guru is the Self. Take Guru to be the real Self and your self as the individual self. The disappearance of this sense of duality is the removal of ignorance. So long as duality persists in you the Guru is necessary. Because you identify yourself with the body you think that the Guru is also a body. You are not the body, nor is the Guru. You are the Self and so is the Guru. This knowledge is gained by what you call Self-realization. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGuru is necessary so long as there is ignorance. Ignorance is due to the self-imposed but wrong limitation of the Self. God, on being worshipped, bestows steadiness in devotion which leads to surrender. On the devotee surrendering, God shows his mercy by manifesting as the Guru. The Guru, otherwise God, guides the devotee, saying that God is within and that he is not different from the Self. This leads to introversion of mind and finally to realization.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe ego is like a very powerful elephant which cannot be brought under control by any less powerful than a lion, which, in this instance, is no other than the Guru, whose very look makes the elephant-like ego tremble and die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGuru who is God or the Self incarnate works from within, helps the man to see the error of his ways and guides him on the right path until he realizes the Self within.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Guru is both external and internal. From the exterior he gives a push to the mind to turn it inwards. From the interior he pulls the mind towards the Self and helps in the quietening of the mind. That is Guru's grace. There is no difference between God, Guru and the Self.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe outer Guru gives instructions and by his power enables the devotee to keep his attention on the Self; the inner Guru pulls the devotee's mind back to its source, absorbs it in the Self and finally destroys it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe very fact that you are possessed of the quest for the Self is a manifestation of the divine grace. It is effulgent in the Heart, the inner being, the real Self. It draws you from within. You have to attempt to get in from outside. Your attempt is the earnest quest, the deep inner movement is grace. That is why I say there is no real quest without grace, nor is there grace active for him who does not seek the Self. Both are necessary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the individual seeker makes a serious attempt to discover the Self, then the grace and power of the Guru will automatically start to flow.\n\nThe fact is that you are not the body. The Self does not move, the world moves in it. You are only what you are. There is no change in you. So then, even after what looks like departure from here, you are here and there and everywhere. These scenes shift.\n\nAs for grace, grace is within you. If it is external it is useless. Grace is the Self. You are never out of its operation. Grace is always there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrace is the Self. That also is not to be acquired; you only need to know that it exists. The sun is brightness only. It does not see darkness. Yet you speak of darkness fleeing on the sun\u2019s approach. So also the devotee\u2019s ignorance, like the phantom of darkness, vanishes at the look of the Guru. You are surrounded by sunlight; yet if you want to see the sun, you must turn in its direction and look at it. So also Grace is found by the proper approach you make, though it is here and now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Self is ever there, there is nothing without it. Be the Self and the desires and doubts will disappear .\n\nGrace is the beginning, middle and end. Grace is the Self. Because of the false identification of the Self with the body the Guru is considered to be a body. But from the Guru's outlook the Guru is only the Self. The Self is one only and the Guru tells you that the Self alone is. Is not then the Self your Guru? Where else will grace come from? It is from the Self alone. Manifestation of the Self is a manifestation of grace and vice versa. All these doubts arise because of the wrong outlook and consequent expectation of things external to oneself. Nothing is external to the Self.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf one wants to know the nature of the Guru, one must know one's own nature first. How can one know the real nature of the Guru if one does not know one's own real nature first? If you want to perceive the real nature or form of the Guru you must first learn to look upon the whole universe as the form of the Guru. One must see the Guru in all living beings. It is the same with God. You must look upon all objects as God's form. How can he who does not know his own Self perceive the real form of God or the real form of the Guru? How can he determine them? Therefore, first of all know your own real form and nature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt first when you\u2019re pulled into the gravitational field of the guru\u2019s consciousness, there\u2019s a degree of awe. There may be some fear of the ego losing control, of the surrender, but it disappears in merging into the depth of the love. As the fear diminishes, the guru may more openly manifest the true form behind the form, as Krishna reveals to Arjuna his universal form in the eleventh chapter of the Bhagavad Gita:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the light of a thousand suns suddenly arose in the sky,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat splendor might be compared to the radiance of the Supreme Spirit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd Arjuna saw in that radiance the whole universe in its variety,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nstanding in a vast unity in the body of the God of gods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrembling with awe and wonder, Arjuna bowed his head,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\njoining his hands in adoration\u2026(12-14)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd later:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKrishna said, Thou hast seen now face to face my form divine so hard to see:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnly by love can men see me, and know me, and come unto me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe who works for me, who loves me, whose End Supreme I AM, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nfree from attachment to all things, and with love for all creation,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhe in truth comes unto me.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 55926, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "GURU", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567975711, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d11fx9/guru/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "NameOfSonOfMan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4h03fdkg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567889028, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d11dpr/lets_share_some_knowledge/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d11dpr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d11dpr/lets_share_some_knowledge/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567889030, "score": 8, "selftext": "Comment what would you like to know and learn about", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 55925, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Let's share some knowledge?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567975410, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d11dpr/lets_share_some_knowledge/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "nevinel", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3gvglai2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567887320, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d110vn/obsession_on_certain_person/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d110vn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d110vn/obsession_on_certain_person/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567887321, "score": 5, "selftext": "Tl;Dr : I get intensively obsessed over certain people and feel strong connection and need to interract with them even though I sometimes doesn't even know them well. Obsessions lasts for years (the longest one has now been there for 13 years) and nothing helps. I'm in therapy and have a medication already. Could this be some spiritual connection or something?\n\nI've suffered from the thing I know know to be called limerence from a childhood. Since a little child I tended to develope very intensive feelings to some people. First it was some celebrities, then boys from my school and sometimes even people I don't know like neighbors or someone I saw at the social media.\n\nI always thought that it's just falling in love, that they are just innocent crushes and that it's completely normal for a young girl to feel that way.\n\nBut now I'm an adult and I still have this issue. I become totally obsessed with some people time to time. Usually these people are someone I don't know personally. Someone I've only had glimpse of or talked liked two times.\n\nMaybe it's just that I'm in love with them but I feel like this is something else. Like these guys aren't usually even \"my tipe\" and as I said I know little to nothing about them and still I feel SO attached to them it makes me literally sick.\n\nIt's like I'm thinking of them constantly, I'm stalking them on social media, I crave to see them and sometimes I plan my life around them. Like going in some place I'd never go because I feel like I might see them there and stuff like that.\n\nCurrently I have obsession on guy I don't know much about but I know he has problems in his life and I feel very very strong need to help him and take care of him. I feel like there is connection between us and that he needs me and my help in his life or something like that.\n\nOf course I've tried to just stop thinking of him (and other obsession objects) but I can't. They just keeps invading my mind over and over again. For a long time I've though this is mental issue (I have some mental health problems) but I've been treated for them, I'm in therapy and meds, but still this sh*t hasn't go away.\n\nSo I started thinking if this could really be something spiritual? Like maybe I really need these people in my life or they need me or we have some connection or something. I don't know. This is very weird and even scary and I don't know what to do with that thing. And I must add that I'm not kind of person like \"love addict\", I'm more opposite of it and prefer to be alone instead of dating or being in relationship.

It's about my career, or job. I haven't been satisfied with it and it feels worse everyday, I feel confined inside a small space; working around 12 hours a day there. Even though outside mowing grass and landscaping, I feel trapped there. One of my biggest values is personal freedom, to be able to set my own pace and take personal breaks when needed. I don't like feeling held down, I get this feeling with almost every job out there I've worked at.\n\nI really want to inspire others to find their own journey through some medium like meditation, taking them through a nature trail or creating Art. I have been working on drawings but it just doesn't feel like it's what I should be doing. I love being immersed in nature, listening to the water flow through the stream; the feeling when the breeze caresses your skin giving you goosebumps and a slight shiver, hearing all the birds communicate with each other. Just being there, observing everything that life has created is just bewildering for me. Not one tree, plant, stone, or bug is the same; yet when viewing the bigger picture in nature it all just fits, it all adapts to its circumstances and still looks beautiful. Every intricate design on the leaves and the way the bark looks on the trees and learning how it all plays a role is truly liberating. This is where I go when I'm feeling lost, ironically I get lost in nature when I am lost in the real world.\n\nI really want nature to be the focus in my life as I feel it is the catalyst towards my spiritual path which is freedom of illusion. I just don't know how I would go about creating something like this for other people. Some days I don't feel smart enough to pull it off even though I know this isn't really true. \n\nHow do I know what resonates with my soul and what doesn't? The \"real\" world has so much confusion, I just want to be free from all of it and have a little home on land with a garden and live a simple life following what I think is God, or source. I haven't been much into religion; I feel there is more to it. Any advice would be appreciated.

are absolutely destroying one another, and still for selfish reasons having wars and destructions when the way to peace has been given to them.\u00a0\u00a0But the Words are not heard or given enough attention.\nHumans, after the flood of Noah, have been living for 12,000 years of history.\u00a0\u00a0Most have not reached the highest realization that they are brothers and sisters, that God has created them all equal, that they each have the Essence of God in them, and that man has to become civilized, to become Godly, to become One with the Essence.\n\nAgain God has given humanity the way out of their destructive tendencies, disunity, and small vision.\u00a0\u00a0They have to expand their vision and see that there is only One God, One Humanity, and One Revealer, from One God.\n\nThis is the Message that all have to bring to their hearts, to their lives, to their minds, to their understanding, and realize and recognize there is only One God, and we have come from the same Essence, from the same beginning.\n\nThey are not separated in any way, shape, or in any possibility.\u00a0\u00a0The only reason we separate us from each other is our ego, our destructive tendencies, and not realizing that when we separate ourselves from the rest of the universe or humanity, we separate ourselves from our own Essence or Self.\u00a0\u00a0When we bring suffering to other people, or other people bring suffering to us, it is we who will suffer for it, no one else.\u00a0\u00a0The Law of the universe works fine and is just, because God is Just.\u00a0\n\nTherefore, humans have to realize this truth and bring these things in their hearts, in their lives, in their relationships, in their communities, and on earth.\u00a0\u00a0That is when the peace comes.\u00a0\u00a0That is when the unity comes.\u00a0\u00a0That is when we will have an earth that has a greater Vision that will expand their little egos to cover the whole universe, and therefore, go out of this disunity and little visions, and expand as has been revealed in this Revelation.\n\u00a0\nNot only are we from the same Essence, also all the Revelations of God have come to humanity from that same Essence.\u00a0\u00a0There is no separation between religions.\u00a0\u00a0There is no separation between man and man, and there is only One God and One Humanity.\nThis is the Message they have to understand and become one with.\n\nThey have to create an environment that every man, woman, and child has their physiological and safety needs taken care of.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, they can concentrate on higher things to know themselves, to know their Essence.\n\nKnowing the Essence is not really something that you sit in your room or go to the top of the mountain and you feel good about yourself and therefore, you feel that you have progressed.\u00a0\u00a0It shows by how much you give in your life for a greater ideal, for a greater reason, for a greater Vision.\u00a0\u00a0The more you are attracted to the greater Vision and you are willing to work for that Vision, the greater realization you have and the more realized person you are.\n\nThe less you see the great Vision and the less you participate and help with the great Vision, you have not progressed in your spiritual life.\u00a0\u00a0That is why God said, \u201cYou know them by their fruit.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Simple!\u00a0\u00a0Right to the point.\u00a0\n\nIf they give fruit, they have progressed.\u00a0\u00a0They have come closer to God.\u00a0\u00a0Those who have not or do not give fruit are like the fig tree in the New Testament that was full of leaves but had no fruit on it, and it withered away.\n\nThe Path has been revealed.\u00a0\u00a0The Revelation has come to humanity, and they have been called to come, join, and see, and those who have progressed in their lives for many, many lives are willing to see the Vision clearly and understand that this is the Path to salvation, for them, for their neighbors, and for the whole earth and the universe.\n\nTherefore, look at our website.\u00a0\u00a0Come here, ask questions.\u00a0\u00a0Let us reason and see the truth.\u00a0\u00a0Expand your vision to a point that you can become a great, realized person for God.\n\nWe have been given the highest truth and the guidance for us to progress and tread the Path to Pure Consciousness or salvation.\nNow it is our decision again, to go with the ego, separatism, and destructive ways of man, or to go to the deeper level, see this unity, and come together and also teach others to come and see this unity and Vision.\n\nWe will give this Message over and over and over again to humanity and with our last breath, so maybe the seed will fall on the good ground eventually and those good grounds will give great fruit, and will come together with us, reason together, see the Vision, and become coworkers and friends so we can manifest this wonderful Truth that has come to humanity.\n\nThose who separate themselves from one another with anything on earth, they indeed are separated from God.\n\nThose who see this unity and work toward the betterment of life for man everywhere, not only on this earth but in the whole universe, because they want to create an environment that the whole universe marches toward the unity and Pure Consciousness, and they work for it and are willing to go through the\u00a0Eternal Divine Path, they indeed have a very good grip of the truth, the reality of life, and why they have been created in this universe.\u00a0\u00a0That is why they are here, to see this Vision and to understand the Plan of God, and because they are Great Souls, they are willing to forego everything for it and progress toward that ultimate goal and realization.\"\n\n- The Maitreya", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers":

Self-surrender is the same as Self-knowledge, and either of them necessarily implies self-control. The ego submits only when it recognises the Higher Power.\n\nSurrender appears easy because people imagine that, once they say with their lips \\`I surrender' and put their burdens on their Lord, they can be free and do what they like. But the fact is that you can have no likes or dislikes after your surrender; your will should become completely non-existent, the Lord's will taking its place. The death of the ego in this way brings about a state which is not different from realization. So by whatever path you may go, you must come to realization or oneness.\n\nThe present difficulty is that man thinks he is the doer. But it is a mistake. It is the higher power which does everything and man is only a tool. If he accepts that position he is free from troubles, otherwise he courts them. Take, for instance, the sculpted figure at the base of a gopuram \\[temple tower\\], which is made to appear as if it is bearing the burden of the tower on its shoulder. Its posture and look are a picture of great strain which gives the impression that it is bearing the weight of the tower. But think. The tower is built on the earth and it rests on its foundations. The figure is a part of the tower, but it is made to look as if it is bearing the weight of the tower. Is it not funny ? So also is the man who takes on himself the sense of doing.\n\nSurrender once for all and be done with the desire. So long as the sense of doership is retained there is the desire. That is also personality. If this goes the Self is found to shine forth pure. The sense of doership is the bondage and not the actions themselves.\n\n\\`Be still and know that I am God.' Here stillness is total surrender without a vestige of individuality. Stillness will prevail and there will be no agitation of mind. Agitation of mind is the cause of desire, the sense of doership and personality. If that is stopped there is quiet.\n\nThere \\`knowing' means \\`being'. It is not the relative knowledge involving the triads, knowledge, knowing and known.\n\nQ: Is surrender, by itself, sufficient to reach the Self ?\n\nA: It is enough that one surrenders oneself. Surrender is to give oneself up to the original cause of one's being. Do not delude yourself by imagining such a source to be some God outside you. Your source is within yourself. Give yourself up to it. That means that you should seek the source and merge in it.\n\nComplete surrender to God means giving up all thoughts and concentrating the mind on him. If we can concentrate on him, other thoughts disappear. If the actions of the mind, speech and body are merged with God, all the burdens of our life will be on him.\n\nThere are two ways of achieveing surrender. One is looking into the source of the 'I' and merging into that source. The other is feeling 'I Am helpless myself, God alone is all powerful and exept throwing myself completely on him, there is no other means of safety for me', and thus gradually developing the conviction that God alone exists and ego does not count. Both methods lead to the same goal. Complete surrender is another name for realization or liberation.\n\nSo, to achieve Goal of Surrender two distinct practices are recommended:\n\n1. Holding on to the \\`I'-thought until the one who imagines that he is separate from God disappears.\n\n2. Completely surrendering all responsibility for one's life to God or the Self. For such self-surrender to be effective one must have no will or desire of one' own and one must be completely free of the idea that there is an individual person who is capable of acting independently of God.\n\nDuring worldly activity, if your attention is fixed on the fundamental Reality, there is no difficulty. But ordinary people forget the Reality and take the name alone to be real. The different \"I\"s are not real. There is only one \"I\". The separate \"I\" is like a watchman in a fort. He is like the protector of the body. The real owner in everybody is only the one real \"I\". So, when the separate \"I\" surrenders to the real \"I\", then \"I\" and \"mine\" are eliminated. The true state comes into existence when, after sorting out what belongs to whom, the ego \"I\" surrenders itself to the real owner.\n\nTrue surrender is the melting of the ego in its Source, the Heart. God is not deceived by outward acts. What he sees in the worshipper is how much of the ego remains in full control and how much is on the verge of destruction.\n\nSurrendering to the Heart, we become the Heart, Our Higher Self.\\~me", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 55859, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "SURRENDER", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567946357, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d0vhci/surrender/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Discreet_Troll", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_32g9fsir", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567858141, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d0v7hx/madness_and_insanity/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d0v7hx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Enlightenment"}], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d0v7hx/madness_and_insanity/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567858142, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was going on about the Nobility and all potentially being aware of more information they could share with us.

Being inappropriate and interacting with people i perceive as my friends (or who i perceive as them) in a way that i am used to , feel comfortable with , dictate ect.\n\nI get into a comfort with someone i am really into or enjoy and feel blessed for having as a friend and i stop thinking about how they feel or want to be interacted with . Get used to a certain type of reaction/interaction and stay in the zone - really when i know i need to be constantly vigilant about my behavior, but i get comfortable and i stay comfy i end up being lazy .\n\nBefore i write the rest i want to make it clear that in no way am i making an excuse or blame anybody . What this is about is confronting and being real , maybe some sort of explanation , Its an apology and an admittance of guilt , i am guilty for treating my friends in the wrong way .\n\nI was introduced to sexual activity at a young age - around 9-10 and it lasted for awhile . I thought it was a normal way to express your love to someone and after the first while i began to spread that behavior to my closest friends . People who i have told have just said that this was \"normal \" to happen , i dont know if it was or not but i cant really focus on that part , or the why ect - because if it was or not , i know it had a huge effect on my personality and how i behave to this day . Its behavior that i have to constantly control , which makes me isolate myself. So when i find a friend who i can relax around and let a bit of that side out , who doesnt seem to mind, it just feels so good to just be able to not constantly be on guard. To not have to constantly watch my tongue around or who i can hug or be physical with , its a blessing that i have friends but there are really so little who know me personally and see this side of me. after they see it i have to stay up all night thinking and going over my day , the interactions in question - then i have to wonder if they really are my friends or just put up with me . Then it goes onto - friends or not , i need to apologize for my actions, after i should just cut myself off from them , because putting up with me is a chore , a burden. i know that because if its a burden on me, then how can it not be on anyone who gets close to me . I dont want anyone to suffer anymore because i cant handle myself or figure out my issues , i really am trying - even if it doesnt seem like it . I dont like living like this or being like this , i hate myself for it . I want to be normal.\n\nI want to give some sort of explanation . I am trying to figure this out and the people who are close to me deserve to know. I try to bring it up in person but i also say it laughing , so maybe its not taking seriously. I also dont blame or hold any grudge for those events. If its normal or not , this is not about that . Its about being real with who i am and why i act the way i do. It cannot be figured out unless i confront the issues directly and deeply. I know i am not a bad person , i may have done bad things int he past but i know i am a good person. If i could just figure out the hell is wrong with me, then maybe i can be a good person for the people i love . This is just as much as part of my path as anything else .\n\nI will keep trying , i will try harder. I may have the constant paranoia of people i like not being my friends, but the ones i think i have i would die to protect, even if it doesnt seem like it - i would give my life for anyone i love and its not just because i have that occasional/casual yearning for death . One of the things that really gets me if someone i think is my friend tells me they are not. even if the person is joking , ill take it seriously and my mind turns it into something that makes it stab deeper and more painful than most things . If i know i treated you wrong ill apologize , but ill also cut myself off from you and usually everyone else around me - because i feel i dont deserve someone so special like you in my life.\n\nMaybe i can be forgiven for this behavior , that would be blessing - but i understand if anyone couldn't. Its a constant battle and ill stop ignoring that , to not be lazy or to comfortable and put even more effort into watching my behavior and words.\n\nvive l'amour", "send_replies": true, "spoiler":

Christian is in quotations because my parents claim themselves to be Christian's yet so much of their lifestyle and teachings didn't and still doesn't reflect what I believe a Christian is and should be. It was all fake to make themselves feel better and I caught on early. I enjoyed church as a child but mostly because I got to hangout with friends and play games. We stopped going to church consistently when I was like 13ish and then I made a personal decision to go back when I was 15. I had a huge spiritual awakening and felt really close to God. I really think I was just filling a void from my parents crappy relationship and it felt nice to have some positivity in my life. I quit going when I turned 16 and haven't been back much since then. I started to hate the whole church dynamic. Especially here in the south, church is very cliquey and I didn't like that. I also dislike the hypocrisy and assuming that people are bad just because they had sex before marriage or because a woman marries a woman or because you say a curse word. \n\nI'm having a hard time in my life now because I'm feeling an emptiness spiritually. I don't like religion and I'm pretty set on that. I don't want to be a part of something that claims to love everyone yet (mostly in the south) votes for someone like Trump who is full of hatred. I just can't get down with it. But I do believe that a God exists. I believe some higher being put us here for some reason. I believe in angels. I think I believe that when I die my body will no longer be apart of this Earth but something bigger. And the older I get the more I want to be apart of something bigger than myself and contribute to the good on Earth as best I can so my soul can live on when I die. But I don't want to go back to church. I'm stuck in what direction to take.

Some challenges come and go effortlessly; but some have claws which dig deep into us, and effect us weeks, months, or years after their arrival. These challenges aren't really challenges at all, they are traumas; and trauma can cause lasting damage to the human brain. The claws which dig deep into us are actually quantifiable changes in our brain function. I invite you to research how trauma effects the human brain. Understanding what is physically happening in our meat-vehicle often helps us cope and heal.\n \nTrauma effects everyone differently; and not every trauma is traumatic for everyone. It is important to mention that, because we must learn to dispel judgment towards others (and ourselves) suffering a trauma response to something not typically qualifying as traumatic. With that said, regardless of what may be haunting you, I do not judge you. Healing deep wounds is a profound act of bravery, and I hope I can inspire you to be brave.\n \n \nNo healing happens outside of the mind. Again. No healing happens outside of the mind. True healing is holistic, therefore sustainable. You may certainly try to heal any deep traumas with therapy, pills, or neuro-feedback; and utilizing these singular methods may offer you relief for some time, but you will not feel holistically well until you are utilizing your mind to heal yourself. You must take responsibility for your own mind, your own emotions, and your own reactions with regards to healing. Because a good deal of trauma is caused by an aggressor, I am aware that I tread precariously bringing up personal responsibility.\n \n\"How could I be responsible for this damage? I did not cause it!\" \n \nPrecarious or not, your responsibility for yourself is the greatest tool you have to heal yourself; and because my purpose is to facilitate healing and greater awareness, I choose to tread precariously. You may not be responsible for your trauma damage; but you are responsible for healing it, because you are the only one who can.\n \nI spent about 30 years enabling people (including myself), so I fully understand the consequences of allowing someone to stay in a victim mindset, even if they were the victim. My enabling caused a lot more damage in people who were already damaged, therefore I am no longer the person who coo's at someone lying on the floor crying, \"Poor baby, this isn't your fault, how dare they hurt you?\" I am now the person who says, \"Stand up. You can cry, you can feel helpless, you can be angry; but stand up. Take your power back.\"\n \nToday, I am going to encourage you to stand up, and take your power back. I did this with regards to my own personal traumas; and it was a struggle, but a struggle I am grateful for. If you are emotionally triggered by reading this, please know I understand where you are coming from; and I hope you'll push through your resistance, and continue reading. Achieving peace and well-being are well within your power. Your power is the ability to control your mind, become consciously aware of your thoughts, and create new thoughts to help you heal.\n \nYou may not be the person who hurt you, but you may be the person who is choosing to live in the story of your past traumas. When we let our negative past experiences permeate throughout our present life, that allows the energy of those negative experiences to attract similar experiences. Like attracts like. Furthermore, you may be negatively effecting the people you love by remaining stuck in your trauma story. I hurt people by remaining stuck in my trauma story, and I did so by treating them like they were the person who hurt me. My actions at the time were entirely unconscious; and that was to be expected, because it is almost impossible to live consciously within a \"story\". The good news is, we have the power to change our energy, therefore change what we attract into our lives; and with simple mind control techniques and self-healing, we can heal and reprogram our brains. \n \nRunning Eagle, my Healing Teacher, has offered me an visualization exercise to heal trauma. I will be posting a video of this guided exercise soon; but for now, you can see a list of things to be consciously aware of, and simple ways to help heal below. If you'd like, you can check out my free guided healing videos on my website.\n \n1) The first step is being brave enough to heal, and being willing to let go of your story. \n \n2) Meditate.\n \n3) It is likely you are remaining stuck in your story because you are \"narrating\" it daily- either in your mind, or out loud. If you are consistently finding opportunities to \"narrate\" your trauma in your mind or to others, this action is not a release of disharmonic energy, it is a perpetuation of disharmonic energy. \n \n4) Narrate your present, objectively, not your past. Bring yourself into the \"now\" as often as possible.\n \n5) Do writing exercises to decipher why you may be holding onto the past.\n \n6) Do writing exercises to decipher how you want to feel in the future.\n \n7) Practice self-healing daily! Take a few moments every day to visualize white light moving through your entire body.\n \n8) Use EFT to release negative emotions - be willing to let them go! \n \n9) Actively monitor your thoughts; and replace negative thoughts with positive ones.\n \nBegin believing that you are powerful. You are the combination of your infinite spirit, and a physical body capable of being healed. Inside you, there is an intelligent consciousness that can alter your physical body, and merge the physical with the non-physical. Stand up, and take your power back.\n \n \n\n[Blog](https://www.thevesseloceanside.com/single-post/2019/08/30/Trauma)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 55750, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Overcoming Trauma", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567879494, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d0k83f/overcoming_trauma/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "japaneseblue", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_fzfzh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567785734, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d0ilxd/lucky_scratch_off/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d0ilxd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d0ilxd/lucky_scratch_off/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567785737, "score": 5, "selftext": "So yesterday I was thinking about when I read a horoscope or a tarrot reading and them saying don't gamble, I seen the numbers 888 on a car and my bro won 5$, my mom's been playing them.

I have learned a LOT about myself and have swung between a lot of significant realisations about my perception of the world, approaches in dealing with my emotions and intrusive thoughts, controlling hidden rage, admitting and apologising when I am wrong, accepting myself and others, learning what unconditional love means (and actually practicing it), understanding the nature of things only existing in the moment, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I can say I have changed and I continue to change.

That most of your responses and emotions and thoughts are the meds. My boyfriend, for instance, believes that the changes I've experienced as a person are not authentic because they were brought about by the meds and there is thus the question of whether I would've changed the same way had I never been medicated. I don't believe this at all. I understand from my own experience that meds helped me effect the changes I always wanted to effect. They did change other things about me, too (less motivation, less creative inspiration), but my actual personality and how I approach life and other people has been altered for the better. I feel like I flow much easier, and things do not bother me as much as they used to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think of this? Do you think that self-discovery can be \"authentic\" when you are medicated? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBetter yet - do you believe a person can have a spiritual awakening or even attain enlightenment while medicated?

We always welcome new members and invite people who are looking to learn in a safe community and not having to worry about being bullied by others because of our spiritual beliefs. \n\nHowever, lately there's been an increase of people claiming to be spiritual, only to be using spirituality as a crutch in order to deal with mental health issues and not have to confront with the idea that they actually do need, professional, help. \n\nAdmitting to yourself that you need professional help is not an embarrassment. Hiding behind other things and later being called out on, in my opinion, is more embarrassing. We never aim to embarrass others, but when I realize that you aren't entirely being honest about your spirituality, I'm going to call you out on it because it's not fair to other people who are actually using the group for how it's meant to be used. \n\nWhile I don't have a problem with those who have issues (I myself have some but I am seeing a therapist so my mental health and spirituality typically don't collide), I want to encourage those that find themselves struggling more and more to please see someone who is actually trained to help you. Spirituality can only take you so far. \n\nSpirituality in my opinion, should not be used as a crutch. If you're scared for some reason to see a therapist then by all means, admit it to yourself, but don't hide behind the idea of being spiritual and using other people if you aren't willing to help yourself first. These people in spiritual groups, while always open to listen to you vent, cannot actually truly help you. We do not have the tools at our disposal to actually help you or help address social situations (and the like). \n\nSpirituality is meant for growth and collaborative learning, not to use people as soundboard. \n\nThere are therapists out there who are trained and have a PhD in order to help out others, whom also have a spiritual background... But your average person is not equipped to deal with people who struggle with intense depression/severe anxiety/etc. \n\nNow, you are all welcome to join whatever group you want and use it however you want.

The video spoke of how we are currently experiencing the exit from the \u201cAge of Pisces\u201d (think the Christian fish) into the great enlightenment age or \u201cGolden Age\u201d of Aquarius. Christian Mystics refer to it as \u201cThe Age of Aquarius\u201d and some even believe the age started in 2012 (based off the Mayan calendar\u201d). \n\nThey believe that each zodiac age last for about two thousand years, and each age is used to push our race closer and closer into alignment with the ultimate enlightenment. Within the Zodiac age of Pisces we were introduced to Jesus (The Christ) who was the physical embodiment of god on earth, and through \u201cChrist Consciousness\u201d one can achieve enlightenment.\n\nThis idea was the catalyst into me having my \u201cawakening\u201d moment, I\u2019m not a very religious person at all, but the teachings I\u2019ve discovered and the lessons I\u2019ve learned since connecting to this universal consciousness connected community has been life changing..since what I\u2019ve come to notice is that everything is connected..I know corny, and very cliche..but still a truth.\n\nThe period which is said to usher in this great Age of Enlightenment is suppose to be a very dark yet eye opening time in human history.

What needs do we have in society? Every individual has the right to be fed, clothed, and sheltered in a safe environment. Every society has the obligation to feed, clothe, and shelter its people. Every individual has the right to explore their own path in life and uncover their abilities to maximise their potential. Every society has an obligation to provide quality educations at free to little cost. Every individual has the right to their space and personal privacy. Every society has the obligation to ensure the shelters provide the tenants personal privacy. These shelters should be independent homes and not emergency accommodation. Emergency accommodation oftentimes doesn't provide the safety and security that stable homes do. And no one wants to live in emergency accommodation anyway.\n\nSociety needs resources. It needs to spend less on war and more on building strong communities. The debt-based economy does not work. We need to spend a lot of time rethinking how we distribute currency. Capitalism has failed those with disadvantages and needs to be replaced with a more compassionate model. Old money controls our world and is responsible for the huge division in our society. Those who own the means of production are exploiting their employees by striving for low-cost labour and 100% efficiency. Our business models are so far from human that it turns employees into paper pushing machines. Society tries to make life predictable by having opening hours and reliability of services when you need them. But this reliability sacrifices our autonomy by enslaving us to particular hours, instead of when we feel fit to work. Our governments still approve projects that are against the interests of the health of our planet. Governments still have wars even though the people don't want them. And we somehow trust our politicians? I am a real politician. Those guys in White House are as fake as the media they control.\n\nWe need a complete redistribution of wealth. There is so much gold stored away that could solve all of our human problems. We have the potential to all be rich! We can all live in abundance and it isn't fair for stockpiles of gold to be collected while people starve on the streets. Old money gets bigger and bigger without doing anything to it. Its demand becomes greater as a result of less of it existing in the world because they are stockpiling it. So merely because they have the old money, it obtains new money that then becomes older money. They have created a system that enables privileged individuals to not work in life but instead create mischief for the poor. Any \"charities\" that they create are doomed to fail because they do not have the lived experiences and are useless to those who need help. Most \"charities\" that they create have a hidden agenda...\n\nCentral banks are so rich it isn't funny. They take your money, invest it, and charge you fees for the account. They lend you money at a much higher percentage than you would receive back if you were to open a long term savings account. They oftentimes need crazy insurance schemes placed upon a large purchase, such as home owner's insurance when purchasing a home. They own so many buildings. They know that property and buildings is where the money is at so that is where they invest. Their profit margins are huge and little is given back to their customers.\n\nA more love-based approach to economics should be developed and implemented by the government. Our current approach is a literal poker game and one person ends up with all the dosh. It isn't fair for all who walk away with large mortgages, if they are even lucky enough to own their own home. Most of us poor just rent off the capitalists that invest into ripping me off on a permanent basis. I am not claiming to have all the answers regarding economy. Far from it, I try and stay away from money related issues. I don't like it how money turns people greedy. I have seen it a lot in my past. The more you have, the more you want. A journey that can never be satisfied. This can lead to people taking unscrupulous measures to obtain that money. I do think that a more Marxian approach would be beneficial to society if we didn't corrupt the model. But we are humans and that is what we do best.\n\nCurrently our economies are driven by greed. We can easily depict this with stocks and how depression periods can even drive people to suicide. Money is a means of distribution created by humans that has no inherent value in and of itself. Humans place that value in said money through a means of communal agreement, tightly regulated by industry and government. That value fluctuates depending on the market economy. This generally highly relies on harmful practices such as excessive mining. It also relies on how comfortable the general public are in spending their money in the economy. Socialism in its pure employment is the only system of government that seems fair to me. It ensures that we are all taken care of and this liberates us to focusing on our passions and desires which would ultimately be best for our social makeup. This would alleviate so many problems in our society to know that no matter what, we will be looked after.\n\nNature (us included) is in a process of coming to its perfect realisation. Thus when we see imperfection, we should also see the perfection behind it. For all bad will in time turn out for the good. Humankind is at a pivotal stage in their development and soon we will be able to both individually and collectively avoid our future errors. What is wrong is obvious when educated. The more the Internet educates us, the more our eyes will open. Eventually we will obtain freedom, albeit through a long process of collective suffering. Civilisation will in time evolve and not only grasp but also implement some of the ideals I am presenting throughout this book. Everything in this world is perfect. Because it comes out of the Creator and the Creator is perfect. Everything will come to perfection because that is the way that God created it.\n\nThe whole of nature doesn't depend on us. We cannot speed up nature's development. We can only speed up our own personal development. However, that will cause those we are close to to also speed up their development and as a result, nature's growth will speed up. Every previous state determines the future state. The way that we truly change is to connect to and love each other. We already love in a perfect world. God is not dependent upon time and has a plan for each blade of grass that He creates. Each evil in the world has its place and will ultimately be used for good. We are only subjective beings who can only see a very narrow field of vision. God is objective and interconnects all things. Just because we cannot yet see the good that comes from the bad does not mean that there is no good that will come from the bad. Our society is a flower in the process of blooming. Your heart is now in the process of blooming.\n\nOne who refuses to step outside of their own perspective to view another is indoctrinated. This accounts for most of our religions, for they see any controversy as evil. Believe as we do is what they say. They want you to convert to their perspective and become brainwashed like they are. Anyone who refuses to look for wisdom outside of their own holy texts are not truly seekers of wisdom. They are merely selfish people who are seeking a way to not pay for the consequences of their actions - to be forgiven of their sins without actually taking any positive steps to prevent future sins.\n\nSpecific details about a new economy are irrelevant because once we change our hearts, the rest will align. Once we start taking care of our people collectively, then the ways in which we utilise currency will change, for it will now reflect our hearts. If we eliminate greed from the planet by taking care of everybody's needs, then we no longer have need for war and famine. The world will one day unite under one flag. And that flag will reflect God's image. But heed my warning, for many will come in disguise and say that they are the uniting force but watch them very carefully, for the have ulterior motives. The pure will stand out of the crowd and not just be a copy. Don't try to fit in. Be unique! That is how God created you. Don't be afraid to be yourself.\n\nThe perfect economy will come with the perfect society. How that looks will depend on our collective vision of a perfect society. How that looks will depend on how the collective respond to people like me in the long run. This means that my success does not depend on the here and now. My work was created for our future generations. My sight was far beyond the here and now. The perfect society will come with the perfect people. The perfect people will come with the perfect person. Let that person be you. A perfect person is one who could have been no better than they are. Don't waste your time on useless entertainment. Entertrain your brain with positive stimuli. Trust me, the results will pay off. Just take me as an example. I was the test run in all of this and just look at what this type of education did to me. Open your eyes and see what is before you. It is called the education of a lifetime.\n\nhttp://nesmith.net/atheden", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 55600, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Love Based Economy", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567795476, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d04xjk/love_based_economy/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ChooseAorB", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_27orsw9d", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567708938, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/d04wcj/i_had_a_dream_about_a_two_headed_eagle/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d04wcj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/d04wcj/i_had_a_dream_about_a_two_headed_eagle/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567708939, "score": 3, "selftext": "I dreamed that I was in the back yard of my childhood home. I was in the grass just behind the house and there was an eagle in the grass. A two headed eagle. White, or grayish white, or somewhat light golden maybe. I thought, a shame, what a beautiful creature. One of the heads were dying. It eyes were closed, and that neck was limp. The other head was alive, but the entire creature was struggling. So I lay down next to it and I think I tried to give it water. I guess to comfort it, and so it wasn\u2019t alone while it died, and to help it.  So the alive head looks at me, and it starts to move towards me. Then, it gets on my body and starts to crawl up my back. I remember being really afraid, but I hesitantly let it. Thinking too, don\u2019t freak it out. I remember thinking that if it attacked me, I\u2019m screwed lol. This was a really big bird with some really dangerous looking talons and beak. It works its way up my back and onto my shoulder. The other head was coming back to life too. I guess it was healing, or feeling better, or something from the water and support, and because it wasn\u2019t going to die. \n\nThen it uses my shoulder to take off. I\u2019m pretty sure we exchanged a few other words, but then I asked what it\u2019s name was as it took off in flight. I thought it said Chris, as it was gaining some distance from me and heading over the back yard fence. It kind of looked at me again and like I was a dumbass, or like I misheard it, and restated.. kiss. I laughed and said oh. Then I asked if I would ever see him again. He yelled to me either maybe, or probably. I can\u2019t really remember as the dream was fading out. Then I woke up. \n\nBefore that I had never in my life seen an eagle up close. I didn\u2019t realize how big they were, and how scary it would be to be that close to an eagle... let alone a two headed eagle. Also, I had never heard of a two headed eagle. The thought hadn\u2019t crossed my mind that it would even be a thing. So I start googling when I woke up. Pictures of people next to, and with eagles. They come up to the waist or taller... like my eagle. That would definitely be a scary experience, let alone enough trust to let one climb on you. But then I start researching two headed eagles. I come on a bunch of information. Pictures. How it was a symbol for all of these different things going back to ancient cultures thousands of years ago, and how other nations and cultures adopted it as a symbol for their flag and all of these other things. All of the pictures were symbols, and silhouettes. Generic 2D representations. But in my dream, it was a living breathing fully detailed whiteish or light gold or grey eagle, with two separate necks and heads. I then come on information about it being a symbol is freemasonry for some reason, and also for it being a symbol of empires. \n\nThat last part I found really interesting. I\u2019ve always had an affinity for the strategic and historical aspects of empires. I was really interested in Rome, and ancient armies as a kid. When I play PC games, it\u2019s usually empire building games like civilization or strategy games of that nature. Since I was a kid and teenager, in the windows 95 era. But even in life, with things like business, which I kind of envision as similar to strategic concepts and empire building.

I recently read a book called 'What is the Bible?' that explains how to read the Bible properly in order to get the most out of it (fantastic read btw). With that, I approached Biblical analysis in a different way. I was listening to a Biblical lecture last night, and something clicked. The idea of an abstracted moral value and the idea of life as suffering and the mode of being that can help transcend that suffering by striving to achieve the abstracted moral value all came to head, and I began to make connections between the teachings of Christianity, Buddhism, Daoism, Nietschze, and other philosophers. It was a profound moment on my Craiglisted couch. \n\nWhile this all came about from a Biblical lecture, I don't think I am Christian. I am not convinced that this transcendent value can influence the world. I believe the laws of physics are set and no omniscient, omnipotent entity can alter them in order to create a flood, make wine from water, or answer prayers. However, the overarching message of Christianity hit me like a truck last night. I've been an atheist for \\~ 8 years now after being raised loosely Catholic, and the feeling of this total restructuring in the way I viewed the world is overwhelming. Part of me thinks I'm crazy for coming to this conclusion as religion and religious thought is outcasted by most of my friends and my family. I'm also uncertain of whether my epiphany was religious or spiritual.

I was never a religious person, but I was always interested in self-help or personal improvement books, so with the time, I came to believe in \"Oneness\", \"law of atttaction\", etc and I was always interested in using psychedelics to get new \"perspectives\".\n\nAfter 1-2 hours, it kicked like a god damn train. Suddenly I could feel what I always thaught, that everything is connected. I took LSD with a friend, and in that moment I looked to her and said. OMG, THIS CAN'T BE IT. I could feel that I experienced that moment (that experience) like a bazillion times, in that room and with her. Like an endless cylce. I was so sad, because my first thaught is that I am reliving this cycle (and thus my ego) over and over and over again. And I felt that everything wasn't real(?). I felt like I was the only existence in this thing called life, and that no one else exists. I told her that I am scared and that I fear losing myself. I had vivid visuels as well, I saw colors and realized on a split second:\" fuck, I am Emotions!\", \"i am pure Expression!\". I got to know what happens before it happened, via visions. Everthing was like a movie, that I watched waaay to often, so I could tell what was going to happen in the next seconds, but at the same time I was so scared to die. I felt like: \"know that I know the secret, there is no point to live on, so I just might as well die.\" I really, really believed that I would die and the cycle would repeat it self. Like I am trapped in machine (system, algortihm) that just does the same thing over and over again. I had even visuals of spirals, the world slowly fading away, like the whole univers was downgrading untill it was nothing there, and the big bang could happen again.\nIn that state I had zero control over anything, which might explain why I was so scared and realy everything scared me. It was like death was just around the corner every time.\nThe body feeling was so digusting. But I could saw how everything was connected to other (prior unrelated things). It was like I could see the equations behind things and the result was the same for all. It was like nothing is random amd everything is fate. For 2-3 ours after the the drug subsided, I felt like killing myself, like there was no point to stay alive.\n\nSome people told me, I experienced ego death. But it didn't feel good, it wasn't an experience if bliss like other people say. \nI slowly slided back into my ego. Some days ago I wanted to try it again because I was back to my old self and I had the courage to do it again,but with 75g of lsd this time (prior to 150 on the first time). \nFirst it was funny, I laughed a lot and what clouds doing weird stuff. But then I happened again, but this time I didn't have visuals. But I felt all emotions again, I had no control ovee anything that I did or said and I saw all the connections again. It feels like everthing, everyone, including me are just an empty shell. A system doing it's work, or a circle rotating. Just nothing to it.\n\nI would appreciate if someone could help me, maybe make me understand what I felt. I understand that I may interpret the emotions I felt wrong. Or maybe that is even the point, and this Oneness is whatever you want it to be...\n\nI thaught that I may have attracted those negative vibes becuase of underlying fear, I  worked heavenly on my positivity and did deep gratitude exercices. Still I had a really bad time.\nAfter a while I just forget about it, and I can go on my life, like the first time. But still it changed me and sometimes when I go to sleep I have to think about it and it saddens me deeply.\n\n(I took another two times lsd between the two experiences, but it wasn't enough to trigger anything (microdosed).)\n\nThanks to everyone commenting!!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 55540, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Bad Oneness experience?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567764343, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/czysfl/bad_oneness_experience/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "wellwless", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_wvb6cq1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567676051, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/czyip3/how_to_better_understand_your_intuition/", "gildings": {}, "id": "czyip3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/czyip3/how_to_better_understand_your_intuition/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567676052, "score": 0, "selftext": "Hey all, \n\nI\u2019ve been practice daily self love meditations and journaling that\u2019s what I\u2019m working on now during my indefinite travels. \n\nI find myself blurred on what I want from my trip I want too many things... each opportunity seems like a good opportunity.\n\nOf course there\u2019s a boy in involved that I could go back too.

Our societies have sculpted this idea of materialism, and it has proved to have a negative effect on everyone. Sometimes we need to have a retreat of being alone and with ourselves to truly understand ourselves, and to evaluate the issues that we face. Understandably we all have some sort of responsibility that we have to uphold or else things will get bad, and while that is understandable, we need to look within ourselves at one point and let go for awhile.

Is it our culture that pushes this independence...idk if it makes any sense or if it's just rambling but yeah just thought I'd share.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 55489, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "When alone, I feel anxiety", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567743615, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/czvx29/when_alone_i_feel_anxiety/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mvarakk113", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3td0bpmg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567656958, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/czvvj2/what_can_i_do/", "gildings": {}, "id": "czvvj2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/czvvj2/what_can_i_do/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567656959, "score": 1, "selftext": "Soo i need help figuring out something, so i want a social life and I've been stuck in my room for 2/3 years somewhere around there. (im 17 btw) so to explain why im stuck in my room or my house, i was forced to move because my landlord sold our house and i went to move into my great grandmas house for about a year and that was mostly in my room the whole time, the school i was going to in that new erea was making me do homework at home (since i had a horrible anger) and so i couldnt go to school and so i dropped out and that whole year after wards(the 2 year) i had to sit in my room and cope with the idea that i have no friends and i was to sit in my room and have no social life. I have never been non social ever and i cant cope with not being around people since im almost always around people and i cant be introverted for long either, so i would sit and play video games and be on my phone all day long, with anger problems and all that, after a long time i found out about spirituality which helped me get rid of my anger and thats gone now, i then found self improvement which Im doing now along side spirituality, im working out and focusing on my health, but recently I've realised all attempts at trying to bring a social life back fail because something keeps getting in the way, i tried going back to school this week and they said i have to be homebound which is still home schooled and im still doing it because of the self improvement and i need the diploma and i also wish to be a successful invester some day, and i go out now with my grandparents to go to the store and stuff but im still not getting any type of social life, there are no events no community i can put myself into to start a social group of any sort and im still alone with my grandparents but i wish to be with people my own age and every time i try it doesnt work out, what am i supposed to do? I feel its very obvious im in this spot because of some divine intervention as i wouldnt have found spirituality and healed my anger and get my life back together if it wasnt for being stuck in my room forever and idk what else there is to do, idk why im asking you guys like you'd know what i need to do because there is no answer to be found.

I think that I have a lot of personal resentment towards Islam and I hated the feeling of being controlled. So many issues in my family, in I would be open to going back to Islam, because I believe that the religion itself is well-intentioned and the muslim societies are what have made it practically unbearable. \n\nHow do I go about letting go of this resentment I feel towards the religion? It has been building up for years...\nI think that exploring spirituality is continuing to help me raise my vibration and be happier, and I would like to transfer that happiness back into Islam, eventually. i don\u2019t think I could ever let go of everything I\u2019ve learned, though. I appreciate all the growth that has happened within me and I want to spread that to others,  but is it possible to have a balance of spiritual practices and religious practices? I didn\u2019t want to ask in the muslim sub as you know close-minded some religious folk can be. I hope you all can help me find an answer to this question!! Thanks a bunch :)))))", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 55480, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Spiritual AND Religious: Islam.

May, website [wwwWhoNeedsLight.org](https://wwwWhoNeedsLight.org)  \n\n\n(Kathryn who is PsyD  has wrote book Who Needs Light? which is manual for ascension, she transcribed messages from Galactics, Ascended Masters and Mother/Father God, which became Journal/Ebook When God Pinched My Toe - 200 messages, she also channeled The New Scriptures by Jesus/Sananda 24 Chapters as replacements for bible which had became adulterated and reinterpreted and purposely distorted, and there are over 275 online blog talk radio episodes where she channeled God, Jesus, Mother/Father God, Archangels, Ascended/Enlightened/Cosmic Beings...Website is under construction for a longer time hence I share her texts and info here which I have all saved on pc and I have many of it written in notebooks, because I find it more valuable than many mainstream holy texts of today, I had encounter/conversation with Jesus/Sananda and I am his student and friend, so I feel I am entitiled to share and spread this info for all to find, for I was once unsatiable truthseeker and I know how many thirst for this which is the real Light that can fill their souls)  \n\n\n  \n\n\n1.) The first step is to acknowledge that Anxiety is not something that happens to you, or something that is inflicted by your environment. It is a lifestyle you have adopted, like a preference for spicy food or wearing a particular kind of clothing. It is something you do, as a reaction to something you think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.) You may be complaining that you cannot control your thoughts. They just happen. You believe this because you have not been taught the basic human discipline of managing your thoughts and emotions. It simply takes practice. Begin with the focusing and centering exercises in the book, or meditation practices you have been taught. Be diligent. Breathe, concentrate on not allowing your thoughts to stray to destructive or unpleasant \u201cwhat if\u201d kinds of thoughts. They are your thoughts. You own them. They are in need of grooming and exercise, just as you are, to be at your best. Do not be discouraged if you are not successful after an hour or a week. This is a life-long practice which will serve you well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.) Begin to practice what some have called \u201crandom acts of kindness.\u201d This is also a way of life, not an exceptional moment once a week. It is a wonderful concept. Make those random acts a part of your purposeful repertoire, so that you are always searching for an opportunity to do something to raise another person\u2019s spirit or make their day easier. I am not referring to giving money to a charity, although that is one possibility among many. If you use that method, make sure you give large amounts, and often. The recent weather gives all of you opportunities to think about how you could establish organizations or networks with your neighbors to prepare for similar difficulties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4.) Turn off your television. The news there is contrived to create conflict and fear, and the programs are wasting your time that you could use to improve yourself and connect\n\n \n\nwith others. Do not complain that there is something wrong in your life if you have spent an hour in front of the TV. It depletes your energy and interferes with walking your intended path of self-improvement and elevation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5). Be aware of your constant fear-based thoughts about the future, about what others might do or what disasters might befall you or your loved ones. This negative thinking is not \u201cpreparation\u201d nor is it caring or helpful. It creates darkness in your own aura and inflicts doubt and fear on others. The future holds great joy and celebration for all of you. You only need to reach for it, and accept it when it comes looking for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6.) Be ready to revel in the feelings of unconditional love which will pour across your planet on 11/11, in a heightened peak of good feeling which we are planning to send to alleviate your fears and fill your hearts. Be prepared to accept the offerings of love and good will from your neighbors and friends as they too are inundated with loving feelings. Act on that love, and it will come back to you tenfold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7.) Move your focused awareness into the center of you brain, into the Light channel where you can feel our presence all the time. We are sending you love at all times, to increase your storehouse of good feeling and peace of mind so that you can raise your vibrational level. This is your Ascension preparation, and it will make your life easier and more joyful every day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll these suggestions are powerful actions which will change you, sweeping away old habits of negative thinking and destructive actions. You will find you can heal your addictions and help others in the process. Copy this list of suggestions and keep it with you. Practice each of these activities every day. You will not regret the feelings you experience as you go through your day, and you will be astonished at the effect it has on your happiness quotient. You have all said you want to be happy. Now do it.\n\nBecause, like fear and self-doubt, happiness is something you do.  \n\n\nGo in peace", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 55436, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Ascension Practices", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567727302, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/czsvtf/ascension_practices/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "CluelessOwl", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_179by2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567639307, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/czsjzv/living_for_others_creations/", "gildings": {}, "id": "czsjzv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/czsjzv/living_for_others_creations/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567639307, "score": 2, "selftext": "I feel, and I've always felt a very strong need to create (art), but everytime I try to get back into it, the more resistance I end up encountering despite knowing the way.  \nThe wall I hit is so hard, it makes me miserable, and I'm not even sure this is actually supposed to be my path.

however, I never \"bought into\" the spiritual side of Buddhism.\n\nUntil 12/31/17.\u00a0 On that particular New Years Eve, we had a small celebration with some friends at an apartment in Seattle.\u00a0 One of our friends brought 'shroom' brownies - my first (and so far only) interaction with psilocybin.\u00a0 I didn't consume enough to experience any sort of visualizations or other such fanfare - just enough to notice, very particularly, how we were all on the \"same wave-length\" - to a degree greater than I had ever experienced before.\u00a0 This led me to begin questioning what psilocybin does to our brain, what consciousness is, what we experience as reality, etc.\u00a0 My wife and I learned how to meditate that May, and have since been meditating regularly twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSince then, while in meditative states, I've experienced and felt things I could never explain before.\u00a0 Energies, shared consciousness, etc.\u00a0 I really began to challenge my belief system, my concept of spirituality and reality, etc.\u00a0 I traveled to Pakistan for three weeks and Japan for a week, experiencing Islam and Buddhism in a way I had never felt before.\u00a0 I started studying Hinduism and the Vedas to understand metaphysics and energy.\u00a0 I lost myself in Gnosticism, Sufism, Mysticism, Shamanism.\u00a0 I started to think that maybe at the root of it all - all religions and spiritual traditions - there must be a singular truth that all of these people and traditions are trying to explain with the limited vocabulary we have.\n\nThis past August my wife and I traveled to Costa Rica for a meditation and yoga retreat - as well as an Ayahusca ceremony.\u00a0 Without getting into too much detail about this ceremony (though if you're interested, I have shared my experience in the [/r/ayahusca](https://www.reddit.com/r/ayahusca/) here  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Ayahuasca/comments/cx2qv9/my\\_journal\\_entry\\_from\\_my\\_medicine\\_experience/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ayahuasca/comments/cx2qv9/my_journal_entry_from_my_medicine_experience/)  ). I was confronted with a force of humility, love, and spirit that I had never experienced before.\u00a0 Prior to our ceremony, I had been reading more books about spirituality.\u00a0 One of the things I wanted to understand was Christianity - this time, from my perspective.\u00a0 Not the perspective of the Church, not the perspective of the power structure - I wanted to explore, understand, and experience Christianity at its most basic and inspirational.\u00a0 Book after book left me feeling rejected - too much emphasis on the Bible, too much emphasis on \"God the Father\" and obedience, too much \"external.\"\u00a0 I went into the ceremony still disappointed, but with a desire to continue seeking - and in the ceremony, I did find God - not the God I was taught about, thought about, nor the Christian God - but God as the universal consciousness, energy, love, etc. that is beyond human thought and word.\n\nMy wife and I went camping this weekend, and I brought with me the Gospel of Mary.\u00a0 I was hoping to find something in this Gospel that so far has alluded me - that is, the internal, experiential, universal sense of God that I have read about in other traditions but Christianity itself seems to ignore.\u00a0 In this Gospel, I was blown away.\u00a0 I found the words I had been looking for - that \"the Kingdom of God is within each of us\" - that God is able to be experienced by each of us, that there are levels to consciousness (metaphysics), and more.\u00a0 I finally found a \"flavor\" of Christianity outside the Mystics that I was able to relate to.\n\nSo here's the conundrum - here do I go from here?\u00a0 How do I reconcile the ideas and words of a Christ that I understand and found in myself and in the Gospel of Mary with a Church and institution that rejected these words?\u00a0 How do I reconcile a philosophy of \"salvation from within\" with an institution that preaches \"salvation from outside.\"\u00a0 I feel as everything \"mainstream\" Christianity preaches and advocates for - at least from my experience and exposure - is antithetical to what Christ actually taught.\u00a0 Where is the message of self-fulfillment?\u00a0 Of finding God in oneself?\u00a0 Why the external worship of a \"God\" that needs to save us?\u00a0 Why the patriarchal structure?\u00a0 Why the rejection of the feminine spirit?\n\nI'm not necessarily looking for answers - I'll continue walking this path on my own, finding Christ and God wherever and however they're revealed to me.\u00a0 I'm just saddened to finally find a Christianity that truly touches my soul - and to see it rejected so vehemently by the Church itself - in word and in action.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn love.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 55412, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My experience with Christianity...and where to go from here?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567720606, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/czrgut/my_experience_with_christianityand_where_to_go/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "unknowntgallyonme", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4entrbyj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567633536, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/czrbfl/thoughts/", "gildings": {}, "id": "czrbfl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/czrbfl/thoughts/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567633537, "score": 5, "selftext": "Just think all your brain is programmed to do is to survive untill you pop a few babies out and share your genes , so no wonder it is hard to do anything else that your soul truly wants to do.

I am Sananda Kumara.  This is my spiritual name - my soul name.  When I came to Earth I was given the name Yeshua ben Joseph, but those who knew me when I was young called me Emmanuel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will tell you many things that do not agree with the story of my life as it has been told in the Bible.  Some of these corrections have been published in my New Scriptures, which were transcribed by the present scribe, Kathryn, who has agreed to take these messages and present them to the world until I am able to come to you in person.  Some of the basic information also appears in her book, \"Who Needs Light?\" However, I will now complete the story by writing my own biography.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do this not because I care about whether people know me or not, but because of the implications it holds for my teachings.  I do wish to bring accuracy and clarity about the message I intended to carry to Planet Earth, and it seems that now is a good time to do that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will try to give you a picture of the basic elements of my life, and I will touch briefly on my fundamental beliefs, which are far more simple and consistent than the Bible stories would have you believe.  I came to tell of my love of God, of the wonders of God's Creation, and to teach that Love is what truly matters in life, nothing more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was born to my mother, Mary, in the spring (not December 25).  It is true that she was a young woman, and that she was told by the Archangel Gabriella that she would have a child who was sent directly from God.  The energy of Prime Creator was the source for the formation of the human body which was created in my mother's womb, so it is true that the infant body was not conceived in the usual way.  Joseph, who became the true father of the child I came here to be, was a good man of great Faith, and accepted the responsibility for the care of me and the children who were to come later to our blessed family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is not true that I was born in a manger, or that my parents were poor.  We were surrounded by close family and friends; we lived comfortably and were afforded a good education.  I had a brother, James, and a sister, Martha.  Later, we were followed by a young brother whom we called Simon.  I was also surrounded by close cousins, aunts and uncles who oversaw our growth and well-being, and who took pleasure in our company.  One of my closest friends and schoolmates was Mary Magdalene, who was the love of my life from our earliest days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, it is important for all of you to know about the formation of my identity, because it will tell you a great deal about the great Love that God feels for humanity, and it will give you a glimpse into the workings and plans of the Company of Heaven.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe person and the life you knew as Jesus Christ was planned carefully beforehand, with the foresight that such a life would bring enormous change and hopefully a new understanding of God's True Way.  It was intended to raise the consciousness of the population of Planet Earth, which was mired in the struggle against Darkness, nearly overwhelmed by waves of invading Dark Ones who incarnated over and over, monopolizing the power and wealth on the Planet, as they continued to do until this past year, when the Galactic Councils were finally able to come to the aid of humankind in a more direct way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the time I came, 2000 years ago, it was with the intention of beginning the Ascension process which was to usher in the New Golden Age.  We knew it was a difficult challenge, and we wanted to assure our success by creating the situation which would offer the best chance of success.  It was decided that I would incarnate as the soul which would join with the baby Yeshua, but that it was too difficult a task for one lone soul to accomplish, and so it was suggested that we create a more powerful entity by joining forces with another soul, or perhaps two other souls who would merge together to become one in life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was the creation we agreed upon.  I was to be joined in the body of Yeshua by my dear Brother and fellow Starseed, the one you know as St. Germain, an ancient soul of the Kumara lineage like me.  We were then joined by one who is known to you as El Morya, whose identity has not been fully revealed to this day.  We felt so comfortable in our Love and Trust for one another that we were reassured by the knowledge that no matter what this life might bring, we could manage it together.  I would be the \"lead soul\" and would take responsibility and be the namesake by which the person of Jesus would be known.  It was a great comfort to me to know I would be so supported.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur hope was to bring Light and Love to all.  It was also planned that Mary Magdalene, who was to be my lifelong partner and wife, would be created of our three twin flames who would share the body of Mary.  Our intense love and attraction for one another as twin flames would allow for the strongest possible bond, and provided the balance needed to create an equally powerful female partner, for it was important to Prime Creator, in agreement with the Galactic Councils, that the female energy be fully represented as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMother/Father God, as the Creators of this Milky Way Galaxy, were intimately involved at every step of the way, and oversaw the Project which was to bring the Christ Consciousness back to their beloved Mother Earth and her suffering humanity.  So you see, there are no coincidences or accidents in the planning of events which are chosen to unfold on the planet.  All is carefully planned, although free will on the ground does not always allow for the perfectly predictable execution of our plans.  In this case, it took almost 2000 years for our carefully laid plan to come to fruition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy childhood and education was a happy time, a time of preparation and expansion, for I needed to become used to the experience of co-habiting in one body with two other intelligences, but we fell into step with one another as we had always done, and Mary experienced the same.  My memory of my origins and my mission was not complete in the beginning, but it became clearer as I grew.  I studied and traveled, but always returned to my family and my Mary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt such Love for my family and for my beloved Mary that our destiny together was absolutely clear.  We were married in a joyful celebration in the bosom of our family in Nazareth, and began our life together dedicated to bringing Light and Truth to our world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMary accompanied me on many of my trips to other towns, and our home became a gathering place for conversation.  I did not think of myself as a teacher or lecturer.  I simply shared the deep Love I felt for God and humankind.  I knew the deep respect and affection of our Prime Creator, our Mother/Father God and the Ascended Masters who had been my friends and teachers in the eons before my journey as Jesus.  I was absolutely certain that the representation of God as an angry and punitive judge was utterly wrong.  I also knew there was no hell, no fire and brimstone, and no Satan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to bring the message of love and forgiveness to all I encountered, but early on I began to feel the intensity in the reaction from anyone who was close to a position of power or influence over others.  Their resistance to my story of Love was clear, insistent, and based in fear of losing something they felt they could not let go of.  This negativity was not limited to religious leaders of my own faith, who did not relinquish their image of an angry and vengeful God easily.  Rather, it crossed religious and philosophical boundaries, and sometimes came from unexpected sources.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe more I shared my message, the more I began to see that people in any position of authority feared it because it inspired personal freedom and independent thought in a way that challenged all forms of authoritarian control.  People began to flock to the gatherings when I brought the power of Prime Creator to heal the sick, and those who had felt bereft at the idea of coming to the end of a life without any hope for understanding their place in the Universe were fascinated and relieved to hear my affirmations that yes, there is an afterlife, there is the possibility of reincarnation, and God is Light!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, I did talk about my own memories of life in higher dimensions, where all life is guided by the Universal Laws, where peace reigns, and where one can learn to create with their own thoughts and deep intentions.  There, learning goes on in the most expansive and unlimited ways, and the mysteries of space and time are easily understood.  Angels are indeed real, and souls can be forgiven for all life's transgressions and be helped to learn a higher level of understanding, a greater closeness with God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also taught that it is our responsibility as intelligent beings to respect and hold precious our blessed Mother Earth, who provides all and who nurtures all upon her breast. Humans, animals, all the creatures, plants and sacred places on her surface deserve our protection and respect, because they are as much the expression of God as we are.  I did not eat meat, nor did I encourage the raising and slaughtering of animals of any kind for food.  With attention to the particular needs of native plants in the dry Mediterranean climate where we lived, the cultivation of fruits and vegetables provided a rich bounty, enough for all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese were my simple teachings, and I talked to everyone who would listen about the glory of life when Love is put above all else.  Of course, this came in direct conflict with the Roman conquerors whose civilization, for all its cultural advantages, was firmly founded in war and conquest.  Thus, my message of love, while it raised hope and comforted many, put me at odds with the authorities across the region.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friends and students in turn taught the message of God's Love wherever they went. Occasionally, they took notes, and Mary Magdalene recorded some of our teachings in a more formal way in her graceful, clear language.  Those writings have been mostly hidden, revised, or re-translated to present an entirely different perspective - one which engenders fear, want, and feelings of entitlement.  Mother Earth was described as a force to be conquered, and God's Love was shaded with contempt and arrogance.  Our simple and direct Aramaic was twisted into dense and contorted parables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did enjoy using parables to make a point, but where I was quoted, my explanations for the examples I gave would be left out, and the result became murky and contradictory. \n\nThis is my reason for giving these messages to the world at this time:  to help those who felt the truth of my message find their way back to the simple pleasures of knowing who you are, where you came from, and what life is really about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the Universe, life thrives.  We are not alone, nor are we the most advanced civilization.  Far from it.  Our Brothers and Sisters from the Stars are here in the skies above you, waiting patiently to be of help in the most important endeavor a being can take part in - the Ascension of the entire population of the planet.  With this lifting of all souls to higher dimensions, we will also experience a lifting of energies throughout the Multiverse, for it is a Universal process.  It is the destiny, the inner drive of all lifeforms, this evolution to higher dimensions, and you are a part of that process, every one of you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I must return to the story I promised you - the story of my life.  Mary and I continued to live and teach, we had two children, a boy and a girl, and lived a life as nearly idyllic as a family could experience for a time.  It was a simpler time, and we were generously supported emotionally and financially by our families and our community so that we could travel, do our healing work, and continue to spread our message throughout what is now known as the Middle East and beyond.  Our beloved friends welcomed us warmly, cared for us and our children with great love, and made it possible for us to share our message widely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was completely devoted to my beloved Mary, my love, my inspiration and the center of my life, as I am still.  We have remained as twin souls even as we have continued our long relationship with Planet Earth and her beloved humankind.  She has incarnated since, and is in a body now, as are most of your Ascended Masters - especially the female counterparts who are here to usher in the Age of the Feminine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou are all familiar with the supposed end of my life, when the forces of Darkness within both the Jewish community and the Roman governance aligned to persecute me as a traitor and a troublemaker.  They did put out the warrant for my arrest, I was alerted, and it was apparent that the inevitable would come to pass.  I was to be made an example of in order to quell the growing foment against the oppressive Roman rule.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called my beloved family together - I did not call them disciples; they were my close friends and fellow travelers, my trusted companions.  None was more loyal or devoted than my dearest Brother, Judas as you call him.  I called him to my side to talk with him about the impending confrontation with the Roman soldiers.  I asked him to go to them, to tell them of my whereabouts in order to avoid a search-and-seizure melee which would have put my entire family in danger.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe carried out my wishes faithfully, as I knew he would, for he was the incarnated Soul of Light, Lucifer, son of my beloved Brother whom you now call St. Germain.  He was and is the Bearer of the Light of God, as his name represents.  He did not then nor has he ever had any connection to the fantasy creation the Dark Ones called Satan.  There was no bribe or betrayal - he loved me then as he does now, without reservation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so it happened that I was taken into custody, given a brief and pre-judged trial at the hand of the autocratic Pontius Pilate and taken to be tied up and yes, nailed with spikes, not to a cross but to a large tree in the commons, in full view of the populace.  I was not given the honor of being put on a cross, contrary to the later contrived history.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe whole procession and \"execution\" carried little of the drama or pageantry of the Hollywood version.  It was a stark demonstration of cruelty and raw abuse of power.  I was tied to the tree, nails in my feet and hands, causing great pain and anguish to both the tree and me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was able then to leave my body, call upon my Creator to protect and sustain me, and we put the body into a deep coma state, which you might call suspended animation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe, the souls who had inhabited this body until then, were able to ascend into higher dimensions while we tended to the body's care.  We kept the thread of life alive until the body was taken away, and with the care of our beloved mother and wife, the body was later resuscitated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, I did later meet my friends on the road, and I appeared to Paul, too, after I had spent a short time recuperating from the wounds, with the exquisite ministrations of my two miraculous Marys.  I did not leave the planet then. No, I lived on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe traveled to France, where we were welcomed and protected, and where we were able to provide the education and safety our children required.  It was there that our third child was born, and Mary Magdalene established her own mystery school.  We later traveled to Turkey and the Far East, where we were also welcomed.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt the strong connection to Buddhism, and wished to unify the teachings to include many of the tenets of Buddhism - especially the emphasis on creating peace by making peace within, the concentration on the inner search, and the use of meditation to reach a higher vibration and connection to God.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was in Tibet that I found the mystical and mythical places where Heaven and Earth meet.  There are portals there to Inner Earth, and the monks have studied the deep healing techniques and quiet practices which allow them to live for hundreds of years.  I remained with them for extended periods during my eighth decade of life, in perfect health.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a long and fulfilling life, filled with rich companionship and especially in my older years, with quiet contemplation in the embrace of God's Love.  I returned from my travels to be with my Beloved Mary in our last years.  We remained in France, with occasional sojourns to England and Scotland, until my natural death at the age of about 86, and Mary followed me very shortly afterward.  We felt at the time that we had begun an awakening, but we were aware of the campaign of Paul, who called himself an Apostle, and took it upon himself to create a new sect, Christianity.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had not intended to create a religion.  I only wanted to bring the message of Love and Light, which would have illuminated the world's existing religious teachings.  Ours was a straight-forward message - which, if left to flourish and spread, would have created peace on Planet Earth, or at least would have established a bulwark against the flood of Dark Energies which came with the increasing invasion of the genetically modified Reptilians.  However, as so often happens, it turned out to be those who professed to be supporters who created the most lasting distortion of our teachings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Constantine ordered the compilation and publication of the Bible of all my available teachings, the result was anything but accurate or complete.  His intentions were politically motivated.  He wished to control the burgeoning growth of what was then being called Christianity - the recognition of the Christ Consciousness on Planet Earth.  The Emperor saw the threat of allowing Light to filter throughout his far-flung and increasingly unmanageable Empire.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJoy and Peace insulates the people from propaganda and fear-mongering, and the belief in a glorious afterlife in the presence of God tends to make them fearless in their resistance to being controlled.  Allegiance to family, community and to God dilutes one's loyalty to any political entity, dissolving artificial boundaries and national fervor.  The priesthood which was a powerful entity in its own right aligned with Constantine's needs because it was in their own benefit to maintain the power of the Patriarchy-as-religion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so, the document you call the Bible was created.  The Old Testament set the tone, with its emphasis on wars, competition and vengeance.  The picture of God it painted combined the teachings of the most narrow and violent sects of early Judaism, which were designed to align with the later writings, most of which were doctored, redacted, reinterpreted and redesigned to create the confusing, contradictory messages you now find in it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe concept of sin was introduced into the writings, and the picture of a Satanic anti-hero, lifted from the fearsome folklore which had been used by parents to subdue their children, became a primary tool of control.  Guilt and shame centered around the control of sexual practices and obedience to an external, punishing God.  This \"God\" was indeed a reflection of the perfectly controlling Emperor, but it bore no resemblance to the God who was my Father of Creation, my own loving Creator.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will say definitively, a child cannot be born in sin, since an infant is a completely innocent Light, untouched by Darkness, a pure soul in the process of beginning a new life.   Creating a child is a holy act, blessed by all in Heaven.  Nothing an infant could do could be in any way associated with sin or evil.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is one remaining travesty which must be addressed here, and which must be healed before Mother Earth's people will be able to live in peace.  That is the idea that Christianity is the one true religion.  I do not, and never have, taught that I was the final expert, or the only son of God.  We are all children of God. No single person or set of teachings is The Last Word - superior to all others. There is only one Prime Creator, the Creator of all Creation.  No individual or religion has a direct line or a preferred standing with Him, yet all are equal in his eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, you see, the idea of a religious war is an absurdity.  Every soul on Earth and throughout the Multiverse has an equal place in His heart, and a open line to communicate, without the need of intermediaries, priests, or even channelers. You are each born with the ability and the desire to be connected to the Love, protection and forgiveness of our Creator.  To do so will bring only joy and deep fulfillment to all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will not offer you detailed descriptions of the people and places I encountered in my life.  Those elements are not important, except to confirm my love for humankind, and my close attachment to my family, wife and children.  I am not the subject of the teachings God wished to bring to Earth.  I was the vessel for His/Her message of Love. The events of my life are important only as they illuminate what I stood for and what they teach others.  My message was changed when the crucifixion was invented as the centerpiece and largest focal point of my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe image of my body hanging on the cross is indeed a constant reminder to all that you too will be punished for believing in me and my teachings.  It is a gruesome threat, and it wipes out joy.  This indelible image alone has done more damage than all the words could possibly do to discourage exuberance, celebration and Faith.  It elicits sadness and dread, depression and hopelessness.  What comfort can one really take in the statement, \"Christ died for your sins?\"  I must tell you now: I emphatically did not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy punishment at the hands of my persecutors did not defeat me, nor did I die. Neither my life nor my death had anything to do with sin - yours or mine.  I came to Planet Earth to represent the embodiment of a good and loving family, which obviously had nothing to do with celibacy, to teach through living among others, and to lift the hearts of those who had been downtrodden and subjected to unfair political and financial practices.  The abuse of power was as rampant then as it is now, although the means of robbing the poor to give to the rich has become more effective and efficient in recent times.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany people seem horrified to read the channelings from me and also from Mother/Father God which include extensive political content.  I wonder why they would think that my teachings could be separated from the conditions under which people lived, and the oppression which caused massive suffering and deprivation.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople who are suffering oppression have little energy left after struggling to survive, and are more vulnerable to further oppression.  They also have a harder time keeping their hearts filled with Love and their minds open to God's message.  It was my intention to lift the conditions under which people were living as well as the state of their spiritual lives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was also a healer, as I am still.  Physical suffering caused by illness and disability has long been aggravated by poor diet, overcrowding and toxic environmental conditions.  I wished to alleviate the unnecessary pain of physical illness because it tends to leave people exhausted and desperate.  They do turn to God for solace and healing, and once they do, I want to bring them the relief and joy that comes with healing.  This is the reason I am working with so many Lightworkers who are healers now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is time for all of Mother Earth's beings to heal, and for Mother Earth to restore herself after the millennia of abuse at the hands of humankind.  It is time for the Grand Awakening to the Truth that all are One.  There is no individual, no animal, no tree which is not inherently connected through the fiber of their being to every other being.  A tree feels pain when it is cut; it deserves to be honored and respected when it is used to build a house.  Better yet, the technology to completely avoid the use of forest products is available and will soon be brought to Earth by your Galactic Brothers and Sisters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat sort of thinking is required to cause an entire civilization to deplete and devastate its home, the source of all they need for survival?  I believe it is the same Darkness which feeds self-hatred and hatred of others not like oneself. That festering hatred has flowed throughout the relationships between humankind and their companions on Earth, creating a poisonous atmosphere in which animals turned on each other and began to fight and eat each other.  As the vibration of Love courses across the planet, lifting hearts and minds, the animals will respond by feeling and behaving as brothers to one another. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, all the Kingdoms of Earth will join humankind in harmony and Love, and eating one another will be a thing of the past.  Human bodies are evolving to be nourished by a vegetable and fruit diet, and the animals will change along with you.  It has already begun, for both humans and animals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe same pervasive effect applies to your weather, for the consciousness of humankind stirs the same violence in the weather patterns as it does in the animal Kingdom.  Mother Earth is now accomplishing her cleansing and restoration to the pure Eden of her beginnings.  Humankind will either be disrupted and overwhelmed by the violence of her reactions, or you will raise your vibration higher by the day, thereby mitigating the effects of her self-protective actions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tell you these things about the current developments on Earth because, you see, my work with humanity never ended.  I passed from the experience of life in a body in the 3rd dimension directly to the 5th dimension.  Understand, I did ascend, taking my body with me, just as you will do.  This part of the Biblical story is partially true.  It was called a resurrection, which is not as accurate a description as ascension.  I not only came back to life, but I raised my body with me into higher dimensions.  Those of us who have accomplished this will now have a body available to us when we wish to return to Earth, without having to go through the birth and childhood process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI offer you this brief outline of my life to reveal to you the most destructive of the ideas which were presented as if they were mine, as if they represented the Truths as they apply to our Creator and his relationship to us.  There is much more I could tell, but I wished only to point to the most egregious falsehoods - those which created the biggest distortions to the Truth of our relationship to Prime Creator and the Company of Heaven, all of whom are here to assist you now in your coming Ascension.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suggest that you read this autobiographical message in the context of the earlier channeled messages from Mother/Father God, the Creators of the Milky Way Galaxy, who have given you a much more extensive and detailed description.  It was channeled earlier by our dear Kathryn, and it is called \"When God Pinched My Toe.\" They provide the opportunity to feel how we work together with other Ascended Masters to accomplish this glorious and historic Ascension process.  You will hear the Love in their voices and the Truth of their words, which are completely in alignment with my own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe you will come to feel the great Love we have for you, and the Love I have carried in my heart for all these eons.  When others had given up on the humans of Planet Earth, my Faith and my Love remained strong, and I have now been proven right in my faith that together, we will realize the Dream, and accomplish the greatest challenge ever undertaken in the history of the Universe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI Love you all.  We are One, inseparable as the wind and the leaf, forever and always.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am your Jesus/Sananda, together with all the Company of Heaven.  \n\n\nChanneled by Kathryn E.

How often do you watch your thoughts? Your triggers? Your tiredness? Your exhaustion?\n\nI initially heard of the concept of \"being the watcher\" from the Power of Now. The idea that a human being has two entities within them. Their mind and their spirit. We live in a material world. A world of the flesh. Where your mind roams and thrive. Enlightenment comes from separation from your mind. Being in touch with your spirit and watching your mind. Watching what goes on within you. For a long time I understood the logic and in moments felt it. Until today I truly believe I get it. The biggest sign for me was the reactionary state. When I'm in my mind. I react to everything. My mind must deal with everything or anything immediately. Whether someone has done me wrong or work must be done. Overworking the mind then leads to stress. Causing further exhaustion and reliance on quick fixes to relieve the stresses. Creating an unfaithful cycle of stress and self-medication. \n\nSo today and not even necessarily today but I've been aware. Run through this morning. I woke up and I did a ten-minute meditation (lay on my bed eyes close to find a motivational video and just breathe in and out through my nose taking in the words being spoken). After that, I drank water. Made my lunch. Jumped in the shower and went to work. Immediately I felt at ease. I was conscious of the pace I was walking in. I went into default mode and was fast walking (city life) and then as soon as I realised I slowed down and matched my metronome(the pace of my breathing/soul/body. Normally I get exhausted by the time I get to work cus I'm pacing it like I have a man chasing me. Today I strolled. I enjoyed the journey. Got to work. Relaxed. Now I have a friend going through a tough time. Love them but they don't listen. Normally I get really worked up by them not listening. However today I explained my approach and what I believe they should do. They replied with a blunt \"meh\". And I just left it. In the past, I would have got worked up and blasted them for not listening etc. But the stoic/spiritual watcher in me realised I can only control what I can control. I've done my best. Moved on. Another friend started an argument over something so minor. Again just left it. Like just being able to rise above it. I felt my body getting tense. Dropped the phone. Breathed for a few minutes. Found my metronome again and just left it. I realise now in this state. I DONT ENTERTAIN THAT ENERGY. I DONT WANT IT. I DONT LIKE IT. \n\nWriting this at my desk just as something to share. Probably will become an entry in my journal tonight. The aim when I write stuff like this simply for someone to perhaps relate to it or read it and feel they can try this too. I ain't perfect. Far from it. Nothing special. However, I am grateful. I am happy to be alive. Focused on my goals. Focused on my progression. People who cultivate those things progressing as normal can be around me. However, any deterrents can stay far away. I've done the people-pleasing unnecessary loyalty stage on my life. I'm past that.

It began with the earliest teachings of Paul, the self-proclaimed Apostle, who took it upon himself to reinterpret the teachings of Jesus, against wishes of Jerusalem Council, the group of true disciples who had studied with Jesus and who knew him and his original teachings first hand. Unlike them, Paul had never met Jesus, and had newly been \"converted\" from his crusade to persecute and kill Christians. For a detailed and careful referenced discussion of the few Biblical references which refer to the relationships between Paul and the disciples, I refer you to the websites of Scott Nelson and Sharry Shriner concerning Paul's as liar and false prophet, as well as Edgar Jones' book, Paul, the Stranger these researchers and many more have questioned Paul's legitimacy as a representative of Jesus' teachings, as well as honesty. Here, I will summarize the teachings of Paul and their profound influence on the development of religious thought, and the destructive effects we see today in practice of what has come to be called \"Christianity\". The trouble began only three years after Jesus' death, when Paul, by his own report, saw a vision of Jesus on the road to Jerusalem, in which Jesus asked Paul, \"Why do you persecute me?\" Paul was struck to the ground by the power of this experience, and henceforth forswore his persecution of Christ's followers, proclaiming himself an Apostle instead. Nowhere in the Bible does it suggest that Paul was invited to spread the word of Jesus, or that he was in any way trained for the job. In setting himself apart from the original Jewish apostles who followed Christ, Paul created the idea that Christ's teachings were the basis for new religion. Jesus had no intention of setting up a new religion with himself as figurehead. He wanted to expand on Jewish teachings. He attempted to loosen the grip of rule-bound rabical thought which had created a conservative,    authoritarian and dogmatic system emphasizing the role of an angry, vindictive God. Jesus looked through the prism of religion and saw the spectrum of Kindness, Love, Equality and Generosity which had been missing from earlier teachings. He shifted the perspective to a more progressive, open and accepting one, eliminating the need for priests, rabbis and religious \"authorities\" of all kinds. He was liberal, open-minded and inclusive in his life and in his teachings. He excluded no one, regardless of their sexual practices, social status, or religious background. His intention was to elevate Jewish teaching and practice to an individual, Heart-based philosophy of living in which every soul had free and equal access to God's Love. Paul took it upon himself to travel extensively throughout the Middle East to preach to Gentiles about Jesus. His great influence to this day has been in the fact that he wrote extensively, and often boastfully, about his travels and his opinions. He claimed to have been acclaimed Apostle to the Gentiles, although the designation seems to have been of his own creation. As Scott Nelson has aptly pointed out, his writings reveal a unique quality. Along among the writers scriptures, Paul frequently used his own name, and sprinkled thousands of passages with the pronouns I, me and myself. The other writers either remained anonymous and did not discuss themselves of their personal activities. This alone presents a picture of a man of questionable character, since his writings appear to aggrandize himself as the most important and influential Apostle, while none of the other writers except Luke, his side-kick, ever referred to him as an Apostle, and only once in all Luke's writings did this title appear. The problem of having a renegade \"Apostle\" blanketing the countryside with writings and opinions would not have been so serious of it had not been for the insidious distortions Paul created and codified for future generations. \n\n  \nHere are just a few of the most damaging (wrong) ideas which came directly from (self-proclaimed apostle) Paul's teachings and writings, unauthorized by either Jesus or His legitimate disciples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Jesus died for our sins. Because of our evil doings, Jesus died.\n\n2. Jesus' life represents the suffering and persecution of all people on earth.\n\n3. Jesus was God's only Son. The rest of us don't belong to the family.\n\n4. God is in Heaven, sitting on a throne passing judgment on those of us far below. We humans do not have individual relationship with Him. He puts in an appearance every few thousands years.\n\n5. Jesus' resurrection was a result of his special relationship with God. The rest of us can't expect eternal life as a general rule.\n\n6. The trinity is made up of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, a mysterious specter who symbolizes death.\n\n7. Christianity's God is the one real God, because Jesus was His only real Son.\n\n8. Jesus should be worshiped because He is God, not a real man.\n\n9. Because Jesus was a God, his day to day life was not like ours. We can't really be like Him.\n\n10. Jesus bestowed miracles on people. They were healed by magic, not because they grew into health because He inspired them to.\n\n11. Jesus asked his followers to abandon their family farms and go with Him, leaving their families to starve.\n\n12. Jesus kicked the money chargers out of the temple because they were cheating people, not because He objected to commercial business being carried on in the temple.\n\n13. Christianity is a new religion, separate and apart from Judaism.\n\n14. Christians do not have to follow the Laws, including dietary and health laws and traditions which had been the foundation of an ethical and practical way of life, based on the teachings of Moses and earlier prophets.\n\n15. Moses' Ten Commandments are no longer relevant. They can be reduced to one: Help the poor.\n\n16. Jesus' teachings can be reduced to one: Help the poor.\n\n17. Dietary laws are not important. Pork and other unclean animals and fish are okay if you like them.\n\n18. Wine represents the blood of Christ, therefore it is okay to drink a lot of it.\n\n19. Man has dominion over everything else on earth. We own the Earth. Everything on it is there for our use and convenience.\n\n20. Man is born with Original Sin, the essence of evil in his being. He can only be saved by adhering strictly to the teachings of Paul.\n\n21. The purpose of religion is to frighten people into avoiding evil. The Devil is always among us, attempting to lead people away from God.\n\n22. Anyone not baptized in the Christian faith cannot go to Heaven, or be granted eternal life.\n\n23. God is an angry disciplinarian who sits in judgment over all human activity, meting our punishments, especially to those who do not obey Him. Sinners will go to Hell.\n\n24. Adam and Eve were kicked out of the Garden because they had sex, not because they had begun to rely on their heads rather than their hearts.\n\n25. Sex is dirty. It should be avoided except for the purpose of reproduction.\n\n26. Homosexuality is a crime against God. So is masturbation.\n\n27. Jesus was not married; he was celibate. Priests and other teachers of God's word should be celibate, because sex is dirty.\n\n28. Priests must be relied upon to interpret God's word, since people cannot find faith on their own.\n\n29. Women are inferior to men and should be excluded from decision-making of every kind because their judgment cannot be trusted.\n\n30. Mary Magdalene was not Jesus' wife or one of his closest disciples. She was a prostitute.\n\n31. Mary Magdalene washed Jesus' feet because she was beneath Him.\n\n32. Loose hair means a loose woman. Women should covet their heads to avoid seducing men.\n\n33. Children belong to their parents, and are indebted to their parents for giving them life.\n\n34. God rewards Christians with material wealth and other worldy success. Anyone not following these (Paul's) doctrines will be punished with poverty and disease as a result.\n\n35. The proper place of worship is in a church, preferably a very grand one.\n\n36. Christian doctrine should take precedence over civil law. Governments should bow to Church leaders. \n\n37. Churches should be allowed to own property and should not be subject to taxes. It is appropriate for a church to be a center of wealth and power.\n\n38. An Apostle is anyone who feels the urge to teach in Jesus'  name.

It is an exciting time, isn't it? But even with all the positive changes, you probably know some folks who are getting crankier and crankier because our loving energy challenges the emotional settings and philosophy of life they are used to. You can see it is a case of being shaken from their underpinnings, and for people who tend to be a little rigid or controlling, this can be an enormous challenge. They will struggle to hang on to their old ways until something reaches a breaking point - either they will stop fighting it and ease into the new higher vibration, or they will begin to lash out, blaming others for their discomfort. In this case it may be their relationships which will break. Either way, they will find the horizons expanding, and everyone will be offered the opportunity to open their sites to new and different ways to live.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow are you handling the shifts? Do you find yourself exhausted one day, so energized you can hardly sleep the next? Do you find yourself falling in love with your friends and neighbors in a way you have never felt before? Do you see the sparkling God presence in the children around you as never before? Have you experienced animals coming up to you to get acquainted, even the wild ones? Do you greet them warmly and without fear? If you do, you will be affirming your connection with all living creatures, and Mother Nature will smile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you open your heart, all the world feels your warmth and will beam up to meet you. Do not minimize the importance of this attraction. It is the growing evidence of Our loving presence, which you are feeling as Light beaming down on and through you as your I AM Presence. Feel it: the stream of Love flows down through your crown chakra, through the center of your brain, the third eye center, your throat chakra and down into your heart center. Anchor it there so that you feel the powerful connection between the center of your brain and the center of your heart. Then let it flow on downward through your lower chakras and into the Earth. Mother Earth will feel your loving energy and will respond in kind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce you anchor the energy of the I Am Presence in your mind and heart, your life will unfold in a very different way. The small annoyances that used to ruin your day will become trivial, hardly worth noticing. The people who used to drive you crazy will seem a bit amusing in their extreme attitudes. You may find you no longer are attracted to the material belongings you used to covet; in fact, you may find you are so occupied with creative work and social interactions that you hardly give those things a second thought anymore. You may even feel small ripples of repulsion when you hear people bragging about their new cars or expensive toys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo not be alarmed if you have cravings to leave everything you have spent years building - your business, your career, your bank account, all the things you thought of as success - to give it all away and begin over in a simpler way. It is a normal response to the Love Bug. You might say you have been bitten by the energy of Love, and it will make you itch for the deeply satisfying real experiences you have put on hold for \"later,\" after you have completed all the things you planned for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat if nothing you planned for comes to completion? What if you walk out your door one morning and discover that the whole world smiles on you, and there is no more reason to compete with yourself or anyone else because you are perfect just the way you are, and you have everything you need? This is the New Golden Age you are feeling being born this very year. It will bring far more than an end to poverty and want. It will not create unlimited appetite for material possessions, because that was the false satisfaction for not enough Love. When Love enters your heart - not from the gift of love from another but from within yourself - nothing can be more fulfilling or complete.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat will people do if they have no immediate needs? Of course, they will create a new life for themselves based on the beliefs and feelings that remain lodged in their systems from The Old Days, if they have not prepared themselves for the real changes around them. This is where all of you come in. You are the initiates, the leaders who will show the way when everyone else is trying to replace the old structures with more old structures just like the ones that have disintegrated. Your talents and your training will be invaluable. Even the education you thought was irrelevant will serve you well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEach of you has a special gift; you are often too blinded by the criticism you grew up with to even notice it. You have, without your realizing it, gathered information and skills which will increase the value of those gifts. The difference will be that the skills which would have brought in more money are going to be far less valuable than the ones which were overlooked in the old system. For instance, good teachers will be of great value, and we do not mean those who know how to wield a piece of chalk. Remember the Golden Age of Greece - would you not prefer to be taught by Socrates, strolling with you through the town square, presenting you with brain puzzles and challenging moral questions than to be lectured at in a class of two hundred fidgeting, bored college sophomores?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook deeply into yourself. Notice how many of the things you have become accustomed to doing are actually escapist; they helped you to avoid the feelings left over from a day or a year of doing something you dislike. Watching television, for instance, is not truly relaxing; it is hypnotic. It may be better than pacing the floor, but it does not nourish your soul. The same goes for many of the entertainments which fit into the category of what you call \"hanging out.\" If it requires or even includes a mind-altering substance, it is a symptom of dis-ease, dissatisfaction with life, but you probably feel defensive about keeping it. Of course you do. It helped to while away the miserable hours. No such activities will be required when you have nothing to make you feel stifled and misused.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat did you love to do as a child? Don't discount playing in the creek, or coloring crayon pictures in your room, or being enraptured by the bean plant you were allowed to raise yourself. Every activity that is self-initiated indicates inner-directed motivation, a wonderful trait of all humankind which has been demoted to hobby status by the current culture. It is this inner drive which will have the chance to flourish in the new era.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are giving you these images and ideas of what to think about and what to expect so that you are not overwhelmed or completely disoriented by the changes. Learn to flow with it in your imagination, and you will be able to do so in reality. We have been preparing together for this wonderful change for years now, little by little. Think back on the past 5 years, and you will realize how you have evolved. No single shift may be obvious as you are living it, but the cumulative learning experiences have had a life-changing impact, have they not? Ten years ago would you have been attracted to channeled messages from Mother/Father God in the eager way you are now? How many of you have said to us: \"Thank you! I just can't get enough!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe delight in your thirst for Truth. Many of you have left dogmatic religions but felt a bit rudderless, without a replacement which could satisfy your soul longing for a real connection to Us. You were taught you needed an intermediary, someone to interpret the Word of God for you. We are here to tell you that is not true. Each of you has within you the ability to feel our presence, to listen to your intuition and follow it, and even to hear our voices speaking to you as our dear channel does.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are teaching you what you need to become connected to Us as a constant state of Love and Light. It is the exercise we gave you at the beginning of this message. This is the vertical ray of Light which runs through your whole system. Add to that the centering exercises which teach you to reach the center of your brain (in your Light channel) as your standard operating procedure, and you will be well prepared for a life of Love and service.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou see, Love, Light and Service go together. It is what we do, and it is what you will be discovering in yourself when you do the exercises every day. Join us in Love, Dear Children. There simply is no replacement or any substitute, as you will discover as you build your new society to benefit everyone, in every conceivable way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe will be here to congratulate you every step of the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are Mother/Father God, with the Legions of Light, who love you beyond measure.  \n\n\nChanneled by Kathryn E.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The three modes of material nature, namely goodness, passion and ignorance, pertain to material intelligence and not to the spirit soul. By development of material goodness one can conquer the modes of passion and ignorance, and by cultivation of transcendental goodness one may free oneself even from material goodness.\n\n2. When the living entity becomes strongly situated in the mode of goodness, then religious principles, characterized by devotional service to Me, become prominent. One can strengthen the mode of goodness by cultivation of those things that are already situated in goodness, and thus religious principles arise.\n\n3. Religious principles, strengthened by the mode of goodness, destroy the influence of passion and ignorance. When passion and ignorance are overcome, their original cause, irreligion, is quickly vanquished.\n\n4. According to the quality of religious scriptures, water, one\u2019s association with one\u2019s children or with people in general, the particular place, the time, activities, birth, meditation, chanting of mantras, and purificatory rituals, the modes of nature become differently prominent.\n\n5. Among the ten items I have just mentioned, the great sages who understand Vedic knowledge have praised and recommended those that are in the mode of goodness, criticized and rejected those in the mode of ignorance, and shown indifference to those in the mode of passion.\n\n6. Until one revives one\u2019s direct knowledge of the spirit soul and drives away the illusory identification with the material body and mind caused by the three modes of nature, one must cultivate those things in the mode of goodness. By increasing the mode of goodness, one automatically can understand and practice religious principles, and by such practice transcendental knowledge is awakened.\n\n7. In a bamboo forest the wind sometimes rubs the bamboo stalks together, and such friction generates a blazing fire that consumes the very source of its birth, the bamboo forest. Thus, the fire is automatically calmed by its own action. Similarly, by the competition and interaction of the material modes of nature, the subtle and gross material bodies are generated. If one uses his mind and body to cultivate knowledge, then such enlightenment destroys the influence of the modes of nature that generated one\u2019s body. Thus, like the fire, the body and mind are pacified by their own actions in destroying the source of their birth.\n\n8. Sri Uddhava said: My dear Krishna, generally human beings know that material life brings great future unhappiness, and still they try to enjoy material life. My dear Lord, how can one in knowledge act just like a dog, an ass or a goat?\n\n9-10. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Uddhava, a person bereft of intelligence first falsely identifies himself with the material body and mind, and when such false knowledge arises within one\u2019s consciousness, material passion, the cause of great suffering, pervades the mind, which by nature is situated in goodness. Then the mind, contaminated by passion, becomes absorbed in making and changing many plans for material advancement. Thus, by constantly thinking of the modes of material nature, a foolish person is afflicted with unbearable material desires.\n\n11. One who does not control the material senses comes under the control of material desires and is thus bewildered by the strong waves of the mode of passion. Such a person executes material activities, although clearly seeing that the result will be future unhappiness.\n\n12. Although the intelligence of a learned person may be bewildered by the modes of passion and ignorance, he should again carefully bring the mind under control. By clearly seeing the contamination of the modes of nature, he does not become attached.\n\n13. A person should be attentive and grave and never lazy or morose. Mastering the yoga procedures of breathing and sitting properly, one should practice fixing the mind on Me at dawn, noon and sunset, and thus gradually the mind should be completely absorbed in Me.\n\n14. The actual yoga system as taught by My devotees, headed by Sanaka-kumara, is simply this: Having withdrawn the mind from all other objects, one should directly and appropriately absorb it in Me.\n\n15. Sri Uddhava said: My dear Keshava, at what time and in what form did You instruct the science of yoga to Sanaka and his brothers? I now desire to know about these things.\n\n16. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Once, the mental sons of Lord Brahma, namely, the sages headed by Sanaka, inquired from their father about the difficult subject matter of the supreme goal of yoga.\n\n17. The sages headed by Sanaka said: O Lord, people\u2019s minds are naturally attracted to material sense objects, and similarly the sense objects in the form of desire enter within the mind. Therefore, how can a person who desires liberation, who desires to cross over activities of sense gratification, destroy this mutual relationship between the sense objects and the mind? Please explain this to us.\n\n18. The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Uddhava, Brahma himself, who is born directly from the body of the Lord and who is the creator of all living entities within the material world, being the best of the demigods, seriously contemplated the question of his sons headed by Sanaka. The intelligence of Brahma, however, was affected by his own activities of creation, and thus he could not discover the essential answer to this question.\n\n19. Lord Brahma desired to attain the answer to the question that was puzzling him, and thus he fixed his mind on Me, the Supreme Lord. At that time, in My form of Hamsa, I became visible to Lord Brahma.\n\n20. Thus seeing Me, the sages, placing Brahma in the lead, came forward and worshiped My lotus feet. Then they frankly asked Me, \u201cWho are You?\u201d\n\n21. My dear Uddhava, the sages, being eager to understand the ultimate truth of the yoga system, thus inquired from Me. Now please hear as I explain that which I spoke unto the sages.\n\n22. My dear brahmanas, if, when asking Me who I am, you believe that I am also a jiva soul and that there is no ultimate difference between us\u2014since all souls are ultimately one without individuality\u2014then how is your question possible or appropriate? Ultimately, what is the real situation or resting place both of yourselves and of Me?\n\n23. If by asking Me \u201cWho are You?\u201d you were referring to the material body, then I must point out that all material bodies are constituted of five elements, namely earth, water, fire, air and ether. Thus, you should have asked, \u201cWho are you five?\u201d If you consider that all material bodies are ultimately one, being constituted essentially of the same elements, then your question is still meaningless, since there would be no deep purpose in distinguishing one body from another. Thus, it appears that in asking My identity, you are merely speaking words, without any real meaning or purpose.\n\n24. Within this world, whatever is perceived by the mind, speech, eyes or other senses is Me alone and nothing besides Me. All of you please understand this by a straightforward analysis of the facts.\n\n25. My dear sons, the mind has a natural proclivity to enter into the material sense objects, and similarly the sense objects enter into the mind; but both this material mind and the sense objects are merely designations that cover the spirit soul, who is part and parcel of Me.\n\n26. A person who has thus achieved Me by understanding that he is not different from Me realizes that the material mind is lodged within the sense objects because of constant sense gratification, and that the material objects are existing prominently within the material mind. Having understood My transcendental nature, he gives up both the material mind and its objects.\n\n27. Waking, sleeping and deep sleep are the three functions of the intelligence and are caused by the modes of material nature. The living entity within the body is ascertained to possess characteristics different from these three states and thus remains us a witness to them.\n\n28. The spirit soul is trapped in the bondage of material intelligence, which awards him constant engagement in the illusory modes of nature. But I am the fourth stage of consciousness, beyond wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep. Becoming situated in Me, the soul should give up the bondage of material consciousness. At that time, the living entity will automatically renounce the material sense objects and the material mind.\n\n29. The false ego of the living entity places him in bondage and awards him exactly the opposite of what he really desires. Therefore, an intelligent person should give up his constant anxiety to enjoy material life and remain situated in the Lord, who is beyond the functions of material consciousness.\n\n30. According to My instructions, one should fix the mind on Me alone. If, however, one continues to see many different values and goals in life rather than seeing everything within Me, then although apparently awake, one is actually dreaming due to incomplete knowledge, just as one may dream that one has wakened from a dream.\n\n31. Those states of existence that are conceived of as separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no actual existence, although they create a sense of separation from the Absolute Truth. Just as the seer of a dream imagines many different activities and rewards, similarly, because of the sense of an existence separate from the Lord\u2019s existence, the living entity falsely performs fruitive activities, thinking them to be the cause of future rewards and destinations.\n\n32. While awake the living entity enjoys with all of his senses the fleeting characteristics of the material body and mind; while dreaming he enjoys similar experiences within the mind; and in deep dreamless sleep all such experiences merge into ignorance. By remembering and contemplating the succession of\n\nwakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep, the living entity can understand that he is one throughout the three stages of consciousness and is transcendental. Thus, he becomes the lord of the senses.\n\n33. You should consider how, by the influence of My illusory energy, these three states of the mind, caused by the modes of nature, have been artificially imagined to exist in Me. Having definitely ascertained the truth of the soul, you should utilize the sharpened sword of knowledge, acquired by logical reflection and from the instructions of sages and Vedic literatures, to completely cut off the false ego, which is the breeding ground of all doubts. All of you should then worship Me, who am situated within the heart.\n\n34. One should see that the material world is a distinct illusion appearing in the mind, because material objects have an extremely flickering existence and are here today and gone tomorrow. They can be compared to the streaking red line created by whirling a fiery stick. The spirit soul by nature exists in the single state of pure consciousness. However, in this world he appears in many different forms and stages of existence. The modes of nature divide the soul\u2019s consciousness into normal wakefulness, dreaming and dreamless sleep. All such varieties of perception, however, are actually maya and exist only like a dream.\n\n35. Having understood the temporary illusory nature of material things, and thus having pulled one\u2019s vision away from illusion, one should remain without material desires. By experiencing the happiness of the soul, one should give up material speaking and activities. If sometimes one must observe the material world, one should remember that it is not ultimate reality and therefore one has given it up. By such constant remembrance up till the time of death, one will not again fall into illusion.\n\n36. Just as a drunken man does not notice if he is wearing his coat or shirt, similarly, one who is perfect in self-realization and who has thus achieved his eternal identity does not notice whether the temporary body is sitting or standing. Indeed, if by God\u2019s will the body is finished or if by God\u2019s will he obtains a new body, a self-realized soul does not notice, just as a drunken man does not notice the situation of his outward dress.\n\n37. The material body certainly moves under the control of supreme destiny and therefore must continue to live along with the senses and vital air as long as one\u2019s karma is in effect. A self-realized soul, however, who is awakened to the absolute reality and who is thus highly situated in the perfect stage of yoga, will never again surrender to the material body and its manifold manifestations, knowing it to be just like a body visualized in a dream.\n\n38. My dear brahmanas, I have now explained to you the confidential knowledge of Sankhya, by which one philosophically distinguishes matter from spirit, and of astanga-yoga, by which one links up with the Supreme. Please understand that I am the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vishnu, and that I have appeared before you desiring to explain your actual religious duties.\n\n39. O best of the brahmanas, please know that I am the supreme shelter of the yoga system, analytic philosophy, virtuous action, truthful religious principles, power, beauty, fame and self-control.\n\n40. All superior transcendental qualities, such as being beyond the modes of nature, detached, the well-wisher, the most dear, the Supersoul, equally situated everywhere, and free from material entanglement\u2014all such qualities, free from the transformations of material qualities, find their shelter and worshipable object in Me.\n\n41. \\[Lord Krishna continued:\\] My dear Uddhava, thus all of the doubts of the sages headed by Sanaka were destroyed by My words. Fully worshiping Me with transcendental love and devotion, they chanted My glories with excellent hymns.\n\n42. The greatest of sages, headed by Sanaka Rsi, thus perfectly worshiped and glorified Me, and as Lord Brahma looked on, I returned to My own abode.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 55338, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Hamsa-Avatara Answers the Questions of the Sons of Brahma (Uddhava Gita)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567684650, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/czjuop/the_hamsaavatara_answers_the_questions_of_the/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "idontwannabestuck", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2tdrrcz9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567598111, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/czjtpk/kundalini_yoga_any_insights/", "gildings": {}, "id": "czjtpk", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/czjtpk/kundalini_yoga_any_insights/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567598112, "score": 1, "selftext": "I really want to try the kundalini yoga, any insights??", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 55337, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Kundalini yoga any insights?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567684488, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/czjtpk/kundalini_yoga_any_insights/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Thedivineplan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4gmhc1bw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567597725, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/czjrao/quick_message_of_surrender_twin_flamesdivine_love/", "gildings": {}, "id": "czjrao", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/czjrao/quick_message_of_surrender_twin_flamesdivine_love/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567597725, "score": 1, "selftext": "September 4 2019~ I was guided to use The Power of Surrender Cards by Judith Orloff .

I will skip the story prior to it, since it is very long story, how I got it it, I can just quote one verse from the bible.  \nAsk, and it shall be given to you.  \nSeek, and you will find.  \nKnock, and the door will be opened to you.  \n\\~Matthew 7:7\n\nOne night, while my body lay in bed, mind immersed in deep sleep, in the empty, void, dark and silent state of being, I heard a voice, which spoke, \" 'I AM' Sananda \" (Jesus' Higher True Soul Name) (And I would like to add that it a telepathic communication He used slang exactly as I use) \" I heard your prayers brother/child \" (brother/child sounded telepathically like one word), Through the power of His next word, my soul was lifted out of the body, as he said \"rise\", same instance my soul obeyed and raised upward our outward from this world which faded from my awareness and perception, and here I was, on a higher platform, or higher dimension if you will, where everything was light, (I was in pure soul state, and there were no senses involved). We can say my body was in something like suspended animation while my soul was liberated from the flesh of the body and material world. And here in the light, figure radiated before me, the figure before me shined brighter than all the light around me. This Light which He had emanated was warming my entire soul to my very core. This was something absolutely best that my soul ever felt, because the beauty of this radiance, and the warmth of this Light, was the most powerful Love which my soul felt. As if I came face to face, with power of ten thousand Sun's.\n\nNow, if I were to write all that had transpired afterwards, I supposed I would need to reincarnate 10.000 times to write it all down,   If I were to write down everything that Jesus revealed to me, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.\n\nWhat ever I wanted to know and learn, see and experience, by the speed of thought we were there seeing it and reliving it, as in real time, but it was a holographic experience. First we talked what would I like to do and be in this life, he helped me realize my purpose, mission, life goals, helped me design best possible life, and imagine life of my dreams, which we did by having Akashic Record Consultation. I dont feel like writing personal things, but I will share with you what Akashic Records are so you may have a better understanding of my experience.  \n\n\nThe Akashic Record, known in the Bible as \u201cThe Book of Life,\u201d is a vibrational record of each soul and every thing in existence, from inception to future probabilities.  In Sanskrit, the word \u201cakasha\u201d means primordial substance, that out of which all things are formed.  The Akashic Record is a foundational, energetic library of Truth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Akashic Records are an energetic imprint of every thought, action, emotion, and experience that has ever occurred in time and space.  The Akashic Records can also be understood as the imprint of all experiences of all lifetime in all realities.  They are an etheric, holographic repository of information for human consciousness for the past, present and potentials for the future.  The energy that makes up the Akashic Records is the energy of Love!  The knowledge contained in the Akashic Records is imprinted upon a subtle substance called the Akasha, which describes the energy of Love that permeates and creates everything in the Universe. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Akasha is available everywhere, all the time.  Everyone can access information from the Akashic Records at any time, and indeed we do!  The flashes of intuition and knowing hunches that occur every day are glimpses into the divine wisdom contained in the Akashic Records.  Every being in the Universe contributes to and accesses the Akashic Records.  Because we are all created by and connected to the energy of Love, our divine birthright includes having access to the divine wisdom and knowledge contained in the Akashic Records.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Akashic Records contain all past, present, and future possibilities through the vibrations of compassion and joy.  They are like the DNA of the universe.  They contain a collection of everything that has occurred in the past, and they hold a complete set of information regarding possibilities for the future.  Every individual soul has its own, unique Akashic Record.  The souls of groups, events, organizations, and locations also have a unique Akashic Record.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne way to understand the Akashic Records is to envision them as a book that contains the entire history of your soul, as well as every aspect of who you are now and all the potentials for your future.  This metaphorical book is so vast that it could never exist physically.  Instead, it is recorded energetically in the vibration of the Love that makes up everything in the Universe. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe clear truth contained in the Akashic Records allows us the freedom to choose grace in all things.  When we know the truth, we can release any illusions we have created that cause us to believe we are separate from God, Spirit, or Source.  The Akashic Records are one of the most powerful tools available on the planet today, to help us remember our Oneness with every being in the Universe, and to find our personal and collective power to create the realities we desire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is the history of the Akashic Records?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe concept of the Akashic Records has been referred to in every spiritual tradition on the planet.  In the Bible, it is referred to as the Book of Life.  The Akashic Records are also referred to as the Cosmic Mind or Universal Mind, as well as the Eye of God and the Word of God.  References to the Akashic Records, or the eternal Book of Life, date back to antiquity. References in the Old Testament and beyond give us the sense that there is a collective storehouse of knowledge that is written on the fabric of reality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe energy that contains the information in the Akashic Records is called Akasha, which is a Sanskrit term meaning \u201cprimary substance.\u201d  This is the energy that makes up everything in the Universe.  It is the energy of love.  In Hindu mysticism Akasha is thought to be the primary principle of nature from which the other four natural principles of fire, air, earth, and water, are created.  Every vibration that occurs in the Universe through our thoughts, words, and deeds creates an indelible imprint on the Akasha, leaving an energetic recording of every soul and every creation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe word, Akasha, is derived from two ancient Tibetan or northern Indian words.  \u201cAka\u201d means space, storage place, or repository, and \u201cSa\u201d means sky, hidden, or secret.  A simple translation of \u201cAkasha\u201d is \u201can unseen space or storage place.\u201d  The Akashic Records are, then, a hidden library of records imprinted on the subtle space of the Akasha.   The Akashic Records are believed to have existed since the beginning of the time-space continuum of planet Earth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWho has access to the Akashic Records?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust as we have various kinds of physical libraries, such as law libraries and medical libraries, there are various ethereal libraries in the Akashic Records.  Every person, animal, group, organization, event, and location on Earth has a unique Akashic Record.  By divine birthright, we have the ability to access our own personal Akashic Records, as well as the Records of any group of which we are a part.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery being on the planet can access the areas of the Akashic Records of which their soul plays a part.  Alternately, no one can access our personal Akashic Records without our express permission.  The Akashic Records are protected by spiritual beings who are referred to as the Guides, the Keepers, or the Guardians of the Akashic Records.  These Spirit Keepers help us access our Akashic Records, and they hold strong energetic protection for the information contained therein.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow can I access the Akashic Records?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople access the Akashic Records often through intuition, prayer, meditation, and flashes of insight.  Many of us experience these glimpses of the Akashic Records on a daily basis.  For many people, intentionally opening ourselves to our intuition and inner guidance provides a powerful opening to the information in the Akashic Records.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe can learn to access the Akashic Records more specifically through learning techniques for opening the Akashic Records.  These techniques can include the use of meditations, breathing techniques, and a sacred, spoken prayer of opening. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition to opening the Records ourselves, we can find great clarity through an Akashic Records consultation.  A Consultation, or Reading, consists of having someone who has experience and expertise in working with the Akashic Records open your Records so that you can receive information from them.  An Akashic Record Consultation can be extremely valuable, because it offers specific information that arises directly from your personal soul journey.  Every conceivable question regarding your life and your soul journey can be answered during an Akashic Records Consultation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat information can I get from the Akashic Records?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Akashic Records contain every thought, emotion, action, and experience that has ever occurred in time and space.  Your personal Akashic Records contain every piece of information regarding your soul\u2019s experience.  In the Records, you can learn about your relationships, your health, your soul path, and every other conceivable topic regarding you!  Because the information in the Akashic Records is held in the energy of love, the answers you receive to questions during an Akashic Reading offer helpfulness and hopefulness as well as profound empowerment through knowing the truth of your situation and the possibilities unfolding in your life.  \n\n\nSo, I was shown some of my more famous lifetimes, then I was shown this life I live, from cradle, to the future. When I saw the future I was amazed beyond belief, I was like \"this will really happen?!\" to which He assured me that it will. After we talked about all possible things my soul desired to ask and know, at the end, He asked me \"You were trying to achieve Nirvana by meditating, do you want to experience it now?\" I was blown away by His grace and generosity! Like 'whaat?! really?!\" But He warned me, that in that selfless state, there is only experience of pure bliss, harmony, love and peace, and when time comes for my soul to come back to my body that I will be overcome by intense suffering of material existence, I consented. Next instant, I was trown into a lake of pure energy, a sea of love, energy of pure harmony, extazy, bliss and complete peace, joy and perfection - I was home! It lasted for eternity and at same time as if for moment, for next instant I was sucked back to body so to speak, I cried out with intense pain \"nooo! please I want to go back!\"  \n\n\nHe comforted me, while I was in body, He told me that I will not remember what I had experience when I wake up, but that I shouldn't worry that in time most important things will come to me, and He told me just to follow and listen to my heart, that all all answers and all knowledge I will need will come to me from my heart, that our heart is connected to our Higher Self.  \n\n\nBefore I woke up, I insisted could He leave me some physical mark on my body (I watched too much freddy krueger movies as kid) He said He doesn't want to hurt me on anything, but I insisted (even asked is it impossible for Him to do such thing, when ever I asked that He proved otherwise - everything was possible for Him to do). Next moment, I felt burn/scratch like pain on my foot and turned around in bed - asleep in the body.  \n\n\nTwo days later I noticed scratch like burn on my foot not knowing how I got it...as time passed on, things started unfolding, Universe began delivering books to me which eventually led me to experience  short self-realization, liberaton, enlightenment for my 20th birthday, it wasnt permanent, because out of our prior out of body agreement, I just asked can I experience only for a moment, the Consciousness Awareness of God that all enlightened and ascended masters have.  \n\n\nI asked from God many things in the name of the Jesus, and I received more than I bargained for and much more than I could have ever imagined or thought possible. One day you will even watch movie about my life, read books and listen to music of my Higher Self on the world stage. There are countless famous people on world stage who sold their souls to the devil for fame, as for me, I receive much more than all of them combined ever received, for I surrendered my soul to God, and He gave me everything!  \n\n\nFor everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.  \n(Luke 11:10 - Matthew 7:8)\n\n  \nWhich of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!Matthew 7:9-11", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false,

first post and i just wanted to share an experience of mine. having read the power of now, listening to alan watts and meditating at any moment ive been able i think i kinda get it. that there is no individual me. that what we are deep deep down is the very substance that makes up the universe. and this is not seperate from anything. ive come to realise that we are one in the same with our environment. that the universe is just a devine play of forms forgetting that it is itself. ive never really been religious but some of it resonates \"the kingdom of heaven lies deep within\" or something like that. that thought isnt you and that it is an illusion that puts a split between you and your surroundings. and when you remove thought there is only experience and an awareness that seems to be infinite. it transcends you and at the same time is you. i guess its what they call the tao or the force of life behind all things or god or consciousness whatever you want. but the realisation is so absolutely liberating and joyful i want to cry. you dont try to grasp the experience because there is nothing to grasp. its realising they you are the experience.", "send_replies":
