From Dyer to Hicks to Goddard, I've gotten the chance to read from different teachers as well as done some deep research in religions, scientific studies, and just ol' plain history.   \nWhat I'm saying is I've done my homework and there is STILL SO MUCH UNKNOWN. Our world is pure magic and it is clear to me that this lifetime is so much more than meets the eye. So so much more.   \n\n\nI have come to the conclusion that this is a leaning planet. We, as a collective and as individuals, are here to learn. What we are here to lean exactly is tough to say because remembering the lesson is part of the learning process but I think it has a lot to do with manifestation. \n\nI think we're here to learn our own power. We're here to awaken our curiosity and learn just how powerful we really are.... the illusion (and I only use this word because you are a part of the creator) of this life exists so you can learn how to manifest. So you can awaken to your own powers and realize that you have full control of this ride and it can either be amazing or horrible - YOU GET TO CHOOSE.   \n\n\nBut what about the truly awful things (and even truly amazing things) that have happened in your life? Things that never crossed your mind? Well, I think it's also possible that you didn't manifest EVERYTHING. In a soul level, before you entered this life, maybe you did agree on those events because you knew they would change you and make you grow. But I see a lot of people saying that even awful life altering events (a bad car crash, the death of a dear one, a sexual assault) are caused by your mind and I don't agree with that - and even think that's a dangerous rabbit hole to go down. What I like to suggest is that maybe these events were thrown at you in order for you to learn and grow at a soul level. Because how you dealt with these events in the present moment is what really counts. How did you carry on? How did you see yourself in these events? How did you mend yourself again and continued in the path of life? How are you doing RIGHT NOW?  \n\n\nHow you deal with things in the PRESENT moment is the most important thing. You have all of the power NOW. Use it wisely and it'll bring you everything you need.   \n\n\nThis is a learning planet and it's up to you to figure out its lessons.   \n\n\nPeace and love &lt;3", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 79942, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Life altering events and manifestation", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/en24wa/life_altering_events_and_manifestation/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bryan9800", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5f3cycvh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578713347, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/en24hj/spiritual_awakening/", "gildings": {}, "id": "en24hj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/en24hj/spiritual_awakening/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578713347, "score": 1, "selftext": "Why do some people think I\u2019m crazy or weird from them?

I need to find my higher self and I believe I\u2019m on the right path, I just wanted to let some things out and hopefully get advice on continuing my journey. My 5 year relationship ended in the beginning of December, and I have been having a hard time. Without going into it, I didn\u2019t pay enough attention to her. She wants me to find myself  and figure out why I don\u2019t show affection, when I really do love her. She says maybe one day we can meet again but we both need to focus on ourselves. So I cut out drinking alcohol, went full vegan again, i am journaling and drawing again, I started focusing on being a better person in general and not such an uptight stress ball. I Haven\u2019t felt this good in a long time. Trouble is that I can\u2019t focus at times, I just keep thinking about how I want her with me on this journey and how she would be so proud of the things I am doing to better myself. I know she said we should take time to figure out why we didn\u2019t work, and that I should focus on myself but I\u2019m worried she just says that to help me move on. So that brings this problem: am I doing this for her? This is supposed to be for me. I feel good and I\u2019m doing things that help me grow as a person, but is it just for show? Is this really what I want or do I just want her back. How do I reset and know that I am doing this for me? Every time I try and meditate she is there. When I speak affirmations I have her in mind. Is it just going to take time to get back on track with myself?  This journey was once both of ours and now that I am alone I want her to hop back on. I\u2019m worried that I need to shift my focus away from her completely in order to find myself and if we were meant to be it will happen again.

The only reason im mentioning this is because I have no idea what could cause me to have a dream like this since i\u2019ve never experienced anything like it before and the only recent change was the meditation. I\u2019ve been keeping a dream journal for the past couple of months now for artistic reasons but this one was unlike any other. It felt real, and for the first time when I woke up, the real world felt fake. It was like I was lucid dreaming but I wasn\u2019t in control. Im curious as to what you guys will think and I\u2019m desperate to know if anyone has had a similar experience.\n\nSome unimportant events happened that led up to this moment here: It was sometime in the night. I had been in an awful car accident with my father and brothers. There was a bright red truck coming from the left at a 4 way intersection that made a right turn into our car, causing a huge collision. I immediately blacked out and woke up again a few seconds later. I know the side of my dads face was cut badly on the side above his eyebrow, but I never found out whether he died or not. My older brother was fine and clearly in shock speechless at what had just happened and my little brother had been knocked out as well. After this point I fell unconscious once again. I apparently was badly injured and fell into a deep coma, but to me for some reason it felt like I was dead. Before I fell unconscious I knew I wasn\u2019t waking up again and I was ok with it, but I feel like if it were real life I\u2019d be full of fear.\n\nI then woke up in a room in my house that was filled with hospital equipment. The setting was dark, the sun was out but it was like it was like it nighttime in my house. When I woke up it felt like I\u2019d been asleep for a long time. I checked my hands to see if I was alive because I was sure I was dead. My family came in overjoyed at my awakening, and they told me that I was asleep for a very long time and they didn\u2019t think I was gonna make it. \n\nI was very content with being alive. It was a warm feeling that\u2019s difficult to describe. I didn\u2019t know what exactly my injuries were but I didn\u2019t feel right physically. I felt less energetic, weak, fragile, and very shaky. Regardless, emotion wise, I still felt happy.\n\nI went downstairs and my small immediate family was all present but there was a new member, my niece. I was so happy to see her and when I approached her she jumped up into my arms and gave me warm hug. \nI spent time with my family catching up on what I had missed.\n\nI went up stairs in to my old room. I just sat at my bed alone with my thoughts as I frequently do in the real world, looking at the window and watching the sunset behind a small patch of trees. This is when I finally noticed something different. My window was much larger than it usually is and on a different side.\n\nAs I looked out the window, the trees opened up kind of how I imagine the way moses split the sea or whatever. Then a portal opened up and a male reached out to me telling me to \u201ccome home\u201d to which I responded \u201cNow is not my time.\u201d This is the weirdest part, when I responded to this spirit, person, ghost, whatever he was, it didn\u2019t feel like it was ME talking. My dream self was watching and hearing someone else do the speaking. Not only that it didn\u2019t feel like I was apart of my dream world anymore for the fraction of time he was there. This is the best I can explain it. The connection I felt with this being was extraordinary. It was beyond that of brotherhood or friendship, it almost felt like he was me. I could feel he was trying to save me but I also felt that I knew I couldn\u2019t go with him. There was a feeling of guilt that came with this too. After this he went back in to the portal and the trees came back, and I was back into my dream. My dream self thought \u201dWhat the fuck just happened, who was he?\u201d It felt completely out of place, he wasn\u2019t supposed to be in my dream and I know it but Im so glad he was for some reason.\n\nAfter this I went out to skate. The sun was out when I stepped outside. I couldnt pop any tricks because of my injures so I just rode to school. I met up with a bunch of local skaters in my area and they were all super caring towards me because of the accident. I could feel there geniuine happiness over me being alive.\n\nWe snuck into the school to skate the stairs but as they moved foward towards that area I saw a light down in an empty hallway coming from a door entrance. \nI walked into what seemd to be a guidance office and my school elementary teacher from a different state was present so I went over to say hi. As im walking towards her a random white guy in a hawaiian shirt grabbed my shoulder and said \u201cI heard about the accident.\u201d I couldnt respond to him. He then said \u201cIf I can give you some advice, learn to cook from your mother, and learn to make the food damn good too. After this point my dream ended. I just dont get it, I don\u2019t understand why anything that happened happened. Or why when I woke up the real world didn\u2019t feel real anymore.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 79876, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can anyone help me? what does this dream mean?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/emwbvu/can_anyone_help_me_what_does_this_dream_mean/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Came-ron", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_wyk5u4t", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578684347, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/emvtem/how_can_i_have_faith/", "gildings": {}, "id": "emvtem", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/emvtem/how_can_i_have_faith/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578684353, "score": 1, "selftext": "I've realized this week that I have only put my faith into a few things in this universe.\n\nI'm considering leaving my job to pursue something else, but there is a fear stopping me..

thinking that, for me personally, eating mandarin oranges is luckier to eat than navel oranges. \n\nI was at work eating oranges on a previous day and I like to peel my oranges in a specific way. I try to peel them so the peel is all still in one piece. Never was a reason for doing besides I just strongly felt to peel them like that, strong enough where I wont do it any other way. No one ever showed me or taught me to peel them like this. At work, someone noticed me peeling them this way and approached me. They spoke about how their grandma would always peel them like that and she considered it good luck. Now, if I had not; picked an orange to eat for work that day, while also working at the place I do, at the time I was at, at the same moment the other person was working, and whatever he had to work through to approach me then I would have never known (perhaps) that doing this was a form of increasing ones luck. Even if I was born minutes or perhaps seconds later than I was this conversation/experience might never have manifested itself.\n\n Is it weird for me to then intergrate that experience as fully believing that peeling oranges in one peel is lucky?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5",

but can not? What about those who neither want to nor can believe? Why can't I kill God in me?\" - Antonius Block, *The Seventh Seal*\n\nSo that title may seem ridiculous but I wanted to talk about my forays into religion/spiritual stuff and why all attempts have come up empty. The above quote is from The Seventh Seal and pretty much expresses my issue. I want to believe but can't. \n\nI grew up Christian until I was about 12, then I had an existential crisis where I realized God doesn't exist, so then life after death doesn't exist, and this coincided with another issue that spiraled into a deep depression. I came out of it with the view of existentialism (sometimes erring to nihilism) but that wasn't satisfying, but it was/is the only correct view of the meaning, or lack of meaning  of life. To me at least. \n\nNow I still have a \"spiritual\" side of me, some intangible feeling towards the universe that's hard to describe but is basically me trying to find something to latch onto. All organized religion failed, so I looked to more fringe stuff like Paganism, witchcraft, etc. and that seemed better at first. \n\nWith that stuff it's highly individual and varied, leading to one being able to sift through a lot of similar but disparate ideas about the world and metaphysical things. But as soon as the ideas leave the vaguest of descriptions they fall apart, like, reading through respected books in the community on these subjects left me realizing that these people don't really know what they're talking about or at the very least are creating arbitrary rules in the same way Christianity was. So I was closer to that intangible feeling but quickly found witchcraft and the sort too much to believe.\n\nEveryone wants to believe in something, and so do I, but nothing is compelling enough. And people can talk about \"energies\" and all this stuff in the vaguest ways but as soon as they explain their ideas in depth it falls apart. It reminds me of when people say \"the universe is so large and varied, so aliens exist\" and then someone else adds \"Did you know there are 8 alien species vying for control of humanity?\"\n\nThe first idea is easy to believe because it's vague, I'm sure a lot of people agree, but then people start to interpret what that could mean and theorize all this stuff with no evidence or basis in anything that's convincing. That's how i feel about my spirituality, it exists in some form but trying to pinpoint it down anymore just leads to a dead end. \n\nLike the character I quoted, I want to believe...but simply can't. I would like to 'kill' the 'God' in me and just accept there is no purpose or goal and it's all people afraid of that trying to make up stuff to feel comfortable about their insignificant existence. It's bitter medicine in a way, but it's truly the only thing that makes sense.\n\nI'll still attempt to mesh with some spiritual stuff, but the only parts so far that make sense are just basic principles you'd learn from basically everywhere and make sense without a spiritual/religious angle. But I'm still too afraid to fully accept reality so my journey in this regard will continue slightly longer", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false,

I live alone and pretty much do everything on my own. When I have seen girls in the past before I got into spirituality it was all sweet, I had some awesome long term gfs and flings that were fun.

All 3 would definitely describe what's going on.\n\nI'm not anymore asking anyone how I should act like. I'm currently living with my mom at 28 just had a very \"serious\" in my terms break up , an on and off going relationship with my exe, my baby died on my birthday, I kinda foreseen it. We're both Sagittarius and very \"unique\" individuals. Me being very feminine in nature but masculine and my exe being very masculine but feminine in nature. I have held jobs but always had to move on because as much as everyone says things are not personal that's a complete lie. I'm a twin flame.\n\nATM I feel like I'm hitting rock bottom. The circumstances are that I met the love of my life I found myself and lost myself. I had a daughter my exe ran etc. I have a car a bed and clothes, I'm on probation and I have enough money to cover my bills kinda. Idk what to do. I want to help but I can't, and I can. I think we know the age old questions.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone's gone through this and made it. Obviously goals are gf by my bed, food and home. But ATM I might go to jail lose my license. My mom's moving out in 3 months, probation ends by then I just lost my job. At one point I care and at the other don't. I'm trying to avoid more jail and living on the street. My exe I'd interested but she's me, my mirror me. (We're the same soul in 2 different body, me being man trying to balance the feminine, her being completely opposite) it doesn't help I'm left handed and being the angel and her being",

A little legacy video, about Thier life, that they can leave to family, friends and loved ones.\n\nThe core of each project will be a story about Thier life (put in some old photos and cam-corder footage) and perhaps express feelings about loved ones.\n\nAn additional aim will be to give them the space to, if they wish, let go of the model of who they think they are, and explore a deeper nature of themselves. Perhaps a short break from being a 'dying person' and just BE (here now \ud83d\ude09).\n\nat the moment I'm in a place of looking at 2 different approaches towards this.\n\nOne being a voluntary approach. of seeing this as service to those in the last stages of Thier incarnation. Help them in getting that  little bit closer to 'home' before they drop the body. Offer up the space to let go of suffering, if they so wish.\nI am very inspired by ram dass' work with dying people. I would possibly be looking at offering this service for free, and asking For Dana, after a project is completed. A donation which will go towards any expenses for somebody else to have this service in the future.\nAlso, with no upfront charge, it would make the whole experience a lot more relaxed. Often brining money into projects adds a whole lot of expectations.\n\nThe other approach, being more of a comercial one. Whereby I charge a fee upfront, and straight up sell a service.\n\nI am coming up in a place in my life where I am needing more money for living expenses. Car, rent etc. I work in a care home, and to work full time (minimum wage) to cover all living expenses makes it extremely difficult to live a balanced life. \nSelf development work takes up a fair bit of time and energy.\n\nOver the years I have picked up a fair few skills that, if applied to earn higher wages, could allow me to work part time and still cover living expenses.\n\n\nSo there is the situation. Has anyone here got experience of operating a comercial enterprise and still upholding spiritual values?\n\n(IE: still being able to offer a service to somone when they have little to no money)\n\nFrom Buddhism, I have occasionally heard of the 'middle way'. Perhaps in this instance, To find a balance between spiritual and materialism.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on all of this?

We have many reasons why we are giving this module, some are selfish, some altruistic, some wrathful, some caring, others excited. We do not pretend that we have a message for all of the masses. We simply are giving the module now, because now is the time.\n\nFrom this point on, we will not be speaking of us, when we say \"we\". It will be in relationship to the greater collective, you, us, and everyone. \n\nWe are coming into a time, a period, where many things that we thought were correct, or we have taken for granted as \"right\" is in decay. All the obvious things that we see within the political spheres are examples of external symptoms of the Humanity-body. The internal symptoms have been gestating for such a great length of time that now is the moment to become aware of why.\n\nOur operating systems are based on two forms: Point-Emphasis, and Space Emphasis. Currently, western minds are predominately Point-Emphasized. This OS utilizes psy-mechanica, or as you've understood it, focus. Psy-mechanica is the auric-field generator between the eyes, or third-eye, that initializes 3rd and 4th dimensional perception. This generator originates from Point-Emphasis. What some believe to be an over-development of the third-eye, is actually one of two parts of the OS synthesis. This emphasis was absolutely necessary for the development,\" consciousness\" as it's called. It is vital to understand the nature of this operating system and why it has been implemented for hundreds and thousands of years. \n\nPsy-mechanica is inherent in all things living in this density. To varying degrees does it establish itself as a guidance mechanism for 3rd density transactions. Careful consideration of the cognitive faculties that are executed in the millisecond-reaction of a fly, would indicate to what level and power does psy-mechanica present itself. However, this a fly's psy-mechanica is Space-Emphasis, and in it, shows the correlative complement of Point-Emphasis. When psy-mechanica is Point-Emphasized it narrows the 3rd and 4th dimensional realities into what is commonly called \"principle\". Within principle these two dimensions create a dynamic that caters to individuation and subsequent reality manipulation. \n\nThe western reality structure is bound to Point-Emphasis and it's child, principle. Psy-mechanica manipulated for the use of Point-Emphasis is often presented in several forms, in the 3D, it predominately is programmed into bodies that will become \"masculine\".  This may already be clear, but both Space and Point emphasis programs are being placed into any and all bodies in the present, no longer needing for \"male\" or \"female\" vessels. All masculine receptive vehicles will and have received Point-Emphasis programming into their psy-mechanica. This program was structured such that it's purpose was to create Principle, and ultimately reach it's end-cycle, which it has. \n\nThis programming was executed thousands of years ago, by forging 4th dimensional structures that would ultimately script the third density in ways that we would call, \"The West\". The West, being guided by Principle was not given the same programming of the \"The East\" which is a Space-Emphasis programming. However, both East and West have the other's programming as a subordinate OS, such that when the cycle of both programs end, and the OS synthesis begins, they will be ready to merge. \n\nThe psy-mechanica of the West constitutes of correlating vestigial scripts that can be connected to \"control\", \"manipulation\" or \"abuse\". And though vestigial, played a vital role into the execution of the programming. We are currently experiencing what some call, \"Patriarchy\" and \"Governance\", both are secondary meta-thoughts of Point-Emphasis, first being Demiurge/Godhead/God. It is necessary to clarify that Demiurge is in essence a product of Point-Emphasis. These three meta-thoughts are the resultant external symptom that appears \"problematic\", at this point in time.

My husband and I have 2 kids and we just recently moved to an apartment about 6 months ago.\n\nEverything was ok at first even though the apartment is very small for us but anyway, I started to pay attention to our Neighbors. They just started arguing like crazy in the middle of the night.\n\nThis went on for a few months until they got kicked out. Now the neighbors downstairs are starting to argue and it\u2019s pretty intense. Like infidelity and all that stuff. \n\nNow me and my husband are stressing out and arguing like crazy over finances and it\u2019s taking a toll on us. \n\nIt\u2019s so weird because if I stay in the apartment all day , the next day I\u2019ll be cranky and need to get away from the place. \n\nIt\u2019s just weird to me how everyone is arguing in this building and I just can\u2019t stand to be in here all day.\n\nIdk if that\u2019s just me overthinking, but is it possible for an apartment to have bad energy and causes relationships to go sour ?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false,

It is overwhelming from time to time.  I've shared some things, my experiences, exploits, scandals.  I was trying to humor people and more amused at how angry some people get, it's amazing.  I wasn't fearing execution this day in age but it's something I kept in mind.  Just think of what the world could be if a deity interacted and cut up with humanity, who is not an evil sicko fuck, but kind, law abiding and believes in honor and morality, who wanted to be a noble policeman.\nSince this started over the years more and more people started to come out of the wood work.  I was pre-imptively prepared for assassination, hostiliy, animosity, riots, mass pandimonium.  I had crossed paths over the years with numerous people that shared some information with me, strangers that knew who I was, quite strange.  \nI went on to try and humor people, on the forums, public exploits would lead you arrested.  Anytime during a public exploit I would usually try and keep it cool, so I didn't get arrested for public disturbance.  I haven't prepared any formal declarations or presentations.  I was being informal and trying to be as amusing as possible.  I am not all knowing or all wise, I only know what I've seen and learned over the years.  Like I was joking about visions and gnosis, I would say they were visions from an all knowing being, just what I experienced at that time.  People often inquire what I know about this or that, only what I experienced at the time - not a compendium of knowledge and wisdom.\nThese people were raging, this is not our God.  It's amazing, I'm trying to talk to you as a human who was alienated and exploited.  I'm certain I detailed everything appropriately and said most of my views were hypothetical.  I am puzzled why they get so angry, of all the asinine shit to get angry over.  They must take it seriously, I was talking about some pretty controversial stuff, I guess.  All the lies and conspiracy in this world, atrocities covered up, fortelling discoveries, esp.  It just got wrote down in my paperwork that I think I have super powers and think I am a god.  Pull your paperwork, folks, some organizations just write in whatever they want.  I was presenting my posts in a hypothetical sensibility.  Either bigotry or spite transpires, it's amazing.\nI understand cultural sensitivity and was aware some people would be offended.  Be offended at something more than someone on the internet and at more of these organizations and production companies that make the real blasphemy.  \nThere is so much spite out of context, pointing out all the pain and suffering in this world.  World hunger, corporate corruption, I understand these things.  I did grow up with a silver spoon in my mouth and know you want your 3rd world slum God.  I am certain he probably doesn't know jack shit about anything, but, be my guest.  I'm just kidding, I do not know where you may find a deity, a 3rd world wasteland slum is a possiblity.  \nWe must survive people, we do not have to practice ignorance.  Do what brings you closure, I have little for you.  I encourage your independnace and self reliance. I did not believe in piety or praying on divine intervention.  Most of religion sort of looks like a huge abomination, amid other conspiracy in the work by other potential deities.  People have their allegiences, cults, and all, no one has come forward exposing 3rd Reich loyalists posturing.  \nIt just keeps boiling down to me being called an \"arrogant prick\" by these sabatuers.  I do not know what their complex is, it's their fault.  I would have never known these people existed, they had some morbid complex with me.  I worry not for strife to break out and am patiently waiting for them to dissapear or get fucked.  \n\n\n\nTake care of yourself and survive.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 79676, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "People are animals", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/emhgib/people_are_animals/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lifeoflovehealing", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4fdb0ahf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578609918, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/emhf1i/our_sacral_chakra_and_10_minutes_of_free_healing/", "gildings": {}, "id": "emhf1i", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/emhf1i/our_sacral_chakra_and_10_minutes_of_free_healing/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "19ctcM2ygaoEzxmzFq_AJ1XfOHORkyziZfgSP_CP9zE", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/9-1SeaGx0UMYuiZpqxLtwp8ALVa8eQ2N1w260ZJyK4k.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82963314af4bc24b7c768c072947032849d38204", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/9-1SeaGx0UMYuiZpqxLtwp8ALVa8eQ2N1w260ZJyK4k.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b2fc5399266d750b0aea29c89c6bd864126409d", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/9-1SeaGx0UMYuiZpqxLtwp8ALVa8eQ2N1w260ZJyK4k.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa742553cb5387190defbaa93a291254610fcb07", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/9-1SeaGx0UMYuiZpqxLtwp8ALVa8eQ2N1w260ZJyK4k.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=69e596d600e97ce39004c009f379c0ef0d2f1845", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1578609924, "score": 1, "selftext": " \n\nIn this video I discuss the main function of our sacral chakra and some common symptoms that people experience from either an over-active sacral chakra or a blocked sacral chakra.

began getting into the concept of spirituality. I began this by deciding I wanted to learn how to meditate, so to start off I began looking up guided meditations on YouTube to help me along. I started with basic meditations and then began moving onto other guided experiences such as lucid dream hypnosis, astral projection hypnosis, past life regression, and meeting your spirit guide. However, I\u2019ve sadly never been successful with anything I\u2019ve tried so far. Admittedly, I haven\u2019t stuck with it religiously (no pun intended). \n\nI have this reoccurring problem where my brain won\u2019t shut up and I lose my focus/concentration. Sometimes this happens during the beginning but I\u2019m usually able to overcome it. The biggest problem is where I\u2019m getting really into the meditation or hypnosis and then *poof* like at the snap of a finger I\u2019m out of it. I snap right back to reality and can\u2019t get back into it no matter how hard I try. At that point it\u2019s just over and it\u2019s time for me to give up.\n\nHowever sometimes it\u2019s not entirely a mental problem. Back when I was trying almost nightly to astral project I would get these vibrations, and my heart rate would go up, and I\u2019d start feeling light and floaty and all I can think is \u201choly crap I\u2019m doing it!\u201d Then suddenly I get this overwhelming urge to swallow, and as soon as I do my focus is broken and the experience is over for me. Today I tried doing a [past life regression hypnosis](https://youtu.be/VpcqXwtjiIU) which seems to work well for lots of people. Historically I\u2019ve never had success with it but today I felt like I was getting somewhere. I was very comfy and very deeply relaxed, almost like I felt like I was on the brink of sleep and then **bam!** I snapped out of it like a rubber band and it\u2019s over before I know it. I either feel although I don\u2019t have the energy to try again, or I feel like I won\u2019t be able to capture that magic again.\n\nThis is pretty frustrating to me. I feel a very deep calling to explore my spiritual side, to understand who I am and my purpose in the cosmos but I feel as though I am stuck behind this roadblock and it\u2019s prohibiting me from venturing further. What can I do? Do I just need to practice more? Does anybody else struggle? I\u2019d really like to climb over this mountain and put it behind me so I can begin my journey of my spiritual self.\n\nTldr; Every time I try to mediate or undergo hypnosis to astral project or regress past lives my brain snaps me out of it.

You could say E-G-O stands for \"Earth-Guide-Only\". The moment we realize we are not the thoughts or emotions we move from 3D perspective to that of a 4D perspective. We \"think outside of the box\" . The name of a 4D box is called a \"TESSERACT\" or \"Hyper-cube\". A box within a box that you now have control over. The perfect \"Quantun-Observer\". This is why the Avengers , Transformers , and other movies always fight for \"The Cube\". \n\nIf you've ever reached higher realms of consciousness, you will notice that explaining this in words can be very difficult. This is why \"God\" in the Christian Bible says he is too \"bright\" to look at. Also it is why he says to not give him a name. How do you name the nameless? How do you give form to the formless?? Infinite knowledge straight from Source Energy...\n\nNOW....\nOnce in this state of awareness , we notice how certain things can be a \"CONSCIOUSNESS-TRAP\" . We notice when people are sucked into  TV ,phones, laptops computers, PHYSICAL CONSCIOUSNESS TRAPS. But what about non physical ones ??\n\nWhat about language as a \"consciousness trap\"\n\nWhen the left and right hemispheres of our brain synchronize we produce THETA &amp; GAMMA brain waves. This put us in frequency with the Universe . It puts us \"Better in Tune with the Infinite\" . HOWEVER, we use AlphaBet or \"ALPHA-BETA\" to communicate with each other. These electromagnetic sound frequencies we produce keep our brain waves in a ALPHA-BETA state. \n\nIronically this is how words are magic. This is why when you rearrange the letters of \"Words\" you then get \"Sword\". THIS is why the tongue is mightier than the sword. It's called SPELL-ing because words are SPELLS. we write(RITE) our SENTENCES in TERMS like a judge gives a criminal . We use CURSIVE(CURSES) . We VOW with our VOWELS.\n\nThis information in summary is a perfect example of why they are called \"language barriers\" . They are used to contain energy or consciousness.

We have objective reality, the paranormal, the ufo and et phenomenon, our subconscious, the cryptid phenomenon, dejavu, myth, religion, magick, channeling, and our imagination. I'm sure there's more.

I know that's a sticky concept as well. It also means seeking the truth about spirits, ets, and human origins. As far as accessing some secret or magickal skill or power like channeling spirits and ets that's a rabbit hole I'm truly lost in. Making contact with alien motherships or angels and demons, gods, goddesses, nature spirits. Again I'm lost in that rabbit hole of understanding too. I can't put my finger on it. It's like this. I either just accept that my imagination is actually real and validates onto itself things that I imagine are happening? Or I'm just broken or underdeveloped in some way. Like I'm spiritually challenged? I hear a lot of people say God told me this and some other deity told me that. I don't understand how something like that can tell you anything.

We will be starting Bhagavad-gita Verse by Verse exercise again from 13th Feb 2020.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**The Blessed Lord said: Fearlessness, purification of one's existence, cultivation of spiritual knowledge, charity, self-control, performance of sacrifice, study of the Vedas, austerity and simplicity; nonviolence, truthfulness, freedom from anger; renunciation, tranquility, aversion to faultfinding, compassion and freedom from covetousness; gentleness, modesty and steady determination; vigor, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, freedom from envy and the passion for honor-these transcendental qualities, O son of Bharata, belong to godly men endowed with divine nature.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nIn the beginning of the Fifteenth Chapter, the banyan tree of this material world was explained. The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the activities of the living entities, some auspicious, some inauspicious. In the Ninth Chapter, also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras, the ungodly, or demons, were explained. Now, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode of goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation, and such activities are known as deva prak\u1e5bti, transcendental by nature. Those who are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of liberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on the other hand, there is no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to remain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the species of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities, as well as the demoniac nature and its qualities. He also explains the advantages and disadvantages of these qualities.\n\nThe word abhij\u0101tasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or godly tendencies is very significant. To beget a child in a godly atmosphere is known in the Vedic scriptures as Garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra. If the parents want a child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles of the human being. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we have studied also before that sex life for begetting a good child is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Sex life is not condemned provided the process is used in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aconsciousness at least should not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so they may become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious after birth. That should be the advantage of children born of a father or mother absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nThe social institution known as var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma-the institution dividing society into four divisions or castes-is not meant to divide human society according to birth. Such divisions are in terms of educational qualifications. They are to keep the society in a state of peace and prosperity. The qualities mentioned herein are explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in spiritual understanding so he can get liberated from the material world. In the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution the sanny\u0101s\u012b, or the person in the renounced order of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social statuses and orders. Abr\u0101hma\u1e47a is considered to be the spiritual master of the three other sections of a society, namely, the k\u1e63atriyas, the vai\u015byas and the\u015b\u016bdras, but a sanny\u0101s\u012b, who is on the top of the institution, is considered to be the spiritual master of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as also. For asanny\u0101s\u012b, the first qualification should be fearlessness. Because a sanny\u0101s\u012b has to be alone without any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If he thinks, \"After leaving my connections, who will protect me?\" he should not accept the renounced order of life. One must be fully convinced that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His localized aspect as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is always within, that He is seeing everything and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus have firm conviction that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Param\u0101tm\u0101 will take care of a soul surrendered to Him. \"I shall never be alone,\" one should think. \"Even if I live in the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He will give me all protection.\" That conviction is called abhayam, without fear. This state of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life. Then he has to purify his existence. There are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the renounced order of life. Most important of all, a sanny\u0101s\u012b is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a woman. He is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place. Lord Caitanya was an ideal sanny\u0101s\u012b, and when He was at Pur\u012b His feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their respects. They were advised to bow down from a distant place. This is not a sign of hatred for women as a class, but it is a stricture imposed on the sanny\u0101s\u012b not to have close connections with women. One has to follow the rules and regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a sanny\u0101s\u012b, intimate relations with women and possessions of wealth for sense gratification are strictly forbidden. The ideal sanny\u0101s\u012b was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women. Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead, accepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and regulations of the sanny\u0101sa order of the life in connection with association with woman. One of His personal associates, namely Cho\u1e6da Harid\u0101sa, was personally associated with Lord Caitanya, along with His other confidential personal associates, but somehow or other this Cho\u1e6da Harid\u0101sa looked lustily on a young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from the society of His personal associates. Lord Caitanya said, \"For a sanny\u0101s\u012b or anyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back to home, back to Godhead, for him, looking toward material possessions and women for sense gratification-not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity-is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such illicit desires.\" So these are the processes for purification.\n\nThe next item is j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga-vyavasthiti\u1e25: being engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. Sanny\u0101s\u012b life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement. A sanny\u0101s\u012b is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of the qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility the sanny\u0101s\u012b goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of begging, but to see the householders and awaken them to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is the duty of a sanny\u0101s\u012b. If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he should preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with logic and understanding, and if he is not so advanced he should not accept the renounced order of life. But even if he has accepted the renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge. A sanny\u0101s\u012b or one in the renounced order of life must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-sa\u1e41\u015buddhi\u1e25 (purity) and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga (knowledge).\n\nThe next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty percent of their income to propagate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness all over the world. Thus a householder should give in charity to such institutional societies that are engaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There are different kinds of charities, as will be explained later on, charity in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of goodness is recommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance is not recommended because it is simply a waste of money. Charity should be given only to propagate K\u1e5bsna consciousness all over the world. That is charity in the mode of goodness.\n\nThen as far as dama\u1e25 (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for other orders of religious society, but it is especially meant for the householder. Although he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life unnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life, which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not require children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife. Modern society enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid the responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality but is demoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child without the purpose of serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If he is able to beget children who will be in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.\n\nSacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders because sacrifices require a large amount of money. Other orders of life, namely the brahmacarya, the v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa, have no money; they live by begging. So performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householder. They should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible for any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice recommended in this age is called sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma,Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. This is the best and most inexpensive sacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three items, namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the householder.\n\nThen sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya\u1e25, Vedic study, and tapas, austerity, and \u0101rjavam, gentleness or simplicity, are meant for the brahmacarya or student life. Brahmac\u0101r\u012bs should have no connection with women; they should live a life of celibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual knowledge. This is called sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya\u1e25. Tapas or austerity is especially meant for the retired life. One should not remain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that there are four divisions of life, brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa. So after g\u1e5bhastha, householder life, one should retire. If one lives for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five in householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the renounced order of life. These are the regulations of the Vedic religious discipline. A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the body, mind and tongue. That is tapasy\u0101. The entire var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma society is meant for tapasy\u0101.Without tapasy\u0101 or austerity no human being can get liberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice, is neither recommended in the Vedic literature nor in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Such theories are manufactured by showbottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers. If there are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore those who want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only, don't restrict the lives of their students nor their own lives. But that method is not approved by the Vedas.\n\nAs far as simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of life follow this principle, but every member, be he in thebrahmacarya-\u0101\u015brama, or g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama or v\u0101naprastha-\u0101\u015brama. One must live very simply.\n\nAhi\u1e41s\u0101 means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One should not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification. People are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply of grains, fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This injunction is for everyone. When there is no other alternative, one may kill an animal, but it should be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an ample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals. Real ahi\u1e41s\u0101 means not checking anyone's progressive life. The animals are also making progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category of animal life to another. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is checked. If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of life. So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one's palate. This is called ahi\u1e41s\u0101.\n\nSatyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal interest. In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the meaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master. That is the process for understanding Vedas. \u015aruti means that one should hear from the authority. One should not construe some interpretation for his personal interest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that misinterpret the original text. The real import of the word should be presented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.\n\nAkrodha\u1e25 means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should be tolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger is the product of the modes of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally situated should check himself from anger. Apai\u015bunam means that one should not find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a thief a thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very much offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. Hr\u012b\u1e25means that one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is abominable. Ac\u0101palam, determination, means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in some attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one should not be sorry for that; he should make progress with patience and determination. The word teja\u1e25 used here is meant for the k\u1e63atriyas. The k\u1e63atriyas should always be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak. They should not pose themselves as nonviolent. If violence is required, they must exhibit it.\n\n\u015aaucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one's dealings also. It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in the black market. N\u0101tim\u0101nit\u0101, not expecting honor, applies to the \u015b\u016bdras, the worker class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the lowest of the four classes. They should not be puffed up with unnecessary prestige or honor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the \u015b\u016bdras to offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order.\n\nAll these sixteen qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities. They should be cultivated according to the different statuses of the social order. The purport is that even though material conditions are miserable, if these qualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men, then gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental realization.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the duties of a householder and a brahmchari according to the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/em7fhc/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1613/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 79581, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 16.1-3", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/em7fod/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1613/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LordCheezIttt", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4jrcfsv2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578562739, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/em7fi1/holy_shit_i_just_realized_im_mad_at_every_person/", "gildings": {}, "id": "em7fi1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 33, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/em7fi1/holy_shit_i_just_realized_im_mad_at_every_person/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578562740, "score": 1, "selftext": "I've known I've had people issues for a long time, but recently I read the importance of forgiveness and I began reflecting on my relationships with people.

An important thing to understand is that - not every 'spiritual teacher' has your best interest at heart, or really cares about anything more than your wallet.  \n\n\nIt's a 'Guru Supermarket' out there, and opportunistic salespeople are taking genuine teachings and twisting them to appeal to people who are just starting off in their journey. It's a lucrative industry.  \n\n\nA few warning signs to look out for:  \n\n\n* The teacher looks like you'd expect a guru to look like - beard, turban, flowing robe\n* The course is tiered - two free classes and then\n* The course is described using many buzzwords - 'breathwork', 'chakras', 'synchroniciy', 'find your bliss', 'manifest your self' - of course all of these things are part of genuine routes of spiritual inquiry, but a real pathway doesn't try to make itself sound trendy\n* The course is advertised widely and uses celebrity spokespeople\n* The course requires you to buy items such as crystals, dreamcatchers, books or other paraphernalia  \n\n\nGenerally the best rule of thumb is - be on the lookout for the classes which aren't glamorous, and aren't being taught by someone who looks like they've walked straight out of a TV set.  \n\n\nSpirituality isn't about being trendy, or looking a certain way. Spirituality is about finding simplicity under all the glamour - so learn how to recognise those who are trying to glamorise you.  \n\n\nAnd all the best on your journey! &lt;3", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 79581, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Developing Discernment in Spirituality", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/em7au5/developing_discernment_in_spirituality/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TheEmployedMoth", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_431xkc93", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578556263, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/em6kv9/change_and_peoples_opinion_what_to_do_when_people/", "gildings": {}, "id": "em6kv9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/em6kv9/change_and_peoples_opinion_what_to_do_when_people/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578556264, "score": 1, "selftext": "This post can be seen in two ways. First, maybe people don't like it when they have to change their opinion of you because of our drive to form societies and communal bonds for protection. Within these groups, we like to keep rules and standards of living to ensure that everyone is invested in the survival of the group. This creates a sense of togetherness where we lose the self in the sacrifice of group cooperation and cohesion. The group demands that people behave in specific ways so they can make complex judgments about a person they don't know, based on the rules. This way, nothing is unexpected, and you can at least assume what the person thinks or does. If you have a cohesive group, you can plan for survival and how to treat others from outside the group, who might pose a threat to the established order. In all these social dynamics, you changing your character might upset the group and trigger defense mechanisms from our older, survival-focused brains. Standards of living were originally created to improve the survival possibility of a group.\n\nThis could be a reason for people not liking you to change, or they could be hiding more sinister motivations of competition, control, or power, which, in turn, unearth emotions of jealousy and envy, even hatred. People will often like you for what you can offer them, and when you no longer offer them anything similar to what you were, they cut you off, or get resentful. They want you to be successful, just enough to maintain standing in the group so they can benefit from you, but once you get more successful than them, they start to feel insecure and may have their egos challenged. They have put you in a box, a box of behaviors and expectations, that you must abide by. You have become the object, and they have become the subject, as they define what you Being should be. Their definition is based on their assumptions and observations of you, and they have categorized you into whatever description they may. In doing this, they have figured you out and determined how to treat you. When you start bettering yourself, and they don't, it highlights their short-comings and challenges their opinion. From the start, this was a toxic relationship where your growth was limited by other people's conclusions. They may have even made negative remarks, laughed at your plans, or outright told you that you don't have what it takes to succeed. Those people stagnated and stayed in the same place for years, without any growth. Don't confuse genuine criticism for this type of behavior. Some criticism is necessary, but you can tell for sure the difference between someone trying to hold you back against genuinely good advice.\n\nTo counter this, you must cut these people off. If they have an opinion of you that gets shattered by you changing for the better, and they're mad about it, cut them off. Those people were never your friends in the first place. They were simply ''just there,'' and you two depended on each other for some time, so you acted civil enough and tolerated each other, but you were never friends. When you started to move up the metaphorical ladder to greater things, they tried to hold you back, because they had attached themselves to you further down, when you were nobody. They don't want you to leave. They want you to wallow in self-pity and stay with them. You must know, and know this well, they are meant to be down there. They are meant to be at the bottom. That's their place \u2013 the lowly existence of the lazy, self-loathing, sad dropkicks of society. There is a place for everyone, and if you have a drive to change, for the better, you are not meant to be a the bottom. If you resist this drive, the sense of change that comes from deep within you, you will suffer the most painful consequences, all self-inflicted. Depression and self-loathing will take the place of happiness and accomplishment that you would have felt if you changed for the good. You will embody nihilism as you self-sabotage and destroy any meaning in your life. You must change, there is no other way, and even if it's painful, the alternative is worse. Resist your call, and you will unknowingly destroy yourself from the inside out. One of the speed bumps along the way will be people's response to you - the opinions they form. Your old friends may not like the changes you've made; again, they must be authentic changes for the better; I can't stress that enough. These people's opinions will slow you down, but you must break through them, and cut those friends off. On the contrary, you will have friends who encourage you. Keep these friends. They are the ones you need to spend time with. They will not drain your energy. They will show you that there are new possibilities. They will be your guide. After spending more time with them, you'll never want to go back to the old friends who pulled you down.\n\nEither way, understand that people's opinions of you, say more about themselves than they do about you. Let those people remain unconscious as you conquer the potential you were destined for. There are forces within the body that we consciously cannot control, and when a drive emerges from deep within, go with it, just make sure that it is authentic.\n\nThe Employed Moth", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 79573, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Change and People's Opinion - What to do when people oppose your inevitable change", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/em6kv9/change_and_peoples_opinion_what_to_do_when_people/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Expillsion", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_35gjj7k5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578555299, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/em6fpv/contacting_visitors/", "gildings": {}, "id": "em6fpv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/em6fpv/contacting_visitors/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578555299, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi,\n\nTwo years ago I was having trouble with my family, to the point where my parents acted strange and delusioned, crying over things that were not true and escalating my wondervele peace of mind and creatieve streak into something negative, making certain people think I was losing my sanity (that \u2018paradoxically\u2019, eventually, happened). The worst moment was when my drunk mother came into my room in tears saying that I stole her toothbrush, then I walked with her to the bathroom where I showed her her toothbrush that was standing on top of the sink, but my mother could not see the toothbrush standing there and kept crying and saying how awfull I was for stealing her toothbrush. The next day my mother told my family and doctor about the \u2018conflict\u2019 and they believed her, this made me angry (I don\u2019t like these mental professionals their way of thinking) and I because my lack of calmness I was going to be hospitalized again. This was not the first time things went wrong, I was hospitilised before because I was sleeping during the day and talking to my computer, and after that I was diagnosed and started experiencing psychosis, hearing voices etc. Anyway, I was sitting behind my computer one night, and I started hearing deep voices talk to eachother inside another room (our studio), speaking in A strange language I had never heard before, it sounded almost like my parents where talking to eachother in their sleep or there were people standing in the next room where I kept my drawings. I am considering I was visited by angels or that my parents were channeling spirits. My parents have always been drunks and don\u2019t remember what they do or say and they think they are just absolutely perfect.

What should I do, I wish I would\u2019ve reacted to hearing those voices and maybe meet supernatural beings and perhaps leave this planet. (Oh btw I eventually had computers operate other computers over an audio cable so talking to the mic sure didsomething) I have experienced other people being possessed by spirits too and I have grown to like being by myself, reading books, studying, watching movies. I was bullied alot and nasty people tend to hate me when I remain shy and introverted. Yet I am happy to say that the few friends I have are the most sweet and loving people. (Certainly not people who would be welcome at my families house) My life has been sick and traumatic yet I\u2019m still happy and I want to find out if those Aramaic / Enochian / Sanskrit speaking entities have something to offer me.

I've been doing it for over a month, not missing a single day, made me proud of me.  Today however i really didn't felt like doing it.

I used to smoke all the time but about 2 years ago I was smoking with some (newer) friends but we had smoked multiple times. Then out of the blue every time I would smoke with them they would yell in my face and tell me that I stink and ask me what was wrong with me. It was on every occasion that we smoked. Finally I just gave up on smoking with them. Then a few months later I went to a huge concert with a close friend of mine. I told her a little about my experiences. But I decided I was gonna smoke. So we went to the car and took a few hits from a bowl I was feeling pretty good, until we got back into the crowd. Now mind you I don't know anyone here besides my friend and we were 2 states away from home. I was standing there I felt this urge to ask the Lord for forgiveness. I know I wasn't sober minded but I felt like that's what I needed to do in that very moment. While I had my head down and talking to the Lord, I heard this lady to my left say \"look at her, she's asking for forgiveness. It's too late for her.\" After that I stood there for a few more minutes and people started saying, not directly to us, that we shouldn't be on this side. So finally my anxiety kicked in and I had to remove myself from that spot because they just kept saying that. So we go to the other side of the field, while standing in the new spot I start hearing the same thing. So I turn to my friend to make sure that I'm not completely tripping and ask her if the hears it too. And of corse she says she does. After that I have random people coming up to me and say nasty &amp; derogatory things to me. People telling me that I need to leave. People saying things that only God and I only know about. And I also had one complete stranger come up to me, looked me in my eyes and said, \"you need to smile, don't worry I hear them too.\" I can't take it anymore. I start to leave. Everyone I'm walking past is just giving me the worst looks anyone can receive. As I'm walking out of the front gate people that were sitting right in front of me look dead at me and said \"its about time you left\". After that I have smoked maybe a handful, and my head just went completely spinning out of control. I would have to leave my ex-boyfriends house because I thought that I stunk or something was wrong with me. And I felt as if everyone could see all of my sins and bad decisions.  \n\n\nI have never really been a spiritual person or attended church. But since that day I knew God was grabbing my attention.

Whether it's an ill person or someone who just chooses not to like me.  I am a lovely and wonderful person, you should love me and nestle me in your bosom.  I like bosoms, and being nestled, I'm poorly nurtured.\n\nThis was mostly hypothetical, folks, I was just playing along.  People were coming out trying to shut me down.  In the US this type of thing is generally not a problem, it's an infringement of our constitutional rights.  I am not naive, I know things like silencing people go on.  I am in the feeble stages of conspiracy, I didn't understand why so much hostility was directed toward me.  There are people out there peddlin some serious bullshit in this world, I have the competence to tell you what I am saying is hypothetical or theoretical.\n\nI've been through quite a bit of scorn over the years, whether it's bureaucracy or metaphysical stuff.  These socialist, Nazi fucks, just didn't want me to have a good life and tell you my little stories and expressions of the ego.  I couldn't verify any religious stuff other than Monotheism seems partly true.  The Gods/Arch Demons (some of them) have a symbiotic relationship and are parasitic and just evil as fuck.  Throughout the course of this they just became complete and total god damn sicko's.  Their ability to pathological lie and their own delusional nature are stunning.  They live in between realms, so they are ridiculously delusional.  I went on to talk about the gnosis, pineal gland,  seeing in between realms.  I try to keep my grip and not play off the sight beyond sight between dimensions.  Some people can function this way and work in between realms, I find it ludicrously delusional.  \n\nI couldn't verify anything, but, these beings seem to be real and are just evil as fuck.  I can't go on elicit details because I wanted to verify with facts and evidence.  They get plum flustered, mad, I do not care, these are my only petty retaliations against them.  They make ultimatums, idle threat,s suicide.  I can't tell someone to deep throat a 12 gauge, I'd love to though, that's murder 2?  \n\nBefore I let loose with the witch hunts, I expected these creatures to go back into hiding.  They are powerful liars and I am not.  I mentioned I cooperated with local authorities as much as possible, I told them the entire truth.  I am amused they can get so angry when I talk about the 3rd Reich, Bestiality, Orgy's, amid other horrific atrocities that may have been committed.  \n\nTheir followers disgust me the most, they're either brainwashed or completely submissive to these things, basically slaves.  As soon as I started to realize these things were sicko's I started to back out, turn back to Jude.  I don't believe any of that is exactly right of course, but, monotheism does seem to be partly true.  I couldn't say exactly what the truth is.  These beings constantly seem to try and appeal to the Highest and manipulate and have the candor of children, basically.  \n\n\nI wasn't a scholar or delusional psychopath.  I wasn't going for total fanatical psychopath, I wanted to look rational and law abiding and wonderful and things.\n\n\nSo basically, tread carefully when meddlin with these beings.  I can't just lot them all in the realm of Demons and Satanic ass Deadre sicko's.  I hadn't decided on what course of action I want to take.  The Law is aware of these folks and their potential crimes.  There's no need for me to go on conquest and enjoy the Glory of incarcerating these demented fucks.\n\nI should be executed or incarcerated myself for blasphemy here in the States.  I am grateful we've accomplished this much in Democracy and Liberty, amid our constitutional rights.  It would be far more difficult to tell anyone anything in previous ages. I'm not concerned with hostility or the idle threats made to my life.  I am prepared for battle and enjoying the eminence.  Anytime I think somethings about to go down I get fired up, then nothing happens.  \n\nIt's been like this for years, I have not gone on conquest.  It would be harassment or some other crap would transpire where I get screwed.  They are quite well protected and have the ability to just lie their asses off and I get alienated further.\n\n\n\nAnyway, I'm just another guy telling you Norse Myth is partly true. I said they didn't really have an organized religion, Norse Myth and Culture were basically one and the same, the Edda's came much later.  The myths derived out of their culture and folklore.  I've met a lot of people that do not like Norse Myth or Paganism, and getting to thumpin the bible or are just prejudice towards these people.  Amid some of our separatist ideologies here in the US, I'm just some dumb white trash hick that isn't supposed to know nothing about nothing.  \n\n\n\n\n\nSo long.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 79482, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Sadism and Cursing", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/em0x0c/sadism_and_cursing/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "friendlyfitnessguy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_thpw0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578525064, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/em0ndg/a_view_on_god_and_religion/", "gildings": {}, "id": "em0ndg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 43, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/em0ndg/a_view_on_god_and_religion/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578525072, "score": 1, "selftext": "Religious people can debate God and that their God is the only God and you need their God to reach Heaven. \n\nLet me ask you.

In the presence of such a vast bank of knowledge I just felt humbled, like....embarrassed for thinking I knew anything about life. \n\nGod is more complex than I could have ever imagined. I think religions have an impossible task at trying to make sense of what higher power is. I completely understand why stories are used in each religion to try and convey certain lessons. \n\nI'm not sure what to do next, I feel like I was in the presence of something way more intelligent and incomprehensible than I could ever imagine (loving, graceful, patient, wise) and I was caught naked....completely humbled.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 79462, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I came into contact with higher intelligence, just need to vent", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/elzu6f/i_came_into_contact_with_higher_intelligence_just/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "petree28", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_obta4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578516981, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/elyqup/this_video_clarified_so_much_about_meditation_for/", "gildings": {}, "id": "elyqup", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/elyqup/this_video_clarified_so_much_about_meditation_for/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "BDDYq0Tjj5tbcPdbLcDKat1sEdwCXeGZbUf1eHDRyEY", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/sMkZTngd3RzkPFZKVl0o9X-AV7EGT6S8ikr8wR3TRCg.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c3ca101c945bad38b0e5c1dfd0d56af94c62b1e", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/sMkZTngd3RzkPFZKVl0o9X-AV7EGT6S8ikr8wR3TRCg.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e8af4097303b5abcabb9ffa35dbd56a94696c9f", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/sMkZTngd3RzkPFZKVl0o9X-AV7EGT6S8ikr8wR3TRCg.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=989028c0f0ccad1cb2ba36ab6a8e20cdb380c77a", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/sMkZTngd3RzkPFZKVl0o9X-AV7EGT6S8ikr8wR3TRCg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=bd5234545e5fda6bc90475bedc1080fdb93e0710", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1578516988, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey everyone.

Use Law of Attraction in 4 Steps I have received a lot of comments.\n\nThanks for everyone who read and commented on my post, and thanks for the creator of this great community!\n\nI received a lot of questions about negative thoughts and how to get rid of negative thoughts.\n\nSome people said that they have only negative thoughts, so inspired by you guys I decided to write this post on how to change your thinking pattern from negative thoughts to positive thoughts.\n\nI have had negative thoughts all my life but in the last four years, my life has changed from really bad thoughts to only positive thoughts.\n\nI know how it feels to have negative thoughts...\n\nFour years ago I started reading a lot of science books and they helped me to understand how to change thinking patterns.\n\nThese days I only think about positive things and It gives me sooo much energy it's unbelievable.\n\nThe truth is, if you are struggling to think positive thoughts, you lack self-love.\n\nIf you are ready to think more positively then keep reading:)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How To Start Thinking Only Positive Thoughts**\n\nIf you have a lot of negative thoughts, the problem is that you are being too hard on yourself, you are lacking self-love.\n\nThe majority of people are being too hard on themselves.\n\nMedia and social media constantly makes us feel that we are not enough.\n\nWhen we think we are not enough we tend to start being too hard on ourselves.\n\nWe constantly judge ourselves until it becomes a **habit**.\n\nWhen I'm talking about judging ourselves, I don't mean self-analysis.\n\nSelf-analysis is great and as Socrates always used to say \"Know thyself\". When we make a mistake we should always analyze what went wrong and why.\n\nHowever, a lot of people don't analyze their actions, they analyze their whole being and instantly start bashing themselves.\n\nSo to be clear, when I'm talking about judging ourselves, I mean that some of us got a habit of using negative words towards ourselves.\n\nThat is not self-love. **If you are not in the habit of loving yourself, then that is the obstacle that you must overcome, in order to start thinking more positively.**\n\nThe famous investor, Charlie Munger says; \"The chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too strong to be broken.\"\n\nThis quote means that habits are easy to create but extremely hard to get rid of.\n\nIf you are in the habit of judging yourself and being too hard on yourself then you must act now in order to stop it.\n\nBeing hard on yourself does more damage to you than you could ever imagine.\n\nIf you want to think only positive thoughts, **you must learn to love yourself.**\n\nSelf-love is like riding a car. It's a skill that can be taught.\n\nRemember when you first started learning to ride a car? I bet you sucked at it, just like me and everyone else.\n\nThe same goes for self-love, it's a skill that you must learn in order to be more positive and happier.\n\nWhen you are truly happy your vibration frequency will raise and you will start to attract more positivity in your life.\n\nI want to help you to break the chains of habit and I want to help you to love yourself.\n\nLife is beautiful and you are beautiful.\n\nThere is no need to be too hard on yourself.\n\n**The first part of changing one's habits is to realize when you are being too hard on yourself.**\n\nStart listening to your inner voice.\n\n* What do you say to yourself when you put on weight?\n* What do you say to yourself when you get scolded by your boss?\n* What do you say to yourself when you feel lazy?\n* What do you say to yourself when you make a mistake?\n* What do you say to yourself when you get angry?\n* What do you say to yourself when you wake up and look in the mirror?\n\nAre you still loving yourself or are you judging yourself?\n\n**If you judge yourself then keep reading because this post will help you!**\n\nNow the first thing you must do in order to start loving yourself more is to be aware when your inner voice is judging you.\n\nYou have to observe yourself and your inner voice throughout the day.\n\nWhen you find yourself judging and being too hard on yourself I want you to do this...\n\nReplace those old habits of you judging yourself with new more positive habits.\n\nFor example, if you made a mistake at work, don't be too hard on yourself, everybody makes mistakes.\n\nInstead of thinking \"Oh I'm so stupid I made this\u00a0 mistake, I'm sorry oh I'm so stupid.\"\n\nReplace those negative thoughts with self-love affirmations like \"Everybody mistakes. It's not that big of a deal. I choose to stop apologizing for being me. I release all the negative self-talk because I love the person I am becoming.\"\n\nSo in other words, after you have identified the events that trigger the negative self-talking you need to change that old negative habit with a positive habit.\n\n**Change your negative self-talk to positive self-talk.**\n\nRemember that we think in words and we live our life by those words.\n\nSo if you use negative words towards yourself constantly, you can never truly love yourself until you fix that bad habit.\n\nNow, after you have replaced the old bad habit with a new positive habit, you need to reward yourself.\n\nOur brain has an algorithm: \u201cRepeat behavior that works.\u201d Rewards release dopamine in our brains and dopamine is a neurotransmitter that makes us feel good.\n\nSo after we have changed the bad habit to good habit, we instantly have to reward ourselves so our brain gets a signal that \"Aha! Positive self-talk makes us feel good. We should do this more often!\"\n\nWhen you combine the reward system and our brains' natural tendency to \u201cRepeat behavior that works\u201d you will have an incredibly powerful combination.\n\nWhen you create a rewarding **loop** like this, you can change your bad habits into good habits in no time!\n\nTo create this kind of habit loop, you have to identify the **Cue**, then you have to change the **Routine** &amp; after you have changed the routine you have to **Reward** yourself.\n\n**If you are not loving yourself, it's all because you have a bad habit of bashing yourself.** You have a habit of thinking negatively about yourself.\n\nYou have to break that cycle and the best way to do so is to create this kind of habit loop:\n\n1. Everything starts with the **cue**. You have to identify the event that causes you to start negative-self talk.\n2. After you have identified your cue, you have to change your old **routine** to a better one.\n3. This final stage is important. You have a **reward** yourself in order to create a long-lasting change.\n\nThis strategy will help you to love yourself more.\n\nRemember that this is what I have learned and what I have used to change my bad habits into positive habits.

I'm 22 years old and I've had problems with drinking excessively in the past. What bothers me much more then anything is how many people I put in danger while I was doing this. \n\nOnce I got caught I then went on a drunken tirade of verbally abusing the hr department and security around me. I even did the same to my parents once getting home still highly intoxicated bringing up old things they've done in the past that really scarred me. It was ignored by them , maybe because I was drunk or something. They dont seem to care about it. They continue on just living their life normally as if nothing happened.\n\nNow I'm jobless in my parents home, no one is speaking too me at all which I understand. I'm just very sorry I dont know how to repent,  I stay up in the bedroom upstairs all day and I dont know what to do with my life now. I dont know where to go.\n\n I'll find another job I have a job already lined up I'd like to save up and get out of this house and continue my journey , I just want to repent. I dont know how , no one in my house will make eye contact with me. How can I first begin to forgive myself if no one around me will forgive me first. Then i just feel like I'm telling everyone to fuck off and it doesnt matter what they think because I forgive myself.

It is something that inevitably happens once you set on to the journey of coming to a place of no-ego.\n\nOnce you realize the ego is not something you wish to serve, it will make you \"obey\" by making you feel undesired emotions, sensations, thoughts, it will do everything possible to make you submit to the mind once again and bring you back into unconsciousness where the mind has control over what is going on.  \nThe one thing you need to realize is that the mind is not going to work for you, ever, you must make it work for you. You do that by understanding the mechanisms of the mind, how it is trying to manipulate you, how it is trying to take your power from you or rather, making you believe that you have no power over the mind. Hence this post.\n\nYou believe you have no power over these thoughts, emotions, sensations, you feel like they are just overpowering you and you are so desperate that you made a thread about it. Not blaming you, I am just showing you how the mind tricked you to believe you are powerless.\n\nNow that you are aware of these tricks of the mind to keep pulling you back into this old identity of yours which was used to shaming and guilting itself (It is based on the conditioning you received as a child, teenager and adult up until this day), you were taught to feel shame and guilt, therefore your mind does these things on auto-pilot.\n\nThis is an old program of thoughts running in your consciousness right now, and you believe this program has anything to do with you. You take it personally and you feel like you need to \"deal\" with it.  \nIn fact, there is nothing to deal with. The only thing you need to realize is that you should be aware. You should be aware of all of these things appearing to happen within your being, it is not personal, it is just the conditioning you were made to believe in and abide by.\n\nNow that you are aware that you are not these thoughts, beliefs, ideas, concepts, emotions, sensations, desires, attachments and imagination that belonged to this conditioning, you can finally complete you self-realization by understanding that none of these things that you are aware of, are you.\n\nNotice how the mind even says \"You are useless\" or \"You should feel shame\", it is saying \"You\" not \"I\", it is clearly something that is not you, funny, isn't it? None of these thoughts, sensations and emotions produced by your mind have anything to do with you, and yet it seems like they are paralyzing you in this way.\n\nIt seems to paralyze you only because you gave such an importance to these emotions, sensations and thoughts that because of this importance and belief that it has meaning, **you** gave it the power to offend you.  \nYou should realize that mind (thoughts, emotions, sensations etc) can't exist without you. You are the one beyond the mind.\n\nYou can exist with nothing at all, yet the mind can't exist without you. You need to realize who is the bigger one, you need to understand that the mind has absolutely 0 power over you, unless you give it the power of your belief to affect you.\n\nWhat you should be doing is be aware of being aware of these thoughts, emotions, sensations. Do not identify your self as these things, as they are not generated by you. They have nothing to do with you. They are simply a kind of conditioning program that you are aware of. Be aware of being aware of that. That is the greatest power you have, the power to be your self, the stillness that is deep within any kind of storm and any kind of bullshit the mind is trying to \"attack\" you with.\n\nTake a look, who is the mind trying to offend? It is trying to offend that old identity you believed your self to be, once you completely dis-identify from the past, and understand that it has nothing to do with you **now**, you will be able to completely carry on with your life without any real importance given to the mind. The mind can't attack you, it can only attack an idea of who you believe your self to be.\n\nIf you understand, directly experience the fact that you are **nothing**, the mind is **incapable** of touching you. It can try and offend that old identity for how long it wants to, but it has nothing to do with you. Let it be. Keep on being your self. There is no need to give importance, significance or trying to figure out why this is happening.\n\nThey are just thoughts, emotions and sensations. You were conditioned to believe this has some kind of meaning and that these are important but this is just another conditioned belief. You in fact have nothing to do with these natural phenomena that occur within consciousness. You are the universal consciousness it self, the no-thing aware of being aware, you are beyond all phenomena which appear to arise and then disappear.\n\nNotice how everything in your life comes and goes, except that one thing. That no-thing. Which is you.\n\nIdentity, emotions, sensations, thoughts, beliefs, ideas, concepts, imagination, attachments, desires they all come, and they all go. They are unstable, inconsistent, and none of them are you. As you are the one aware of being aware of all of these phenomena. You can't be something that is coming and going. You are the no-thing aware of that. You are beyond all these phenomena, do not believe the emotions, sensations and thoughts that make you think you are scared. You **can't** be scared. It is only a thought saying \"You are scared\" or \"I am scared\" disguising itself to be you, but it is not you, it is just the mind trying to lure you back into unconsciousness. Overcome that, **Transcend** that, **realize what you truly are. The being itself.

We will be Starting Bhagavad-gita Verse by Verse exercise again from 13th Feb 2020.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is to be understood as the knower of everything, and he therefore engages himself in full devotional service, O son of Bharata**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThere are many philosophical speculations about the constitutional position of the living entities and the Supreme Absolute Truth. Now in this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Person is actually the knower of everything. The imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower, without wasting his valuable time, engages directly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Throughout the whole of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,this fact is being stressed at every step. And still there are so many stubborn commentators on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 who consider the Supreme Absolute Truth and the living entities to be one and the same.\n\nVedic knowledge is called \u015bruti learning by aural reception. One should actually receive the Vedic message from authorities like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His representatives. Here K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a distinguishes everything very nicely, and one should hear from this source. Simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient; one must be able to understand from the authorities. It is not that one should simply speculate academically. One should submissively hear from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that these living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone who is able to understand this, according to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, knows the purpose of the Vedas; no one else knows the purpose of the Vedas.\n\nThe word bhajate is very significant. In many places the word bhajate is expressed in relationship with the service of the Supreme Lord. If a person is engaged in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional service of the Lord, it is to be understood that he has understood all the Vedic knowledge. In the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava parampar\u0101 it is said that if one is engaged in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then there is no need for a spiritual process to understand the Supreme Absolute Truth. He has already come to the post because he is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He has ended all preliminary processes of understanding; similarly, if anyone, after speculating for hundreds of thousands of lives, does not come to the point that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that one has to surrender there, all his speculation for so many years and lives is a useless waste of time.\n\n**Question 1: Why the word bhajate is very significant with reference to this verse?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/elq9pt/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1519/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 79360, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 15.19", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/elq9u8/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1519/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "rvidxrz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_58pclxtu", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578469556, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/elpobu/why_does_my_heart_drop_every_time_i_think_about/", "gildings": {}, "id": "elpobu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/elpobu/why_does_my_heart_drop_every_time_i_think_about/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578469559, "score": 1, "selftext": "Didnt really know where to place this question, sorry.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 79354, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why does my heart drop every time I think about my future?

Everyone reaches the same point in the learning, and we become like everyone else, limited by what is available to learn. It is similar to creating. If we only create within the boundaries of a style or act within the norms of a society, we never create anything new. This is the limiting factor with learning and why schools are often criticized for the quality of students that they produce. When we put boundaries on learning, or on creating, we limit how far we can explore, and how far we can push culture. Often, our learning or creating is limited by what is acceptable by a certain standard. Some societies forbid the learning, or even exposure, of particular information. They also limit the areas that creativity can go by censoring content. We also get caught in stylistic dogmas of how to do things and prescribe them with a heightened sense of importance and reverence. When anything new is introduced into a system, that is from outside the norm, it's considered to be chaotic to the order of things, or, chaotic to the power that benefits from that order.\n\nWhen you can go beyond the learned and the known, then, and only then, can you truly learn or create. Otherwise, you are just learning or creating what already exists. Our systems, structures, and habits are there for a reason, to develop a correct way of doing things \u2013 they simulate efficiency, which must be respected in a foundational sense. We cannot imagine a world without order. We've tried in narratives, but these narratives still have recognizable points of focus. Pure chaos is completely unknown; it cannot be conceived. Even nature has developed simplistic orders for the survival of its cause. But this is not to say that we stay within the confines of what we know \u2013 people need to push the boundaries into the unknown. They must push culture to its limits, and beyond. Only then will learning happen: learning how far we can go, and subsequently, what we can create. If everyone did this, learned from the past, but then devoted themselves to going beyond the known, the world would have fewer problems. There would be no wars because we would have learned that war is wrong, and we would have gone beyond the learned into something new, a solution to conflict and violence. We would learn that political sabotage, narcissism, and greed are wrong, just to name a few. Perhaps, then, it is biological why we continue to be wrong in this sense - which is another conversation on drives, emotions, pleasure, impulses.\n\nFind your path and practice quieting the mind, and the answer will come. The subconscious has stored all your experiences in the long-term memory and does not let you access most of this information consciously. It's the soup to which you've added a lifetime worth of ingredients. Think of the conscious mind as the systems and structures to navigate this world \u2013 the concrete. And, think of the subconscious mind as the unrestricted possibilities of creation, as well as the irrationality of emotion \u2013 the abstract. The subconscious never says 'no,' as we would all know from our dreams. Let it speak to you and offer you its wisdom, and once it has spoken, use your conscious mind to make adjustments where necessary. To do this, we must quiet the conscious mind, and the subconscious will come through with ideas. There are many ways to do so: personally, I like to pace my house, workout, and recently, driving has been my go-to. Once the conscious mind is occupied with a menial, boring task, the subconscious can start to emerge. This will take time, and some people may not have a direction for their thoughts to flow, but it will eventually give you answers. I can direct my attention to ideas and writing, but in the beginning, I didn't have writing, and through introspection, I came to the conclusion that I need to write all these ideas down. This could be a similar occurrence for most people, where they come to the conclusion that they need an outlet, or want to pursue a passion they've always wanted to before the subject-specific ideas flow. Then, once you find your path, you start to double-down on your intention within that discipline. This act transforms you from the old to the new and is the start of potentially creating something new in the world, not just in your life. Only then, when you start quieting the mind, you start to learn, create, and go beyond what existed before. The learned is the old, and it is necessary, but to be truly creative, you must venture into the new.\n\nThe Employed Moth", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied":

The uric acid is under control with medication but I am starting to continue to have these severe arthritis flares, I am completely crippled.  I am not expecting to die from the stage 4 gout, maybe a heart attack from the arthritis, not anytime soon.  I can't even walked today, yesterday I was limping around and someone suggested disability.  This had been going on for years, my employer is very supportive of health issues, I am grateful.\n\nI've filed for disability and it's just in preparation.  I am blessed with a good job with support for health issues and long absence.  I did not want to quit work, I was content with my work at the Dining Hall, it's like Heaven everyday pretty much.  Food as far as the eye can see, and I enjoy working in food and all.  The compensation and benefits are more than adequate.\n\nIt's demoralizing, I was still continuing to work on re-enlistment.  With continuing issues I must be prepared to part ways.  I wanted nothing more than to return to military service.  \n\n\nIt's horrible, the pain and agony and sadism I have experienced.  I continue to fight through these things.  People turn to their spirituality or karma, why do I deserve these things?  I was never like that and just endured the constant bad karma over the years as if that's just life.  I have no closure year after year, stay strong and fight through it.\n\n\n\n\nCheers", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 79230, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why me, I don't deserve this.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/elgekk/why_me_i_dont_deserve_this/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Elahiyah", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3cwnaau6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578424995, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/elg9b6/beyond_mind/", "gildings": {}, "id": "elg9b6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/elg9b6/beyond_mind/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578425002, "score": 1, "selftext": "Short video on the egoic mind, how it keeps us trapped in ignorance/suffering, and how we can go beyond it. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9hGaHIxQ14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9hGaHIxQ14)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 79230, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Beyond Mind", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/elg9b6/beyond_mind/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SpiritGee", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_53bg1b59", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578424284, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/elg39l/what_do_you_think/", "gildings": {}, "id": "elg39l", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/elg39l/what_do_you_think/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578424290, "score": 1, "selftext": "What do you think is the most helpful and meaningful thing we can invest our lives on this planet?

It took one year to manifest my soulmate and she looked exactly the same as in the photo that I used to manifest her.\n\nIn the picture that I printed, my soulmate had brown hair and she was standing in front of a bookshelf.\n\nWell, my soulmate has brown hair and she has a lot of bookshelves in her home.\n\nI also imagined that my soulmate would be Sagittarius or Leo because I\u2019m Aquarius and I get really well with those two horoscopes.\n\nWell, it turns out that my soulmate is Sagittarius\u2026\n\n**STEP 3**\n\nThe next thing I did was write down my goals.\n\n**Writing down your goals is incredibly powerful\u2026**\n\nThe idea is that you write down all of your goals as precisely as you can.\n\nYou have to be incredibly precise because if you are not precise, then you will attract random things into your life.\n\nFor example, I imagined my soulmate in front of a bookshelf because I like reading science books and I would like to discuss and read science books with my soulmate.\n\nBut I never wrote down what kind of books my soulmate liked to read, I just wrote that she likes to read.\n\nSo it turns out that she reads a lot of manga, not science books!\n\nIf you want something specific, be really specific!\n\n**STEP 4**\n\nAfter completing all the steps the last thing I did was believe.\n\n**This final step is crucial.**\n\nYou have to believe that you are going to live your dream life.\n\nThe world will try to test you but you must not give up.\n\nYou have to keep believing because that is the only way.\n\nYou have to take a leap of fate.\n\nI hope that my story and these tips will inspire you to take action!\n\nStart manifesting your dream life today with these positive affirmations, I believe in you 100%!\n\nSmiles &amp; Hugs,  \n\\-Kalle, Perfect Affirmations\n\n&gt;*Believe in your dreams.*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 79208, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How To Use The Law of Attraction in 4 Steps", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/elesnf/how_to_use_the_law_of_attraction_in_4_steps/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "sandydreamguy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4en0rbn5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578415499, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ele066/cool_synchronity_last_night/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ele066", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ele066/cool_synchronity_last_night/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578415504, "score": 1, "selftext": "Last night I had a very vivid dream.

I spent a lot of time thinking/seeing people from the past (past lives) that I knew, or was. Today i dismiss it cause i dont want to get too carried away, but in the grand scheme of things, that does seem significant. I struggle with fitting in and not being respected or where I want and need and will be. If I try to share my wisdom, I feel like it's a joke to some, or that others think I'm better than then.

A good bit of time ago, in 2015, I was, through a little practice, able to sense and feel my body's magnetic field and the energy that permeates myself and everyone else. I could control what \"vibe\" so to speak I put out, so long as it was true to my stream of consciousness. I could display a variety of colors, emotions, and intent, through only touch. unfortunately, time were tough while I was a logger working with a sociopath and my best friend. The sociopath was my best friend's father. They were also both spiritually aware. Well, we can skip ahead a little. I was in a bad place and feeling insecure about my ability to defend myself and the ones I love. I made myself a beacon to be communed with by anything evil, powerful, and willing to make a deal. I made the mistake of offering the one who answered the call the ability to feed off my considerable well of energy in exchange for the strength to fight off any physical threats that may come my way. Time went on and i forgot about it. \n\nII. I had a some verbal altercations. This started just with friends. It eventually boiled over to me having an argument with a friend and I reacted too harshly. I immediately recalled the drunken deal I had made. I was certain that the parameters of this contract were not what I thought they were and I wanted out. That's when the creepy shit started. I would be on long drives on country roads and I could swear the whole time that someone was pressed up against the back of the driver's seat of my car and holding a knife to my neck. I knew who it was too. The presence was familiar. At least at that time, the entity didn't have any control over me. We were separate. I would feel that familiar dread in unexpected places and at different distances. This went on for some time, but it slowly waned until it seemed to cease.\n\nIII. About six months down the road from making the \"deal\", I was at a particularly low point. I was no longer a Logger. after a brief stint couch surfing, I found myself working as an electrical apprentice, living with a family of alcoholic gypsies. I laid my head down to rest in the trailer between the barn and the house. I had been staying there for at least a few months by this time. I got mildly intoxicated with my \"roommates\" and decided, as I usually did, to call it an early night. Just as I began to fall asleep, I could swear I felt that familiar malevolent presence hit my toes and slowly creep up. It began consuming more and more of me. It was at my shoulders now and in my passive state, it crept up my neck, and across the bass of my skull. When it reached the crown of my head, something amazing happened. At what seemed like the exact moment I was both about to be fully taken and fall asleep, a blinding gold and white presence touched the last iota of me. It commanded my entire field of view. I pushed back the darkness in a manor that seemed effortless. it pushed past my toes at whatever had been trying to take advantage of my weakened position for eradicated from the room. As soon as it was done I fell into a deep sleep. I woke the next morning an I felt strong; ready for anything. I threw on my work clothes and gathered the necessary tools for the day and opened the door of my trailer. I looked down to the step and saw a white feather, front and center. I was in shock for a moment, but I went about my day. I didn't feel anything from the malicious entity for quite a while after that.\n\nSo, I know this sounds bat shit crazy, but it is true to what I experienced. I left a multitude of details out and I also left out my theories about what I think really happened. If you have any questions, just ask. Sorry, I'm not a good writer. typos may be abundant.\n\nTL;DR I made a deal with a dark entity, eventually rejected it, and then was saved by some other entity in my darkest hour.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 79126, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Weird trilogy", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/el8cxz/weird_trilogy/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "spaceang3l", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_54yj2j1w", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578379812, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/el7vuw/twin_flame_guidance/", "gildings": {}, "id": "el7vuw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Relationships"}], "link_flair_template_id": "ff48d9ae-c323-11e7-bd5d-0e515489cb82", "link_flair_text": "Relationships", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/el7vuw/twin_flame_guidance/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578379814, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello :) \n\nI\u2019ve met someone who I believe is my twin soul.

In fact, I had no idea that awakening was a *real* thing, I had already dismissed it as a self-applied term people used to feel superior. No, I triggered my realization in much the way that one triggers an avalanche - being in the right place at the right time (okay, maybe the wrong place and time for the avalanche). \n\nIt was late at night, and while I procrastinated going to sleep I sat and stared at a wall. I was feeling especially introspective after I'd had an extremely vivid dream the night before. I had watched, from several feet away, a lioness take down a baby wildebeest. The experience impacted me as deeply - perhaps even *more* deeply - than if I'd experienced the same thing in waking life. I became intrigued by what it was that made such dreams possible. How was it that I was producing extraordinarily real-seeming stories in which I was both the creator and audience? \n\nNormally, at this point in my life, if I had a question I tried to solve it rationally. This time, however, I had a suspicion that I could learn more by observing my own mind than doing research. I started with a question which I could more easily answer in my waking state: where did mental images come from? I distinctively remember the moment that I discovered that I was capable of creating an image in my own mind. The first thing I imagined was a Tonka truck. So many years later, I was now repeating the experiment. After picturing a few things and seeing how detailed I could make them appear to me, my awareness was now fixed on the imagery in my mind. I could see the process of my mind more clearly than ever, because I had for once held one of its inhabitants still under my microscope for more than a few seconds. The sensation of mind became more absurd to me than anything I'd ever considered. \n\nThis was the moment I entered into a realm which no words could touch. It felt as though everything had been scrubbed clean, washed free of all the impurity of thought so they could present themselves to me as they really were. I began to tremble. Immediately, I knew what I needed to see. I picked up my phone and googled \"Hubble Telescope HD\", clicking on the first photo I saw. There it was: the evidence was laid before me. And for the first time I could bring myself to look at it, really understanding it. Yet, I felt none of the dread I'd expected. Instead, tears ran down my cheeks.  Written across the dust of the cosmos I no longer saw my own insignificance; instead it radiated with its own significance. My place in the scheme had been revealed. A bubble which emerges at the base of a waterfall, only to rejoin the stream a moment later. But how wonderful a stream to be a part of! \n\nIn the following days I was kissed by my surroundings. Every thing called to me, begged to be admired and adored. Every person was imbued with their own energy, from the way they waited in line to the clothes they wore. All things were exactly right, in a way that words can never capture. \n\nIt doesn't matter exactly how I triggered this realization. The point is that it could have been anything; the moment we consider the reality of a thing with open enough of a mind, we are confronted with the inherently stupefying nature of reality itself. If we accept that it is stupefying, and therefor evades our intellect's attempts at capture, then it reveals itself fully to us. Instead of trying to use the human-centric intellect we've created to grasp our experience, we relate to it without any barriers up.

I feel as though I\u2019m learning more everyday and gradually becoming closer to my true self.

I meditated in the sense that I was physically still taking the subway and walking the streets of the city, but in a meditative state. I did this for the first last week.\n\nOn the second day something pretty incredible happened. I reached a blissful state of consciousness as I was walking around Washington Square Park, so I sat down on a bench for a bit. My eyes were open this whole time, and all the sudden a man started walking towards me. He sat down right next to me, telling me that my spiritual energy pulled him towards me. He said he could feel my love. \nI\u2019ve been in and out of NYC for years and I can hardly remember any strangers\u2014besides homeless people\u2014coming up to me like that.\nI couldn\u2019t believe what had happened.\n\nThen two days later something similar happened. I was in a deep awakened state, walking through Central Park. Maybe 100ft (30 meters) away I spotted a man who was walking in my direction. He was looking at me, and I at him. I could see the love in his eyes. As he approached me, the whole time looking in my eyes, he smiled and extended his arm. I extended mine and he then shook my hand and walked off. I was in awe.\n\nI\u2019m just a regular dude, so this was really a \u201cWTF\u201d experience. \n\nHas anyone experienced anything similar to this? \n\nI don\u2019t ever seek out attention and I think I\u2019m a pretty humble guy so I don\u2019t know what to make out of this.

Even Alan Watts was an alcoholic, and I am beginning to see why. If you love yourself too much you\u2019re egotistical. If you try too hard you\u2019re not just \u201cgoing with the flow,\u201d even if the effort stems from love. If you care too much you\u2019re setting yourself up for suffering, even though what drives us to care is love. If you hope too much, you will suffer. If you ask for help, you get nothing. You can get signs from the universe, but it\u2019s wrong to ignore them and also wrong to think you\u2019re special or meant to follow them because that is also egoic. Even if you wanted to follow, there is no path to follow. The moment you think there is a path you are believing in a concept and not seeing the world as it really is.\n\nThis whole practice is all about destroying your ego and humbling yourself until you\u2019re just a weak, pathetic joke. That is what I have become. A miserably isolated, weak, pathetic joke that has just lets people walk all over me and get away with it in the name of humility and forgiveness because I believed that the same thing inside them was what is inside me. But it is not. There is nothing inside me, I am just a super complicated ball of force fields and empty space. And God is everywhere, including here, but if so, why won\u2019t he just fix this huge mess? Australia is ON FIRE. If all of this is just for fun like everyone says then why is it so terrible, almost evil? If nothing actually matters, and none of this is real or has a set purpose and is just some big dumb game then why does it suck so badly? \n\nNo matter how hard I try to do the right thing, I am a failure. Even if I am God in disguise, I am still stupid and still a failure. I can\u2019t even tap into this great big thing that I have always been a part of. If everything is me, how can I not even belong with myself? even though all I want is to go home. To rest. To be set free from this Hell. If I get to decide my reality like these posts keep saying why can\u2019t I decide to be different? For this world to be different? I try to stay positive but sometimes it feels disingenuous like I am ignoring the very real pain of this planet for my own comfort. Why would I want this for myself? Why would any of us want this? We can\u2019t even communicate with one another. Mankind is drowning in our fear and our inability to understand one another. And then there are psychopaths and serial killers and child rapists and famines and floods and fires and fucking cancer. Why would God abandon us here??????????? Why do we have to suffer to be worthy of being loved? Even if the universe is magic, it\u2019s cruel as well. I don\u2019t fully belong anywhere. I\u2019m overbearing and crazy, and through all of this effort I have put into loving myself, how much longer can I ignore the response I get from others, or lack there of. I\u2019m not awakened or enlightened, I am stupid. I am still just a confused, lost, scared monkey. If I have ever said anything or tried to give anyone advice, ignore it, because I know nothing, and I deserve nothing, and I am ultimately nothing. Even in this damned post I talk too much and can\u2019t just shut my stupid ape brain off and be concise. I just hate being this. Whatever this is, I absolutely hate it. Downvote me all you want.

But last year around May I started to learn about spirituality. I was raised in a Christian house but I have always questioned it. In May, I was at my lowest. I had thought about ending it all because I hated myself and my life that much. Spirituality made me think about things so differently and I began to practice meditation and self love. I started to get better. Not even a full year later I feel like a completely different person. I\u2019m hungry for knowledge and truth. And for the first time I feel like I\u2019m in control while also letting go at the same time (if that even makes sense). But I\u2019m running into a situation. \n\nIm battling my old beliefs of Christianity with spirituality. I believe in God and even did research on what Jesus actually taught. And I had a good balance of the two but I keep seeing things about synchronicities being evil and I see tons of them all day every single day. And about how things like opening your third eye is evil. (Which I haven\u2019t done but a lot of spiritual people say they have). And it makes me second guess myself. And I\u2019ve seen some people say they left spirituality because of demonic presence and because God was calling them back. It\u2019s all a mess to me right now . How can something that pulled me out of depression be evil? I guess I\u2019m just wondering who else has gone through something like this and what\u2019s a way you handled the situation? I feel like I\u2019m going crazy going back and forth in my head. I\u2019d like to have a peace of mind again.

Like, that often feels like it\u2019s a corner stone in these kinds of discussions.\n\nHowever, is that really the case? Perhaps service is the best case scenario, but can we still have a completely meaningful existence fully engaged in this incarnation without really, directly doing anything altruistically? \n\nMy hunch is, yes.

In the material world every entity is fallible, and in the spiritual world every entity is called infallible.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nAs already explained, the Lord in His incarnation as Vy\u0101sadeva compiled the Ved\u0101nta-sutra. Here the Lord is giving, in summary, the contents of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra: He says that the living entities, who are innumerable, can be divided into two classes-the fallible and the infallible. The living entities are eternally separated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When they are in contact with the material world, they are called j\u012bva-bh\u016bt\u0101\u1e25, and the Sanskrit words given here, sarv\u0101\u1e47i bh\u016bt\u0101ni mean that they are fallible. Those who are in oneness with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, are called infallible. Oneness does not mean that they have no individuality, but that there is no disunity. They are all agreeable to the purpose of the creation. Of course, in the spiritual world, there is no such thing as creation, but since the Supreme Personality of Godhead has stated in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra that He is the source of all emanations, that conception is explained.\n\nAccording to the statement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there are two classes of men. The Vedas give evidence of this, so there is no doubt about it. The living entities, who are struggling in this world with the mind and five senses, have their material bodies which are changing as long as the living entities are conditioned. One's body changes due to contact with matter; matter is changing, so the living entity appears to be changing. But in the spiritual world the body is not made of matter; therefore there is no change. In the material world the living entity undergoes six changes-birth, growth, duration, reproduction, then dwindling and vanishing. These are the changes of the material body. But in the spiritual world the body does not change; there is no old age, there is no birth, there is no death. There all exists in oneness. It is more clearly explained as sarv\u0101\u1e47i bh\u016bt\u0101ni: any living entity who has come in contact with matter, beginning from the first created being, Brahm\u0101, down to a small ant, is changing its body; therefore they are all fallible. In the spiritual world, however, they are always liberated in oneness.\n\n**Question 1: What is the difference between fallible and infallible living entities ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/ektf03/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1516/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78913, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 15.16", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ektfje/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1516/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "cyanideshawty", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_fs47a52", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578311293, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ekt3ng/can_anybody_reccomend_any_books_on_spiritualism/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ekt3ng", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ekt3ng/can_anybody_reccomend_any_books_on_spiritualism/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578311295, "score": 1, "selftext": "I don't read much at all but would like to believe I have a moderate size of vocabulary but still nothing too difficult of a read.

Particularly on the subways as it is a very great point of access to a captive audience.\n\nI have a pretty strict rule with homeless, as I can become quite empathetic; if there is a way I can be certain to help, I will. Generally, this means giving food, clean water, or running them through a store for a day of groceries. I do not give cash as I don't want to support addiction.\n\nToday, a man of able body and youth (25-30) got on our subway car, Peter. In our visit so far, if someone pipes up on the subway, it is to collect pocket change. Peter called for attention as he's probably done all day.\n\n\"Excuse me everyone, my name is Peter. I'm sorry to bother you today, but it is Sunday and I need your help. I am living on the streets, in the subway. I am trying hard to get a job, but as you can imagine, I don't have a shower, I don't have a phone, and I can't print a resume.\"\n\nSomething whispered internally, 'keep his gaze,' and I listen to my intuition. While he continues, he and I share moments of direct eye contact:\n\n\"It is difficult, it feels impossible for anyone to give me a chance, I struggle to go on, and I am alone. But if you can give, even pennies, pennies put food in my stomach and confidence for tomorrow. Thank you so much, and God bless.\"\n\nAnd so, the deep whispers again, 'carry him and tell him to keep his head high.' A man hands Peter a few singles and Peter makes his way past my wife toward me. We lock eyes and as he passes I touch him a sec and say, \"I have no money to give, but keep your head high as a change is coming, and God bless you too.\" We break eye contact as he passes and he says, \"Thank you, it means so much to hear that.\" I'm hardly composed anymore. \n\nWe're off at the next stop. I try to catch Peter's glance again but he's already moved onto the next car. Walking out into the city air, I'm hit with the gravity of the burden asked to carry out of the bowels of the rail line. Tears fill my eyes and my wife asks if I'm okay. I ask her to give me a few minutes, as she understands.\n\nA quick prayer, \"Spirit, please bless and release the burden that I carry up for Peter out of the underground. Let him carry some of my hope, optimism, blessings, and promise of a better tomorrow, and let me carry out and release his dispair, disregard, shame, and potential addiction. Give it, him, and I love and release the burden of these weights.\"\n\nI know addiction, I know it's side effects, and to a small but tolerable degree, I empathically carried a little of that sting all day, the demon of it in my mind, but such to let it release far away from Peter and the crowds of fellow unassuming tourists.\n\nBut, here's the lesson, the growth for me; Peter, for a moment in eye contact, was not that homeless man, but Peter, the deciple to Jesus. He looked at me and dared me to embody the lesson of the living Christ to say, \"Tell me it will be okay, even if you are uncertain and terrified yourself. Lend me your strength, and carry my sin a moment.\" Peter was the teacher for my growth in a deeper understanding of wwjd?\n\nTo even have a chance encounter of a shared moment, a transfer of energetic frequency, a second of humanity between one another shook me all day long. It shook me to tears and I'm up in the middle of the night retelling the encounter for you.\n\nSometimes a deciple, a Peter, comes across our path in an unconventional way and asks us to look within and feel a little bit of Christ ourselves, even if and especially when it is really hard. For in that moment of connection, we say to another, \"You are not alone, even if in the struggles.\"\n\nThank you for reading, and God bless.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78860, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A deciple's lesson", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ekq2rj/a_deciples_lesson/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "nothereo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1pgyr726", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578291267, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ekpyhx/lost/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ekpyhx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ekpyhx/lost/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578291271, "score": 1, "selftext": "2019 was a profound year for me.

I kicked bad habits (nicotine, alcohol, and shitty sex) and completely changed my lifestyle. I focused on becoming a better me, and I did.

While I definitely see the benefits of positivity and positive thinking over negativity and hostility, I have found myself to be in a position where I am in the middle of both and to accept reality as it is.\n\nThere are so many depressing news stories about human rights abuses and suffering such as famine, concentration camps, authoritarian abuses and so many more. But my experience in real life and encountering many human beings and animals has proven to me how genuinely nice and amazing living beings are. They are full of love and care and my ratio to good people vs terrible people has been overwhelmingly sided with the good people.\n\nAfter walking this spiritual path and finding connection with God, the universe and our little blue planet I have found myself to be in a completely neutral position on my feelings towards the world. I just am.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, this doesn't mean I'm just sitting here and waiting for the world to get better. My two biggest goals in life are spiritual liberation and to leave this world in a better position than what it was when I was born.\n\nIt is hard to explain. I accept the chaos and terror in the world and I don't let it affect me negatively. But I also accept that we can be a part of the solution and that millions, if not billions of us are striving towards a better world.\n\nI am in this neutral position because I accept that everything and everyone is also a part of me. I am you, you are me. We are all united as one being but the world, politics, media, etc makes us fall under the illusion that we are separate and we have differences.\n\nThat is why I accept myself in this position. I feel like I am part of the whole and not just an individual. I feel like I am part of the entire ocean of the universe and I am not distinct from anything that exists on this plane. That is how I accept myself to just be. I am neither happy nor sad. I am neither black nor white.

Since my whole awakening started I feel really disconnected. I try to understand people and I can't. I try to get close and yet it feels like something is blocking me from them.

I'm not the center of the universe i know this, yet for some crazy reason it seems like when I think something or realize something suddenly everyone and everything reflects this, not in small ways but in huge ways. I'll have an epiphany and suddenly I'll hear people saying a huge wave came by and many people experienced the same thing. It's had me questioning everything. Is there free will? Are thoughts just chosen for us? Could it be that my realizations instead cause huge waves in reality and others thus feel it? (I know it's ridiculous.) Yet it seems as things continue things get stranger.\n\n Sometimes like right now I feel like saying \"fuck all this, I choose my destiny, I don't need to change anything. It's my choice what I do alone.\" And just living life as anyone else forgetting this whole spiritual stuff. The syncronicities are getting closer together almost instant. The dreams becoming more intense, vivid, and turning up in real life. It feels like in a weird way I'm jumping between realities with each thought and that may be why everything shifts. \n\n Does anyone else feel this or something similar?

So a couple of weeks ago I picked up this introductory philosophy book which I have been enjoying thus far and am about in the middle of it. Anyway, so I've been looking for 'Be Here Now' recently and after calling up basically every book store there is (it's not a big country so that can be taken literally) I came across one book store that had one copy of it left (which I now own) and I was ecstatic and in a sense, I felt like it was a sign up until a few hours ago..\n\nI haven't started reading the book yet besides having it for a couple of days as I'm trying to finish of that Philosophy book first but I've looked through it and for those of you who own a book the book you know just how amazing the book actually looks. So anyway, it's nearing midnight and for some reason I decide to show my dad just how cool the book actually is and he after he looks over at me he asks me to hand him the book, and this is where it begins. After I hand him it he starts skimming through it and just zones out on me and focuses on the book. He then tells me I can't read the book before ***he*** actually reads the book since this is '*one of those books that tries to trick you into going against your own faith*'.

Idk if anyone has seen this but sometimes in the middle of the night I will see almost like starts but in the shape of long lines and sort of I think it's a blue color rotate they seem to almost spin like gears each interlocked with one another but without touching. They sometimes hover up and down while doing this endlessly, if I really focus I can sort of cause them to spin in opposite directions or change their location. It's weird but they aren't in this dimension, they're transparent and almost like a shadow and the color is almost \"wave like.\" When I make effort to pay attention to them I notice the ringing in my ears which has been constant since this awakening started will change or become more pronounced.\n\n It seems to happen easier in the dark, it's definetely real because it will happen even unconsciously all the time. Sometimes while seeing them I'll also see \"shadows\" dark by from place to place, never anything bad, sometimes I wonder if they are after images of people in time, or imprints, such as seeing an after image of yourself from earlier that may have walked in that area if that makes sense. Sometimes I'll wake up in the middle of the night and look as if something may be there but I never see anything, lately vivid dreams which I usually never have or a dream within a dream, I used to go to sleep and wake up without dreaming but now it's changed. \n\n I don't consider myself psychic I just know that since this started from a NDE last year I've started to gradually notice these things as I progress spiritually. I'll also say this, in the past i have experienced psychosis due to a mental health condition during severe states of mind impairments ever since I was young. From seeing portraits shift and warp, almost trying to speak or breath, shadow people, feeling presences, and sometimes sudden great fear that i don't know what it could be yet there is nothing there. Yet the thing is I have been on medication for a while now, I'm more stable than I ever have been before and I know the symptoms if psychosis and when it's starting yet this is very very different. Idk how to explain it but I know it's not my mind because in such states what I see is very \"physical\" if that makes sense and related to my state of mind at the time, after over 13 years dealing with it I know it well.\n\ni assumed maybe it's due to my third eye because I can sometimes feel it vibrate or \"pulse\" in a sense since my kundalini started up.\nAnyway has anyone experienced any of this?

While in the present moment, there are literally no problems at all.\n\nBy the present moment, I do not mean what your identity might think; \"My life is shitty right now! I have the problems right now! This isn't helping me!\"\n\nRather, I mean if you would turn off all these thoughts, and be present for a few moments. See really what is going on around you. Be aware that you are aware. For a few moments unplug, and just exist. Be. The identity you think you are has created many problems, but it is only the identity that has these problems. Not the being. And you **are** the being.\n\nSo by unplugging and reconnecting with your own source, the beingness itself, the sense of \"I Am\", you can actually see life with clarity. Life does not really have a story, the only story there is, is the one created by the identity which itself is made up by the mind. There is no actual necessity to keep these stories up. In fact, it only takes away from your natural presence, the beingness within you. Every single thought you identify your self with, you vibrate lower, and you are less present, and less likely to see life for what it truly is.\n\nIf you were to unplug and see what is actually going on in the present moment, like waking up from a dream of stories, you would see that peace, love, and joy are all present. They are the natural perfume of the beingness. And you **are** that beingness. It is not separate from you, it is all you are actually. You just **think** you are something else, and you identify with these thoughts. Are thoughts necessary for being and functioning in the world? Definitely not.  \nIf you are thinking all the time, you have nothing to think about except thoughts. \\~Alan watts\n\nThis means, that you are not seeing life, you are not thinking about life, rather you are generating more thoughts about already existing thoughts. You have a thought saying \"I am not good enough\" and then you start thinking about \"How do I become good enough?\" but you are just thinking about thoughts. Not about reality. You have completely identified with these thoughts, and now instead of being, you are thinking. That is not our nature. We do not **exist** to think. We exist to be.  \nYou do not have to stress about anything, blame anything, want anything, desire anything, imagine anything, conceptualize anything, think of anything, you are **allowed to just be.**  \nSimply be, be alive. Exist. When you are in your natural effortless state, your perfume is joy, love, peace, and compassion.\n\nWe are such a wonderful being, you are allowed and it is **good for you** to actually be present, with your own beingness. The less we are (being) the more we suffer. It is not necessary! Suffering is believed to be something that is literally life itself.\n\nSuffering is rooted in thoughts, beliefs, ideas, concepts, emotions, sensations, imagination and attachments that you are identifying with. If you were to not identify with anything at all, you are literally **unable** to suffer. Your beingness **can't suffer.**\n\nYou are currently identifying as an identity made up by your mind, which is a \"sufferer\".  \nNow, you are aware of this identity \"sufferer\", otherwise you wouldn't be identifying as this sufferer.\n\nThis inevitably means that there is an awareness of even this awareness otherwise this observation couldn't be made.\n\nSo there is an identity you are currently identifying as, a \"sufferer\".  \nThere is an awareness of this identity.\n\nThen there is **you, the beingness**, the witness of the awareness. You, the witness of awareness were simply conditioned to believe you are the identity while in fact you were the witness of all of this movie since forever and will be the witness forever. You are **always the beingness**.\n\nAnything you can be aware of is not you. Go back within and see what can be seen. Identity is seen. Awareness of identity is seen. Awareness of the awareness of the identity, can that be seen? No. That is you. The beingness, source, universal consciousness.\n\nAlways remember, life (the universe) takes care of life (you, beingness, also the universe). You are not abandoned, nor can you be abandoned. There is no separate being to be abandoned. Just as you are being, the whole universe is being.\n\nThe identity you are identifying as can feel and think it is abandoned, but that identity is not you. It is just a thought in your mind that you are identifying as.  \nYou, the beingness, did not come to this life, nor will you ever go. You are eternal. You are the observer of this movie.  \nWhat appears to be a problem is the identity you currently identify as. The identity is naturally creating problems, it is its job you could say. It is just thinking and conceptualizing and imagining more problems in every moment. That is why your life seems overwhelming. Instead of being aware, you identify as this identity that is **bound** to have problems.\n\nYou completely bought the stories, ideas, concepts, thoughts and beliefs that this identity has created, instead of simply **being aware of them. Your nature is to just be. Be aware.** You forgot your nature because of the society which conditioned you to be some kind of identity. You have a choice to take a step back and stop identifying as this made-up identity, it is not essentially what you are. Not even close.\n\nBe aware. Live. That is your purpose. Exist. You are already supreme, you are already perfect.\n\nWhen people say \"The universe has abandoned us, he did not create as complete, he did not create us whole!\" you already know who is making up these thoughts and beliefs. It is the identity. Well, even the identity is not abandoned.\n\nImagine if there was no at least some sense of peace, some sense of beingness, all these made up stories by the mind and all these problems that are created by the identity, it is unlikely you did not kill your self yet. Something is holding you from doing that. There is a higher power which makes you feel as if not all is lost. There is something taking care of you, even when it seems like your whole existence is just one big problem and suffering. Somehow you keep on living.\n\nThat is the sense of beingness. The beingness itself is complete, it is whole, it is joyful, it is loving, it is compassionate, it is peaceful, and **you are it**. You simply keep identifying the beingness (you) with a suffering identity!  \nYou do not need, want, or have to be anything nor do anything. The universe truly, made you perfect. Whole. Complete.\n\nThe beingness does not need to work on anything.  \nThe identity will work on one thing, and another thing will come up. It is a never-ending, vicious cycle of suffering. (But only the identity is suffering, not you, the beingness!)  \nThe key is to simply be aware of these thoughts, stories, beliefs, ideas, and not identifying and interacting with the mind when it presents all of this nonsense. It means nothing at all.  \nThe identity is taking life and its story extremely personally. That is the root of its suffering. The identity is **bound** to taking things personally, as the identity itself is **personal**, but the **beingness** is **impersonal**. The beingness **takes no offense, can't experience suffering, it can't even die.** The only thing that appears to be able to \"die\" is the identity. As this body returns back to earth, it means truly, the end of this made-up identity. There is no rebirth into this identity.\n\nWhat is meant by the saying \"Die before you die\" is exactly this, the death of the identity, while you, the beingness still are. The death of the identity, will set you free. You will be able to experience life wholly, not limited by an identity with certain beliefs, thoughts, ideas, concepts, imagination, attachments, desires, emotions and sensations. You can be completely free of all of these things. You **can reverse conditioning, and be the natural beingness that you are, all the time.**\n\nTruth is, life just is. It has nothing to do with the identity you are currently identifying as.  \nSimply, be, observe and enjoy the movie. This perspective will let you see everything clearly, and from there life will be blissful, full of joy, full of love, full of peace, full of compassion because truly, that is the nature of your being.  \nDo not continue to entertain all of these stories in your mind. **Stop** interacting with them. **Be still**. **Do nothing.**  \n**Stay as awareness, as your self.**\n\nPeople might say \"This is spiritual bypassing\", and you must not believe them! These are the forces of the universe trying to hold you back from experiencing the true beingness, the completeness that you are, I am not asking you to believe me. I am asking you to see for your self. There is no reason to listen to someone who is here just to deny the truth.  \nThe ones who deny the truth, are suffering **so much** that they can't even see a different perspective, it does not have to be you. You can unplug, see for your self that existence is beautiful. You already know all of this in your heart, you just need to remember your self.

I came from an interview that didn't go well, and I was a bit bummed out because it would have paid well. I was staring at the drinks but wasn't there mentally. It was \u201clights on nobody home,\u201d so to say when a distributor approached me and asked me if he can help me find something. I said, \u201cNo thank you.\u201d I then picked something and left. Halfway to my car, in the parking lot, a premonition slapped me in the face and said, \u201cThe right answer was yes you can help me. You can help me get the job you are doing.\u201d I don't know what distributors are paid today, but back in the day, they did very well. Also, he was an employee of a well-known beer distribution company.\n\nThe moral of this story is you must always be ready and always be looking. This is done by staying intentional and in the now. Had I remained focused on my intentions to find a job that pays well, along with my intentional role of being an excellent choice for hire, I would've asked the distributor that question at the blink of an eye. It would have been automatic. I was already moving; I just needed to be able to know when to intercept or know when I was being intercepted. Unfortunately for me, I didn't.\n\nAs you move through the day, you must remain within your intentions when interacting with anyone or anything. Keep your intentions in mind for everything you do. Look for the doorways everywhere you go. Make sure your intentions are always in check, so you are always prepared. Make sure you are always ready and always expecting, so you are in the moment. \n\nHere is another thought. There is a saying that goes, \u201cleave your problems at the door.\u201d When I had the dreadful experience of promoting penny stock, the boss would say this several times a week. What this means is if you left for work right after an argument with your spouse, you need to remember that when you walk through the door of the building you are a promoter. If you remain an irritated spouse during work, you will waste the day. You must remember to update your role as the shifts take place into new segments of your day.\n\nWhat this means for you is during your endeavors you will have to hit your \u201crefresh button\u201d many times throughout the day. Just like movies and plays have scenes, so do you throughout the day. The difference is that, on average, you have more scenes that are much shorter than that of a movie or play. Every time you enter a new scene or segment, you must reevaluate your role. You must evaluate whether you want to remain in the role you are in at the moment or shift to a different one. \n\nLet's say you are going to a store to buy something. Scene one would be your driving into the parking lot to find a space. Scene two would be you getting out of your car and making sure it's secured. Scene three would be you walking through the parking lot towards the store. Scene four would be you entering the store. Scene five would be you looking for the item you came for. Scene six would be when you find the item. Scene seven would be you walking towards the cashier to pay for the item, and I will stop there because I think you get the idea.\n\nEvery time you begin to move through a new scene or moment you must hit the refresh button and acknowledge the most appropriate role that will suit your overall intentions according to the new scene you are in. It's tedious at first, but as you keep consciously practicing, it will become second nature to you. There is a unique essence or feeling you should get from each of your roles. Remember to focus on the feeling and essence they spark up so every time you reach a new scene you merely need to revisit the emotion. This will be more instant and effective than mentally voicing words all day long. Reviewing a list of titles for your intentional roles while feeling the essence of each title will help you access the feeling quickly. Transitioning between titles will also be swift.\n\nAlways be in real-time. Stay away from your mind and your daydreams when you are in \u201cready mode.\u201d Stay away from yesterday and tomorrow, and get back to your senses right here, right now. The more intentional you are, and the more ready you are, the more natural and quicker your transition will be. Even when you are alone and want to tune everything out and relax, be your role in \u201crelaxed-mode.\u201d Who you are when no one is looking is the defining factor of your true character and ultimately your destiny. As long as you are conscious, you are manifesting. Who you are when no one is around also determines who and what you are going to attract into your life. \n\nTrillions of things are happening every second on this planet. Even when you are alone, you are still influencing unseen events with your gravitational presence in this universe. Therefore, it is best to always be the role and state of mind that belongs to the life you desire because there is constant movement and change happening around you at all times. By staying in your role and the moment, you allow whatever opportunity that is around the corner to come into your reality and join you to have an experience with you. Staying in your role and intentions at all times (Even when you are alone) contributes to the manifestation of your choice. Right now, you are resonating with the universe, and right now there are many shifts and setups taking place to balance with your resonance. As long as you are conscious, you are creating your tomorrow.\n\nStay open to all options and avoid being selective when you are in pursuit. Do not only be your desired role when you think you are in more promising circumstances according to your limited awareness of all possibilities. You do not know how it will come to you, or when, and will always be a bit surprised when your attractions come through. Therefore, by knowing this, it makes sense to always be on guard and ready to interject or be interjected. \n\nLet your walls down and intentionally flow with reality. Attempting to hide behind a \u201cproverbial wall\u201d while selectively interacting with who you think is a good prospect, is ineffective. This is because you will only know who the real prospects are by letting everyone in your space for evaluation. If you hide behind a wall and interject selectively, you will grow bored as the many opportunities continue to pass by.\n\nYou must tell the universe what you want to experience and let the universe take care of the rest. The universe works efficiently when you fully allow the energies to flow into your life. If you are a moderator of the flow, then you are placing restrictions on the possibilities and sabotaging your opportunities. If you choose to micromanage, then you will end up in a stagnant place. \n\n\\~Nicholas D\u2019Arezzo\\~", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78660, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Once You Are Intentional, You Must Stay Ready 24/7!", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ekch96/once_you_are_intentional_you_must_stay_ready_247/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Reignoffire9", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ceunhmh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578224186, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ekbyb3/i_dont_think_this_world_is_for_our_life_lessons/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ekbyb3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General"}], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 106, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ekbyb3/i_dont_think_this_world_is_for_our_life_lessons/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578231102, "score": 5, "selftext": "People who practice/learn spirituality love to say we're here to learn life lessons.

Your thoughts create your reality. At least 95% of everything you think and do is subconscious (unconscious), therefore without reprogramming yourself you're destined to the fate of whatever you've been programmed with. This means the world is merely a reflection of our collective state of consciousness (our repetitive thoughts and feelings).\n\nIf you're interested in spirituality you've probably experienced this yourself. The law of attraction and other psychic abilities are real. I've experienced it so many times in the most extraordinary, improbable circumstances I'm no longer sceptical of it.\n\nIn fact, psychic abilities and this kind of phenomena is literally scientifically proven (look up physicists such as Dean Radin and Russell Targ). The evidence is so strong, if this were some ordinary thing it'd be accepted as a fact. But since it's controversial, most scientists, religion, and people dismiss it. Which is dogma.\n\nThe implications of this are fucking insane. Not only does this mean all of us can radically transform our lives and do anything we want, but we can change the world. How many people look at awe at the accomplishments of people like Elon Musk, Einstein, or whoever, and think \"I wish I could do that\" whilst failing to realise the same capacity is within every single one of us. We merely habitually fail to use it because our subconscious programming does the opposite.\n\nWithout fear mongering or dwelling in the details, the world is clearly fucked up at the moment. I used to be extremely depressed. Thinking about how messed up the world was filled me with despair and hopelessness. I literally felt like Elliot from Mr Robot, only except I wasn't schizophrenic nor did I do hard drugs. I became obsessed with seeking the truth and figuring out how we can change the world.\n\nAnd after a ton of research and crazy experiences I realised we can turn things around. From hopelessness my faith in this has reached an absolute. With the internet, computers, and other technology, this is probably one of the only chances we've had to actually change the world. As messed up as this world may seem, what puts things into perspective is to realise the world is merely a manifestation of consciousness. If you raise consciousness, reality will rearrange itself, it's a natural law.\n\nTherefore a low state of consciousness is the root cause of literally all the world's problems. Environmental destruction, war, animal agriculture, literally every problem that plagues our world today can be boiled down to this. Activism for these issues is extremely important, but people aren't seeing the bigger picture. Because even if you solve one of these individual issues, you're merely putting a band-aid on the symptom. The root cause (low consciousness) will manifest an infinite number of problems until it's addressed. Therefore focusing on anything but the root cause is futile.\n\nThis means at a fundamental all we need to do is raise consciousness. Everything else is just details. That's all we need to focus on. Even if the world seems like an absolute mess, once we realise this one fact we can free ourselves. We can never stop focusing on the vision for our ideal future. We won't let the outside world dictate our inner world, because we know the inner creates the outer.\n\nBy accessing higher states of consciousness, we can do anything. This is proven with flow state, a state of consciousness which makes you 5 times more productive, 4-7 times more creative, and you learn 2 times faster. It's probably even higher, this is just what we know so far. That's literally superhuman, it means you could get more done in a day than someone does from 5 days of work.\n\nFlow is something everyone experiences, just to varying degrees. And the only difference between those we deem extraordinary, like Nikola Tesla, Einstein, or whoever, is they're operating on a different level of consciousness. They think differently. Therefore if we think the same way, we will get the same results. We have the same capacity as them, we've merely failed to realise it because of the shitty programming we've unconsciously adopted.\n\nBy reprogramming ourselves, we can become superhuman. Ever seen the movie Limitless? Life can literally be like that (maybe not as dramatic, but still very close to it).\n\nThe problem is despite all this information being available, barely anything has happened. Many of us know about things like the law of attraction, meditation, and psychedelics, which are all keys to achieving this state of consciousness. Yet barely anything has happened, otherwise we'd have a complete revolution by now. The world would be a utopia. For true change to occur we literally need to become superhuman. We need to be the next Elons, Teslas, and Einsteins. And it needs to happen super fast, the world is in crises and we need to make a miracle to have any chance in fixing things.\n\nMany of us know about things like meditation, psychedelics, psychic abilities, and the law of attraction, yet we barely exercise our abilities to the full potential. The only reason is because we don't know how, otherwise we would've done it already.\n\nSo why hasn't anything happened? It's because there's no formula. There's no strategy to get from A to B. So many of us already take action and want to change, which means we have enough people to make an impact, but our efforts are misdirected. All of this knowledge is all over the place. Different books and sources have a piece of the puzzle, yet no one has assembled the puzzle into the bigger picture. Which means few people except those who have the diligence to study all the material end up doing it (almost no one).\n\nBut by piecing together the best science and wisdom covering all these components to achieving peak states of consciousness, an extremely effective, concise formula can be devised. Something so effective anyone can do it and experience extraordinary results. This makes it accessible to everyone instead of just the few who manage to figure it out themselves. No longer will we look up to those we admire to change things, we'll take responsibility and do it ourselves.\n\nWhich is exactly what I've been doing. I've figured out most of the formula, which includes things like meditation, psychedelics, and proper nutrition. It tells you exactly what to do, a precise routine you can follow to become superhuman as quickly as possible. Free and accessible for everyone. Not a bunch of paid courses telling you only a little bit, I despise that, this needs to be accessible to anyone, even those in third world countries. All of this knowledge needs to be compiled and condensed into one, cohesive, free formula so anyone anywhere in the world can do it. Knowledge is something no authority can suppress, it will free everyone.\n\nImagine a group of us achieving extraordinary feats like Wim Hof who has broke 26 world records, doing what we once thought was impossible. Or Nikola Tesla, who is responsible for plenty of the technology we have today. No one will be able to ignore us. And because this is a formula anyone can adopt, word will quickly get out. It'll snowball. Everyone else will do it. The impact of even a small group of people operating at this level will be exponential, so powerful it can overcome all the incoherence in the rest of the world. We'll be so fucking effective we can change everything within a relatively short period of time. Imagine a room of 1000 Nikola Teslas and what we could accomplish. We'd be unstoppable.\n\nNot only will our actions create massive change, but merely operating at that level of consciousness sends shockwaves throughout the collective consciousness. It's proven groups of experienced meditators focusing on peace has statistically significant improvements for peace, the economy, and other variables. The problem is once they get up from meditation it doesn't persist. But by making this a lifestyle we all live every second, it makes it persistent. It makes it more accessible to others because our energy affects everyone, even if it's on an unconscious level. And the impact of us coming together isn't cumulative, it's exponential. So if even 1000 of us go all in and do this, we can literally change everything and start a revolution.\n\nThat's phase 1. Once consciousness is raised, the world will naturally rearrange itself into a world of peace and harmony.\n\nPhase 2 is actually building a new world. This is what much of the activism and research today has been focusing on, but without phase 1 barely anything happens, which is why the world has barely changed yet. It's why there's politics debating over things that should've been dealt with decades ago, like stopping the use of fossil fuels.\n\nPhase 2 is a world with absolute peace and abundance for all people, no poverty, no war, no bureaucracy, absolutely no bullshit. All social and economic systems will be redesigned from scratch. And because everyone will be highly conscious, everyone will welcome this change. There will be a high level of consensus between us because we're operating on the same frequency, instead of all the bullshit politics we have today. All of us will be leaders instead of having corrupt politicians and psychopaths running everything.\n\nThe project is still a work in progress because it's a huge project, but I felt the need to share this right now. I've been working on this for a very long time, but the world is in crises and the word needs to get out as soon as possible. So I'm releasing this here prematurely for those of you who want to get on board before it goes public.\n\nI know there's tons of bullshit on the internet and plenty of people have tried to initiate movements before, so I understand if you're sceptical. This isn't a cult either because some of the core principles involve questioning everything and being your own leader (the opposite of what cults do). That's why I'm doing this, because after so much searching I could never find a movement that puts this all together properly. If those movements were effective, they would've worked by now. So if this resonated with you, you truly believe you're limitless, and you want to change the world, then I want to talk to you. I know there's more of us out there. For now I'm putting together a community of us who are 100% committed to this and want to get started right now. I'm going to share everything I've learned so far and exactly what to do. Then we're all going to do it, provide feedback, and refine the formula. As more and more people do it, eventually it'll be so effective anyone can do it and achieve results quickly. Which is the fuel that will enable rapid transformation, without this progress will be slow.\n\nIt's going to involve changing everything about your life. You're going to have to radically transform your lifestyle and question everything. Your old personality is going to be shed. So you need to be prepared to do this. This isn't some thing where you can meditate for 5 minutes a day and expect to get results. You need to go all-in. This isn't an exclusive or elitist movement, everyone is invited, but ideally the first people should be serious because this movement needs a solid foundation. So if this is you, I want to talk to you. Message me and I'll add you to the group.

Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nIn this verse the identity of the living being is clearly given. The living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord-eternally. It is not that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated state becomes one with the Supreme Lord. He is eternally fragmented. It is clearly said, san\u0101tana\u1e25. According to the Vedic version, the Supreme Lord manifests and expands Himself in innumerable expansions, of which the primary expansions are called Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva, and the secondary expansions are called the living entities. In other words, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva is the personal expansion, and the living entities are separated expansions. By His personal expansion, He is manifested in various forms like Lord R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, Vi\u1e63\u1e47um\u016brti and all the predominating Deities in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. The separated expansions, the living entities, are eternally servitors. The personal expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the individual identities of the Godhead, are always present. Similarly, the separated expansions of living entities have their identities. As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities have also fragmental qualities, of which independence is one. Every living entity has an individual soul, his personal individuality and a minute form of independence. By misuse of that independence, one becomes a conditioned soul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated. In either case, he is qualititatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is. In his liberated state he is freed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of transcendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated by the material modes of nature, and he forgets the transcendental loving service of the Lord. As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence in the material world.\n\nThe living entities, not only the human beings and the cats and dogs, but even the greater controllers of the material world-Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, and even Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. They are all eternal, not temporary manifestations. The word kar\u1e63ati(struggling or grappling hard) is very significant. The conditioned soul is bound up, as though shackled by iron chains. He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent which is driving him in this material existence. When the mind is in the mode of goodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion, his activities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance, he travels in the lower species of life. It is clear, however, in this verse, that the conditioned soul is covered by the material body, with the mind and the senses, and when he is liberated this material covering perishes, but his spiritual body manifests in its individual capacity. The following information is there in the M\u0101dhyandi-n\u0101yana-\u015bruti: sa v\u0101 e\u1e63a brahma-ni\u1e63\u1e6dha ida\u1e41 sar\u012bra\u1e41 marttyam atis\u1e5bjya brahm\u0101bhisampadya brahma\u1e47\u0101 pa\u015byati brahma\u1e47\u0101 \u015b\u1e5bnoti brahma\u1e47aiveda\u1e41 sarvam anubhavati. It is stated here that when a living entity gives up this material embodiment and enters into the spiritual world, he revives his spiritual body, and in his spiritual body he can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. He can hear and speak to Him face to face, and he can understand the Supreme Personality as He is. In sm\u1e5btialso it is understood that in the spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured like the Supreme Personality of Godhead's. As far as bodily construction is concerned, there is no difference between the part and parcel living entities and the expansions of Vi\u1e63\u1e47um\u016brti. In other words, at liberation the living entity gets a spiritual body by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\nThe word mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba\u1e25 (fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord) is also very significant. The fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is not like some material broken part. We have already understood in the Second Chapter that the spirit cannot be cut into pieces. This fragment is not materially conceived. It is not like matter which can be cut into pieces and joined together again. That conception is not applicable here because the Sanskrit word san\u0101tana (eternal) is used. The fragmental portion is eternal. It is also stated in the beginning of the Second Chapter that (dehino 'smin yath\u0101) in each and every individual body, the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is present. That fragmental portion, when liberated from the bodily entanglement, revives its original spiritual body in the spiritual sky in a spiritual planet and enjoys association with the Supreme Lord. It is, however, understood here that the living entity, being the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is qualitatively one, just as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold.\n\n**Question 1: What is the difference between Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva and the living entities ?**\n\n**Question 2: What information is given in this verse from M\u0101dhyandi-n\u0101yana-\u015bruti: sa v\u0101 e\u1e63a brahma-ni\u1e63\u1e6dha ida\u1e41 sar\u012bra\u1e41 marttyam atis\u1e5bjya brahm\u0101bhisampadya brahma\u1e47\u0101 pa\u015byati brahma\u1e47\u0101 \u015b\u1e5bnoti brahma\u1e47aiveda\u1e41 sarvam anubhavati ?**\n\n**Question 3 : Why the word mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba\u1e25 (fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord) is very significant with reference to this verse ?

I woke up once  and when i fell back  to sleep it continued.\nBut that dream wasn't  the weirdest  part of the night. After that dream i properly woke up and i couldn't  get back to sleep.  So as i was just laying  there in my bed( totally awake) something inside me said that there  is an  entity  here. And has i heard it straight away i felt  my whole  body starting to vibrate. Felt like huge energy  flow. Also my ears started  whistling  really loudly. I checked thw clock few mins after it started and it was 3:33.  The vibration lasted like a hour and only ended when i left my bedroom. I even took my tourmaline with me to calm down.

I read the new trending post about social anxiety on this subreddit right before walking into a store. \nThis store, mind you, was in a spooky, dark parking lot, trees were cut down. People were walking around in hoodies and dark clothing. \n\nI felt a little unsafe but decided to walk into the store smiling with thoughts like \"they're just people too, and they're probably just like me, were all the same on the inside.\" \nImmediately, I'm greeted by THE most CHEERFUL and kind sounding greeting I've heard in a long time by the security guard. \n\nAt work this dude is extremely egotistical and was getting mad that I didn't agree with him about something. He got mad, I felt bad.. i thought to myself something like \"what's the trick here God? What am I to learn from this? The lesson is always to experience and to be present through all things.. good and bad. But why is this happening. Wish I knew.\" \nRight then I found a package labeled \"Buddha's blessing\". And it kinda freaked me out for a sec. \n\nTook me 45 mins to get shoes today, after I finally bought em the girl at the register said she had the same pair. \n\nEarlier tonight my dad and I were talking, he said I could be a pastor or minister, I said \"no, but i may be going in something similar to that route\" \nThat security guard I met at the store who was super kind actually turned out to be a minister. \n\nI'm regularly getting 4-5 synchronicities a day. This has been happening for a couple weeks now. \nBut ive been so depressed. I feel like I'm failing as a person. My grandma is in the hospital, I've been taking care of her since I was 18 and if she goes I won't have a house to live in. I'm not making much money. I don't feel I have true friends.\n\nI feel like there's so much negative energy inside me. I've suspected I may be possessed because even when my intentions are good I still sometimes act or do little subtle things that aren't. \nI feel like there's something inside me that wants me to suffer. Whenever I meditate I can feel it inside me. In fact, almost anytime I can feel it. It feels like it doesn't want me to love, be successful or be happy. \nThere's so many negative emotions inside me that I suppress, I was taught it's not okay to feel bad so I just hold everything in that isn't good or peaceful, then when I get time to meditate all those negative emotions finally come up and I can let go of them. \nI feel like my body has so much trapped hate and judgement. There's something inside me that wants me to fail. Maybe it's just depression because I used to be addicted to drugs for years. \nAll I know is, God is definitely real, and I definitely feel like he makes that apparent to me and yet I suffer so much and judge, and hate so much. \nThis is something I see so commonly in people that go to church too, they try to make all their actions pure but they end up being weird because that evil we all have inside us has to come out somehow. \nI don't know, I'm lost. I wish I could find someone that understands, someone to help me, a friend, I wish I could do it for myself too because I don't want to burden someone with my problems, I don't want people to have to take care of me. \n\nI've done what I've considered to be morally good in a lot of ways, and yet I carry around so much guilt and shame and I'm afraid to love. \n\nWhat is this? Do I shed my need to be good and embrace my dark side? Do I find a way to purify the negativity inside me? \nIn 28 days I'm going to do an Ayahuasca journey after prepping daily with meditation and mindfulness and letting go of trauma. I can't seem to let go of this one basic trauma though... This basic trauma is all the way hidden in the very back.. I think it's just being human. It's so deep I cant even understand what it is or what it's connected to. It seems to just be suffering or living itself. Was I meant to be born to suffer? \n\n\nThis post was mostly just a vent.. wish I had the answers at this point.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78636, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Synchronicities keep coming up, but I'm so depressed..", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ek8usa/synchronicities_keep_coming_up_but_im_so_depressed/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Yung-Mick", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7kcwmwl", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578202129, "domain": "self.spirituality", "edited": 1578205636, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ek8p3e/question_regarding_synchronicities_and/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ek8p3e", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ek8p3e/question_regarding_synchronicities_and/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578219981, "score": 1, "selftext": "I made a post earlier asking about the number 222, but it was a bit vague.

Since I was a little kid, I've been obsessed with trying to save humanity from itself. Now I'm working in the nonprofit sector, and it feels like it's not enough. \n\nYesterday, I was agonizing over the prospect of World War III on the horizon. But more so, my deep fears about the enviornment, poverty, injustice, slavery, and other human rights violations plague me. My anxiety was out of control, and I think that's what prompted me to some new realizations yesterday. \n\nSo, there is an infinite number of alternate universes and timelines, and we all just happened to incarnate and experience this one, although we've experienced all of them because we are God. \n\nAnd so God has created all of this technically, in the human way that we destroy everything, God made that. So that brings me to some questions. Is all of this, then, \"God's will\"? Does God even care that much about all of this, or is this just an experiment?\n\nSo in that way, there's actually no reason to worry. What could you possibly worry about? These are the circumstances in this particular slice of the pie. But you've been in all of the pieces, you caused it all to happen. We are infinite, and time is not linear, so whatever has already happened, etc etc. \n\nI believe God is love. But God is also everything. When we experience love, we experience God. So our goal, in everything, should be to spread love. But does that mean that we should also work really hard to bail humanity out of the situation that we've gotten ourselves into? Is part of my self actualization process like that of MLKJ or Ghandi, dedicating my life to a social issue, or is it just \"being\", which is what I believe that God is?\n\nI'm starting to understand the phrase \"Life is meaningless.\" It matters, that we are experiencing this timeline at this time, but in another way it doesn't really matter that much. In this timeline, humanity has identified with ego and will destroy itself. Do we accept that, or do we use our weight to fight against it? \n\nWhew this question is wearing me out, and I'm not sure I completely articulated it in a coherent way, but I'm interested to hear your thoughts and what your approach is.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78633, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Try to save the world or let it burn?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ek8gew/try_to_save_the_world_or_let_it_burn/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "creamedbrie", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4et5p53m", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578200251, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ek8cpz/what_do_you_do_in_your_free_time/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ek8cpz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ek8cpz/what_do_you_do_in_your_free_time/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578219016, "score": 2, "selftext": "My apologies if you've seen this, positing in multiple subs as I'm not desperate for change. \n\nI'm asking you all what you do in your free time, or what you hobbies and interests are. \n\nQuick backstory: my life changed a lot this year and who I am changed a lot.

Then I took them and tried to make a pyramid color-wise, just randomly. There were the perfect number of bears for the pyramid. Six reds, six whites, four greens, three yellows, and two oranges. I used the sixth white at the top and used the other five for the second to last row.

The outermost is the body, the gross form of man, in which are the instruments of sensation, such as the eyes, nose, ears, and so forth. This eye is not the organ of vision; it is only the instrument. Behind that is the organ. So, the ears are not the organs of hearing; they are the instruments, and behind them is the organ, or what, in modern physiology, is called the centre. The organs are called Indriyas in Sanskrit. If the centre which governs the eyes be destroyed, the eyes will not see; so with all our senses. The organs, again, cannot sense anything by themselves, until there be something else attached to them. That something is the mind. Many times you have observed that you were deeply engaged in a certain thought, and the clock struck and you did not hear it. Why? The ear was there; vibrations entered it and were carried into the brain, yet you did not hear, because the mind was not joined to the organ. The impressions of external objects are carried to the organs, and when the mind is attached to them, it takes the impressions and gives them, as it were, a colouring, which is called egoism, \"I\". Take the case of a mosquito biting me on the finger when I am engaged in some work. I do not feel it, because my mind is joined to something else. Later, when my mind is joined to the impression conveyed to the Indriyas, a reaction comes. With this reaction I become conscious of the mosquito. So even the mind joining itself to the organs is not sufficient; there must come the reaction in the form of will. This faculty from which the reaction comes, the faculty of knowledge or intellect, is called \"Buddhi\" First, there must be the external instrument, next the organ, next the mind must join itself to the organ, then must come the reaction of intellect, and when all these things are complete, there immediately flashes the idea, \"I and the external object\", and there is a perception, a concept, knowledge. The external organ, which is only the instrument, is in the body, and behind that is the internal organ which is finer; then there is the mind, then the intellectual faculty, then egoism, which says, \"I\" \u2014 I see, I hear, and so forth. The whole process is carried on by certain forces; you may call them vital forces; in Sanskrit they are called Pr\u00e2na. This gross part of man, this body, in which are the external instruments, is called in Sanskrit, Sthula Sharira, the gross body; behind it comes the series, beginning with the organs, the mind, the intellect, the egoism. These and the vital forces form a compound which is called the fine body, the Sukshma Sharira. These forces are composed of very fine elements, so fine that no amount of injury to this body can destroy them; they survive all the shocks given to this body. The gross body we see is composed of gross material, and as such it is always being renewed and changing continuously. But the internal organs, the mind, the intellect, and the egoism are composed of the finest material, so fine that they will endure for aeons and aeons. They are so fine that they cannot be resisted by anything; they can get through any obstruction. The gross body is non-intelligent, so is the fine, being composed of fine matter. Although one part is called mind, another the intellect, and the third egoism, yet we see at a glance that no one of them can be the \"Knower\". None of them can be the perceiver, the witness, the one for whom action is made, and who is the seer of the action. All these movements in the mind, or the faculty of intellection, or egoism, must be for some one else. These being composed of fine matter cannot be self-effulgent. Their luminosity cannot be in themselves. This manifestation of the table, for instance, cannot be due to any material thing. Therefore there must be some one behind them all, who is the real manifester, the real seer, the real enjoyer and He in Sanskrit is called the Atman, the Soul of man, the real Self of man. He it is who really sees things. The external instruments and the organs catch the impressions and convey them to the mind, and the mind to the intellect, and the intellect reflects them as on a mirror, and back of it is the Soul that looks on them and gives His orders and His directions. He is the ruler of all these instruments, the master in the house, the enthroned king in the body. The faculty of egoism, the faculty of intellection, the faculty of cogitation, the organs, the instruments, the body, all of them obey His commands. It is He who is manifesting all of these. This is the Atman of man. Similarly, we can see that what is in a small part of the universe must also be in the whole universe. If conformity is the law of the universe, every part of the universe must have been built on the same plan as the whole. So we naturally think that behind the gross material form which we call this universe of ours, there must be a universe of finer matter, which we call thought, and behind that there must be a Soul, which makes all this thought possible, which commands, which is the enthroned king of this universe. That soul which is behind each mind and each body is called Pratyag\u00e2tman, the individual Atman, and that Soul which is behind the universe as its guide, ruler, and governor, is God.\n\nThe next thing to consider is whence all these things come. The answer is: What is meant by coming? If it means that something can be produced out of nothing, it is impossible. All this creation, manifestation, cannot be produced out of zero. Nothing can be produced without a cause, and the effect is but the cause reproduced. Here is a glass. Suppose we break it to pieces, and pulverise it, and by means of chemicals almost annihilate it. Will it go back to zero? Certainly not. The form will break, but the particles of which it is made will be there; they will go beyond our senses, but they remain, and it is quite possible that out of these materials another glass may be made. If this is true in one case, it will be so in every case. Something cannot be made out of nothing. Nor can something be made to go back to nothing. It may become finer and finer, and then again grosser and grosser. The raindrop is drawn from the ocean in the form of vapour, and drifts away through the air to the mountains; there it changes again into water and flows back through hundreds of miles down to the mother ocean. The seed produces the tree. The tree dies, leaving only the seed. Again it comes up as another tree, which again ends in the seed, and so on. Look at a bird, how from; the egg it springs, becomes a beautiful bird, lives its life and then dies, leaving only other eggs, containing germs of future birds. So with the animals; so with men. Everything begins, as it were, from certain seeds, certain rudiments, certain fine forms, and becomes grosser and grosser as it develops; and then again it goes back to that fine form and subsides. The whole universe is going on in this way. There comes a time when this whole universe melts down and becomes finer and at last disappears entirely, as it were, but remains as superfine matter. We know through modern science and astronomy that this earth is cooling down, and in course of time it will become very cold, and then it will break to pieces and become finer and finer until it becomes ether once more. Yet the particles will all remain to form the material out of which another earth will be projected. Again that will disappear, and another will come out. So this universe will go back to its causes, and again its materials will come together and take form, like the wave that goes down, rises again, and takes shape. The acts of going back to causes and coming out again, taking form, are called in Sanskrit Sankocha and Vik\u00e2sha, which mean shrinking and expanding. The whole universe, as it were, shrinks, and then it expands again. To use the more accepted words of modern science, they are involved and evolved. You hear about evolution, how all forms grow from lower ones, slowly growing up and up. This is very true, but each evolution presupposes an involution. We know that the sum total of energy that is displayed in the universe is the same at all times, and that matter is indestructible. By no means can you take away one particle of matter. You cannot take away a foot-pound of energy or add one. The sum total is the same always. Only the manifestation varies, being involved and evolved. So this cycle is the evolution out of the involution of the previous cycle, and this cycle will again be involved, getting finer and finer, and out of that will come the next cycle. The whole universe is going on in this fashion. Thus we find that there is no creation in the sense that something is created out of nothing. To use a better word, there is manifestation, and God is the manifester of the universe. The universe, as it were, is being breathed out of Him, and again it shrinks into Him, and again He throws it out. A most beautiful simile is given in the Vedas \u2014 \"That eternal One breathes out this universe and breathes it in.\" Just as we can breathe out a little particle of dust and breathe it in again. That is all very good, but the question may be asked: How we, it at the first cycle? The answer is: What is the meaning of a first cycle? There was none. If you can give a beginning to time, the whole concept of time will be destroyed. Try to think of a limit where time began, you have to think of time beyond that limit. Try to think where space begins, you will have to think of space beyond that. Time and space are infinite, and therefore have neither beginning nor end. This is a better idea than that God created the universe in five minutes and then went to sleep, and since then has been sleeping. On the other hand, this idea will give us God as the Eternal Creator. Here is a series of waves rising and falling, and God is directing this eternal process. As the universe is without beginning and without end, so is God. We see that it must necessarily be so, because if we say there was a time when there was no creation, either in a gross or a fine form, then there was no God, because God is known to us as S\u00e2kshi, the Witness of the universe. When the universe did not exist, neither did He. One concept follows the other. The idea of the cause we get from the idea of the effect, and if there is no effect, there will be no cause. It naturally follows that as the universe is eternal, God is eternal.\n\nThe soul must also be eternal. Why? In the first place we see that the soul is not matter. It is neither a gross body, nor a fine body, which we call mind or thought. It is neither a physical body, nor what in Christianity is called a spiritual body. It is the gross body and the spiritual body that are liable to change. The gross body is liable to change almost every minute and dies, but the spiritual body endures through long periods, until one becomes free, when it also falls away. When a man becomes free, the spiritual body disperses. The gross body disintegrates every time a man dies. The soul not being made of any particles must be indestructible. What do we mean by destruction? Destruction is disintegration of the materials out of which anything is composed. If this glass is broken into pieces, the materials will disintegrate, and that will be the destruction of the glass. Disintegration of particles is what we mean by destruction. It naturally follows that nothing that is not composed of particles can be destroyed, can ever be disintegrated. The soul is not composed of any materials. It is unity indivisible. Therefore it must be indestructible. For the same reasons it must also be without any beginning. So the soul is without any beginning and end.\n\nWe have three entities. Here is nature which is infinite, but changeful. The whole of nature is without beginning and end, but within it are multifarious changes. It is like a river that runs down to the sea for thousands of years. It is the same river always, but it is changing every minute, the particles of water are changing their position constantly. Then there is God, unchangeable, the ruler; and there is the soul unchangeable as God, eternal but under the ruler. One is the master, the other the servant, and the third one is nature.\n\nGod being the cause of the projection, the continuance, and the dissolution of the universe, the cause must be present to produce the effect. Not only so, the cause becomes the effect. Glass is produced out of certain materials and certain forces used by the manufacturer. In the glass there are those forces plus the materials. The forces used have become the force of adhesion, and if that force goes the glass will fall to pieces; the materials also are undoubtedly in the glass. Only their form is changed. The cause has become the effect. Wherever you see an effect you can always analyze it into a cause, the cause manifests itself as the effect. It follows, if God is the cause of the universe, and the universe is the effect, that God has become the universe. If souls are the effect, and God the cause, God has become the souls. Each soul, therefore, is a part of God. \"As from a mass of fire an infinite number of sparks fly, even so from the Eternal One all this universe of souls has come out.\"\n\nWe have seen that there is the eternal God, and there is eternal nature. And there is also an infinite number of eternal souls. This is the first stage in religion, it is called dualism, the stage when man sees himself and God eternally separate, when God is a separate entity by Him, self and man is a separate entity by himself and nature is a separate entity by itself. This is dualism, which holds that the subject and the object are opposed to each other in everything. When man looks at nature, he is the subject and nature the object. He sees the dualism between subject and object. When he looks at God, he sees God as object and himself as the subject. They are entirely separate. This is the dualism between man and God. This is generally the first view of religion.\n\nThen comes another view which I have just shown to you. Man begins to find out that if God is the cause of the universe and the universe the effect, God Himself must have become the universe and the souls, and he is but a particle of which God is the whole. We are but little beings, sparks of that mass of fire, and the whole universe is a manifestation of God Himself. This is the next step. In Sanskrit, it is called Vishisht\u00e2dvaita. Just as I have this body and this body covers the soul, and the soul is in and through this body, so this whole universe of infinite souls and nature forms, as it were, the body of God. When the period of involution comes, the universe becomes finer and finer, yet remains the body of God. When the gross manifestation comes, then also the universe remains the body of God. Just as the human soul is the soul of the human body and minds so God is the Soul of our souls. All of you have heard this expression in every religion, \"Soul of our souls\". That is what is meant by it. He, as it were, resides in them, guides them, is the ruler of them all. In the first view, that of dualism, each one of us is an individual, eternally separate from God and nature. In the second view, we are individuals, but not separate from God. We are like little particles floating in one mass, and that mass is God. We are individuals but one in God. We are all in Him. We are all parts of Him, and therefore we are One. And yet between man and man, man and God there is a strict individuality, separate and yet not separate.\n\nThen comes a still finer question. The question is: Can infinity have parts? What is meant by parts of infinity? If you reason it out, you will find that it is impossible. Infinity cannot be divided, it always remains infinite. If it could be divided, each part would be infinite. And there cannot be two infinites. Suppose there were, one would limit the other, and both would be finite. Infinity can only be one, undivided. Thus the conclusion will be reached that the infinite is one and not many, and that one Infinite Soul is reflecting itself through thousands and thousands of mirrors, appearing as so many different souls. It is the same Infinite Soul, which is the background of the universe, that we call God. The same Infinite Soul also is the background of the human mind which we call the human soul.\"", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78632, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This is spirituality to me - I love Vivekananda's teachings.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ek7pt7/this_is_spirituality_to_me_i_love_vivekanandas/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mr_abiLLity", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_xd2tj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578196427, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ek7mtj/its_tricky_isnt_it/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ek7mtj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ek7mtj/its_tricky_isnt_it/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578216976, "score": 3, "selftext": "Growth.

every other weekend at my mom's place and I usually grocery shop for her while I'm here. So there's this guy that works at the supermarket that used to watch me and one day he came to me and said I was very beautiful. I usually feel disgusted when this happens because guys in Brazil are kind of a pain in the \\*\\*\\*. But this guy looked so sweet that I felt flattered. I used to see him almost everyday, and everyday he had this same sweet look in his eyes and it kind of intrigued me. I'm not a relationship person, I enjoy being alone and I don't get impressed a lot, but since day 1 I felt there was something.\n\nOne day I wrote my number on a piece of paper and I was going to give him. I wanted to maybe get to know him to understand why I felt like getting closer (I'm not in love with him lol), but I couldn't give him the paper because I think he left the supermarket.\n\nThis happened three or four months ago, and this week I was buying bread and wondered what happened to him, and then today there he was again with the same sweet look watching me. \n\nSooo my question is: is there some way I can understand people that are not so close to me? Studying archetypes or something like that? Or maybe understanding why specific people make me feel X or Y emotion? This happens with other people too, but this guy is the most intriguing one.

I'm not thoroughly educated on their deliefs, I do not think they're entirely right.  The spiritual practice there is appealing but at the same time why the teachings never were established.  People, you, me, just don't know shit, King's know shit.  Western Democracy and politics is fine with me.  I am not some power hungry bastard that wants to impose my own desires over us all.  The modern world is a finely developing place despite the remaining atrocities and genocides taking hold around the globe in shadow wars and proxies.   I am a flesh and blood man that experienced some esp and crossed paths with some horribly evil individuals and learned how corrupt as fuck this world is.      \n\nSome of these beings, gods, demons, are horribly corrupt and evil as fuck and are weaslin their way back into democracy and it's like taking candy from a baby for them.  The pathology and passionate lying some of these beings can do are incredibly impressive.  My integrity and claims as a Noble and Honorable gest would not get me very far.  The over whelming nature of the situation is that I was basically on my own and there's a church on every corner.    \n\nI seem to be on my own to take gallantry of the situation and slay these demons.  Instead of looking like a complete delusional psychopath I ensured cooperation with authorities and was professional, not an assassin, and generally the greatest warrior in history.  I continued to go insulted by people who I can't make you all believe what I am saying with such scant evidence.  The situation was extremely complicated as so many people were prepared to burn in hell for fucking me over.  I'l shall be there in the Lake of Fire burning with you until I am at one with the flame.  \n\nI am a reasonable and rationale person, I wanted to ensure I didn't look like a complete psychopath, just sort of a psychopath.  I've overcome most of my psychosis through personal spiritual practices and time.  The Sun God must be Zen or the planet may be obliterated in a celestial cataclysm.  \n\nI've met so many people that hate or resent the Norse Culture.  They didn't have an exact \"organized relgion\", the folklore and things weren't always entirely literal.  I mean, Valhall, may have existed but the Edda's come well ages after, it wasn't an exact religious belief.  The Great Halls were a common element of the cults the Kings and Jarls or Earls had.  These would be like giant barracks for the warriors, and places were the Kings, or The Tiwaz or the Odin's, doctors and things could aid wounded soldiers.  The King or Jarl wasn't always the Odin or Tiwaz, these were titles and surnames that came in a lineage from the origional Chieftains who may or may not be in beaurcracy at the time.  \n\nThe myth of Valhall is a wonderful fantasy, I do not know if such a realm exists anymore.  Elements of the iron age culture remain but these aesthetics are fairly different.  People were insulting me in believing in children's fantasy and comic book characters.  They seem to have hoodwinked many people in that The Gods and Angels and Demons and things are generally universal in that the cultures are all worshiping the same beings, including Jesus Christ.  I know people are quite jaded toward these things.  I am not bias, I am telling you my vision, which doesn't involve nationalism, bigotry or prejudices.  Horrific wars had been faught over cultural differences, espionage, conspiracy, and it is mortally disgusting.  \n\nI did not need a whole lot of encouragement or motives or causes for battle.  It was a hormonal need and I enjoy violence.  This day in age I'm all about morality and being a good man, a decent man, at least.  I was looking in a career of law enforcement or soldiering, things just aren't the same anymore.  These organizations are fairly corrupt and their practices make me a little consciencous.  Ideologies of honor and the values soldiers are supposed to have change over time.  Ideals of Honor were based on the cultures sense of morality, right and wrong.  Good moral accomplishments brought Honor, immoral things bring dishonor.  Some people live in a world of white noise where they have no sense of morality and only continue to impose their corrupt, broken ass desires regardless of ideals of morality.  \n\nI can be a bit macabre at times, they wanted sensitivity.  You are independent and upstanding individuals people, responsible for your own fates.  I do not know what your destiny has in store for you.  I am unable to provide facts you may desire in elements of the spirit world or a dogma.  All I have to go off of is the aether and my intuition, trusting in such things are difficult of course.  \n\n\n\nHave a good evening!\n\n\n\nEdit:  \nI meant to mention what I would do, besides slaughtering demons. I mean, these people who were supposedly these beings who have committed horrible crimes - would be prosecuted through modern judicial practices.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI was talking about pig beasts, Orcs, wearing human flesh.  Idk, the guys face came apart and like, he was a monster pig man.  These synthetic masks and suits are very convincing, I do not know if you would really notice how many people wear these.\n\nA giant Pig Man is not a beast I want to do battle with in such a weak state, I imagine this things strength and savagery is on another level.  These things seem to hate me. :(  I don't eat them.\n\nEatin people is bad and you shouldn't do it.\n\n\n\n**Add:**  \n\nOn a final note, I was trying to cooperate with all these people.  Diplomacy, relations, sensitivity.  \n\nThe ultimatums were like mass suicides, mass suicides, people dying in legions.  I understand, but, invite most of you to deep throat a 12 gauge.\n\nSo long for now, I was doing my best to humor myself and us all through this.  Organization of people get flustered.\n\n\nTaking a break again for now, I'm proof this world is coming to socialist commie Nazi ideologies.\n\nRemember the US's Constitutional rights we all enjoy. \n\n\nThe truth is out there.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78621, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Catching up with you, Pt.4.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ek5ph8/catching_up_with_you_pt4/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "HDSpiele", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_vlji2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578186338, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ek5mmr/my_awakening/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ek5mmr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ek5mmr/my_awakening/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578211429, "score": 5, "selftext": "This post is so I can search for people who had a simellar experience like me.\n\n\nWhen I was 3 years old I woke up with no memory.

Sorry for long post, but I really want to live life that I know we all deserve and can have without this anxiety , suicide thoughts ...", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78615, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Guys, I really need your advice\ud83d\ude4f", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ek43gj/guys_i_really_need_your_advice/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578177504, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ek3qhx/wtf/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ek3qhx", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ek3qhx/wtf/", "pinned": false, "removed_by_category": "deleted", "retrieved_on": 1578206383, "score": 1, "selftext": "[deleted]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78609, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Wtf", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ek3qhx/wtf/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tiinaa_", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ywklge4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578175471, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ek3af1/i_lost_my_inner_and_outter_self_how_do_i_get_it/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ek3af1", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ek3af1/i_lost_my_inner_and_outter_self_how_do_i_get_it/", "pinned": false, "removed_by_category": "moderator", "retrieved_on": 1578205226, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78603, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "I lost my inner and outter self?

I knew this was new and I still had to stay focused on getting relaxed.\n\nThen, I imagined a merkaba around my body(in third person), I imaged it spinning faster and becoming larger as more energy accumulated in my body. \n\nAfter that, I imagined (in first person) the right hand of my soul lifting out of my physical body. Then, I imagined it with my other hand and right as I was going to focus on my feet, I felt a massive amount of energy in my body.\n\nIt was like a constant vibration throughout my body, but mainly my chest area. It felt like my soul was trying to push itself out of my body. I focused on myself exiting my body. But, I sadly couldn\u2019t do it.\n\nAfter 10-15 seconds the energy faded away and my heart was racing. I tried getting focused again, but nothing happened when I tried again. So just decided to go to sleep. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m grateful I had that specific experience, because I believe I was close. I\u2019ll probably try again tonight to see if anything new happens.

He makes a lot of money because he helps a lot of people.\n\nSo in order to get what you want, you need to help people.\n\nThe bigger the problem you solve is, the bigger your paycheck.\n\n**Now let\u2019s take this idea and apply it to happiness.**\n\nMy mom is constantly happy because she gives happiness to others.\n\nShe radiates happiness, which makes other people happy, and when other people are happy she is happy.\n\nDo you see how her happiness feeds her happiness?\n\n*That\u2019s why some people are always so happy.*\n\nThey are using the law of attraction. When they are being constantly happy, they keep attracting happiness and joy into their lives.\n\nThat\u2019s why you need to start thinking about positive and happy things, in order to start attracting more happiness to your life.\n\nI created a list that contains happiness affirmations that will make you attract more happiness into your life.\n\nRepeat these happiness affirmations to raise your vibration frequency.\n\nWhen you raise your vibration frequency you will vibrate at a higher frequency and other people can feel it.\n\nYour vibration will make them feel good and happy and that will make you feel **happier.**\n\nYou will be more positive, which attracts more positivity into your life.\n\nGo here to read my list that contains 101 Happiness and Joy Affirmations:

end is a new beginning\n\nBecause in reality there is no \u201cbeginning\u201d and there is no \u201cend\u201d.\n\nThey are just words, inventions that are the result of our presumption, That evening while I was looking out the window of the bus and lost myself in the landscape that flowed in front of me, I listened to the music on my headphones, I love music and I love listening to it even more on the road, I remember \u201cStairway to heaven\u201d started, one of the most beautiful songs in the history of mankind, I had listened to it a thousand times, but that night I \u201cheard\u201d it, Not just with my ears, but with my heart and soul, For the first time I paid attention to the lyrics and the ending, when Jimmy Page\u2019s solo became an expression of the divine in each of us, I realized that I was not listening to it by chance, It was a signal from the Universe, Some of the words in that text resonated within me:\n\n\u201cAnd if you listen very carefully The melody will come to you too All is One and One is All Being a stone and not rolling.\u201d\n\nThe melody had come to me too, Led Zeppelin said it, Tiziano Terzani masterfully explained it, the most ancient religions profess it:\n\neverything is one.\n\nAnd science decrees it too:\n\nnothing is created, nothing is destroyed, everything is transformed.\n\nNo beginning, no end.\n\nThe change is cyclical, and is governed by a perfect balance: opposites are not in conflict, but in harmony with each other, We see cracks where there are none, we invent conflicts where there is only harmony, In that \u201cstone that does not roll\u201d that is the All, there are no conflicts except those that our mind invents.\n\nThat same night I discovered this Zen symbol, It\u2019s called Enso and it indicates everything I understood.\n\nThe cyclicality of life.\n\nInfinity and nothingness.\n\nThe Universe and the void.\n\nNight that becomes day that becomes night.\n\nThe black that becomes white that becomes black.\n\nThe beginning that becomes end that becomes beginning.\n\nThe interconnection and co-existence between every single element.\n\nFrom that time in Thailand, I saw this symbol everywhere: books, restaurants, temples, even tattooed on the skin of the people I met, I like to consider it a little sign of the Universe, as the right song at the right time, A signal to remind me not to find conflicts where there are none, but to abandon myself to the eternal flow of which we are all part.\n\nSo you feel at home wherever you are.\n\nSo you find peace.\n\nAll is one, And one is all",

thoughts, beliefs, emotions, sensations, imagination, desires, attachments.\n\nBecause of this, you \"see\" life through a limited perception of these believed concepts and ideas.\n\nIf you \"see\" life through these concepts and ideas, what are you actually seeing? You are seeing concepts and ideas.\n\nYou are not actually **seeing** life, you \"see\" what seems to be conditioned concepts and ideas.\n\nHow is it so that every single person can look at a car, and every single person will have a different opinion?\n\nWhich opinion is true? Whose projection is the realest? Well, the truth can't be an opinion.\n\nLife can't be a projection of the ideas and concepts you are attached to. If you would to use the basic intuitive sense of putting things together and seeing them for what they are, you would instantly recognize, that in fact, you see life through a projection of your conditioning.\n\nYou **must** recognize this and **understand** this, and not say \"ok, so what, we believe what we believe, and this is my reality!\"\n\nThis is just limiting your self and causing suffering for your self. Be honest for a moment, the egoic-mind can think whatever it wants to think but you should not take its thoughts as the truth. Because again, all these thoughts and beliefs are simply projections. You won't be able to actually **see** what I am typing right now if you were to use logic and the mind to fathom what I am saying. Wait a moment. Slow down.  \nDon't you want to be seeing clearly? Do you not want clarity, peace, joy, love, compassion to be natural?  \nIs there a reason to keep on believing we are not enough, that we need to achieve things in this life, that there is a purpose to life?  \nThe initial thoughts automatically generated by your conditioning would be: \"No, we must achieve things! We must progress! We must have evolution! We are doomed to suffer and we are destined to see life through this limited perspective.\"\n\nDo you really want to believe that though? I promise you it is not necessary to believe that. Just the fact that you are aware of these thoughts and beliefs, means there is something greater, something beyond these limiting thoughts and beliefs.\n\nLife was not destined to be seen through this limited perspective, we are not monkeys anymore, guys, please, try and see this clearly. Try and slow down for a moment and actually see with **awareness**. Not just thinking anymore. Thinking is something that the old generation of humans were doing. There is no need for that. Awareness is the higher intelligence, and that awareness is what you truly are. You are not mere thoughts that come and are perceived by you. You are the awareness it self.\n\nI know it might sound really out there, and that there is no way that all of what you thought and believed about the world is not true, but contemplate for a moment, are you really settling for the life you currently have?\n\nIs it not worth to live this life we have, extraordinarily, with clarity, with peace, with joy, with compassion, with love?\n\nYou already know these things, deep in your heart, your true being knows these things. I am not talking to what you think you are currently. I see every single one of you readers as the manifestation of joy, peace, love and compassion it self. I do not see you through the illusions of the mind. I do not see you as what you have been forced and conditioned to believe. You are way beyond that. You and I both know that this is the truth. We are limiting ourselves daily and because of these pre-conditioned beliefs we are not able to break out of it.\n\nWhat should we do about it? How do we get out of this cage? How do we live life truthfully?\n\nThe first thing is to CHOOSE to live this life. It means no matter what your mind, your thoughts, beliefs, sensations, emotions, ideas, concepts, imagination, desires and attachments says - Say \"**NO! I will not settle!\"**\n\nYou are worthy of a much greater, deeper sense of self, not just a limited thought and belief of what you are.\n\nYou are able to be the manifestation of the highest intelligence it self in this universe. The universe is not separate of you.  \nYou are not just a drop in the ocean, you are the whole ocean in a drop.\n\nAgain these things might seem out there, but this **is** what is outside of your conditioning. It is a bigger, clearer truth which is whole and complete, there is nothing to seek outside your self.\n\nYou must break all these generational conditioning that we have been carrying forever. Tell your self, seriously \"I am the last of my family name to hold this conditioning. I will break it free and will make a better life for all the next generations\"  \nDo you want your own children, grand-children to be filled with lies? Children and life it self is so pure, it is so innocent, it is so loving, peaceful, joyful and compassionate, and we are going to fill it with egoic-mind concepts?\n\nEnlightenment was also conditioned to believe it is something out of reach, something that is practically impossible, something only few individuals since the start of the universe have achieved. Question this belief!  \nYou are not other than these individuals, they simply were able to break free from their own conditioning.\n\nChrist, Krishna, Buddha and whatever enlightened person you are aware of, they all experienced life just like you. They were suffering, they had a lot of misconceptions, a lot of false knowledge and beliefs. But it is VERY possible to leave all of that behind, but you must **choose**. **Choose** **consciously** to not be better, but to embody the divinity of the universe.\n\nThe egoic-mind does not know such concepts as \"divinity\" and it will only say this is some crazy theoretical talk, but seriously! Do not believe such a limited mind, that is conditioned to think that there is no more innocence and beauty in this life!  \nBeauty and joy is not having a new smartphone, or even going out to nature, or doing different drugs, or having superficial interactions, or any other material thing you can find in the external reality.\n\nTrue beauty and joy are inside our hearts. It is our nature. It is not something to seek, it is something we are, the egoic-mind simply won't believe and accept this! Why? Because you already have set beliefs and you are not consciously letting go of them to see a greater, truthful reality. You take all the egoic-mind says, thoughts, believes and imagines to be true, without questioning anything. Is this the kind of life you want to lead? I **know you don't**.\n\nYou must see through these illusions of the egoic-mind which just wants you to stay in this cage and conditioning.\n\nWhy does it do this? Because the egoic-mind is a result of the identity you believe your self to be.  \nThis identity is insecure, anxious, greedy, judgemental, selfish. It will not let you see the truth because seeing the truth means to do or see something that might make the egoic-mind insecure, anxious. It will trigger the natural defense mechanism and will bombard you with thoughts and emotions to distract you from living a better, clearer life.\n\nYour nature is not to be insecure, to be anxious, to be greedy, to be judgemental.\n\nLook at children. Are they any of these things? No. They are conditioned, and grow up to be these things, because of the adults that forced these things on these children. Children won't know to embody love, joy, peace. It is their nature, but if their parents, something they love more than they are aware of themselves, tell them to be a certain way, it is not that they won't listen to the parents. They will stop listening to themselves. Do not let this happen.\n\nSeriously life is so, so beautiful, so precious, so joyful, so peaceful, so divine, it is just that you can't **see** it because you **think and believe it already to be something else**. If you look at something while already believing it to be a certain way, you will never see what it truly is.\n\nWhat do we do with all of this information? Start being aware. Start consuming guidances from gurus and from enlightened people, and do not just interpret it how the mind thinks it is, actually try to see it with your own perception, without distorting anything. See it innocently.\n\nAwareness is the true currency of joy, love, happiness and compassion. Awareness is all you need.\n\nLook at your hand.\n\nYou are now aware of your hand.\n\nNow be aware of being aware.\n\nIf you were to stay in this state, if you were to be aware of being aware at all times, very, very quickly **all** of your thoughts, beliefs, concepts, ideas, identity, sensations, emotions, attachments and desire will **naturally fall away.**\n\nHow does this happen? Because instead of identifying with the thoughts that appear **in** awareness, you are aware of awareness it self. With making this a habit, you are literally conditioning your self from **everything** so that only true perception is left. Only awareness is left. **From this moment, your life will be bliss it self.**", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78557, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "You are not seeing life, you are projecting life with your own thoughts and beliefs you were conditioned to believe in", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ejywfz/you_are_not_seeing_life_you_are_projecting_life/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "skatelife97", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1g6xvyhc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578154714, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ejyjwh/trusting_the_universe/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejyjwh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 21, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ejyjwh/trusting_the_universe/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578193416, "score": 7, "selftext": "As of lately I\u2019ve been having a hard time keeping trust and faith that things are going to work even though I know that they will.

We will be Starting Bhagavad-gita Verse by Verse exercise again from 13th Feb 2020.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThis verse is a reply to Arjuna's third question: What is the means of attaining to the transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature. One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a activities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a activities are known asbhakti-yoga-always acting for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This includes not only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but His different plenary expansions such as R\u0101ma and N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. He has innumerable expansions. One who is engaged in the service of any of the forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be transcendentally situated. One should also note that all the forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal. Such personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all transcendental qualities. So, if one engages himself in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, he can overcome them easily. This is already explained in the Seventh Chapter. One who surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature. To be in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire the equality of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine. Thus the living entity's spiritual position is as good as gold, as good as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in quality. The difference of individuality continues, otherwise there is no question of bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there and the activity of exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there. Therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there is no meaning to bhakti-yoga. If one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the qualification is to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination. It is said in the Vedic literature:brahmaiva san brahm\u0101pyeti. One can attatin the Supreme Brahman by becoming Brahman. This means that one must qualitatively become one with Brahman. By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his eternal Brahman identity as individual soul.\n\n**Question 1 : How can one overcome the modes of material nature ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/ejtnkd/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1426/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78503, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 14.26", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ejtnpt/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1426/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bekindbehappy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3dh9zv3e", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578123343, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ejtmxr/what_exactly_is_nonself_and_how_do_i_live_with_it/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejtmxr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ejtmxr/what_exactly_is_nonself_and_how_do_i_live_with_it/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "FQOutv9lDOnQCF3wcGS_1C-RVMb9fIs6Kdj40OGUYlA", "resolutions": [{"height": 74, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZdkLPpZgil9bCqVPc1V6LgGc1J_20anZusqphsZO7g4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1977807d610055a715ce0644dc8c50104179835", "width": 108}, {"height": 148, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZdkLPpZgil9bCqVPc1V6LgGc1J_20anZusqphsZO7g4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53e3e56b0c68264e1274f24c3ee73e6eba3059a1", "width": 216}, {"height": 219, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZdkLPpZgil9bCqVPc1V6LgGc1J_20anZusqphsZO7g4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76dc23a35771a4e496fca77fb5defb05d3ce3733", "width": 320}, {"height": 439, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZdkLPpZgil9bCqVPc1V6LgGc1J_20anZusqphsZO7g4.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90cf0c98a2a82ba1e58ff8190c197087715327a5", "width": 640}, {"height": 659, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZdkLPpZgil9bCqVPc1V6LgGc1J_20anZusqphsZO7g4.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c278fea068432d97bf781f485477d0a487c85e5", "width": 960}, {"height": 741, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZdkLPpZgil9bCqVPc1V6LgGc1J_20anZusqphsZO7g4.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96712061a941ae6c60696b4309f51390362c008b", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 824, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/ZdkLPpZgil9bCqVPc1V6LgGc1J_20anZusqphsZO7g4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=2381e14e2bfe517116da74ffec2437e87a5fcb91", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1578176582, "score": 1, "selftext": "**What is Non Self?**\n\nThe theory of Non-Self explains that within our own unique human experience, there is, in fact, no permanent, underlying entity we can truly identify as Me or I. This idea is easier to grasp once we have understood the nature of cause and effect and impermanence. When we perceive all phenomena as conditioned, we realize that everything is the way it is because of something else. Concerning our body and mind, we can break it down at every level to penetrate this truth.\n\nMentally, what we label as I and Me, are a combination of concepts, memories, thoughts, and ideas that are conditioned by our past experiences, feelings, emotions, sensations, and perceptions. Because they are conditioned, they are susceptible to change. What makes You and Me depends on a big part, our upbringing, education, social environment, family values, national cultures, and many more factors. As our environment changes throughout our lives, we open up to different cultures, different social groups, and different hobbies and past times; we are inevitably shaped by them into something slightly or drastically different. If we reflect on our past, can we really say we are the same person? Maybe some aspects have remained unchanged, but change is a natural part of growth and development. Without change, growth would not be possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhole article here: [https://bekindbehappy.net/2020/01/04/what-exactly-is-non-self-and-how-do-i-live-it/](https://bekindbehappy.net/2020/01/04/what-exactly-is-non-self-and-how-do-i-live-it/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78502, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What exactly is Non-Self and how do I live with it?

Saved myself so much stress and heartache instead of forgiving and holding hope that she would start being nice too.\nI don\u2019t see how I could bring myself to ask a friend to leave though. \n\nWhat would you have done in a situation like this?\nAt what point do you need to draw a line between the love for others and self love?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78479, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "At what point do you need to draw a line between the love for others end and self love?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ejrwvp/at_what_point_do_you_need_to_draw_a_line_between/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lovehaswon777", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_xnyab", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578113190, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ejrvtw/the_clarity_of_love/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejrvtw", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ejrvtw/the_clarity_of_love/", "pinned": false, "removed_by_category": "reddit", "retrieved_on": 1578169860, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78479, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "The Clarity of Love", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ejrvtw/the_clarity_of_love/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "singularitycommunion", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5d6flfdv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578112863, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ejrtgd/is_spirit_a_living_planetary_singularity/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejrtgd", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ejrtgd/is_spirit_a_living_planetary_singularity/", "pinned": false, "removed_by_category": "reddit", "retrieved_on": 1578169620, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78479, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Is spirit a living planetary singularity?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ejrtgd/is_spirit_a_living_planetary_singularity/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "fetgsrffgttfvdssrfs", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4wd3yjxi", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578112501, "domain": "self.spirituality", "edited": 1578112835, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ejrqsx/am_i_other_thinking/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejrqsx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ejrqsx/am_i_other_thinking/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578169336, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi there.

We remember it, although perhaps only foggily. The world around us touched us so deeply; a simple thing would take us to the edge of tears. For a while we felt no shame, only the bliss of being our selves. The difference came when we began to look to others. Grownups rarely cried, and people our age who cried were guided out of sight and came back tearless. We couldn't be sure why, but we became aware that the part of us which felt deeply was a secret, to be hidden from others. \n\nSo we went about the world, met with dry and stern faces. They showed disdain, and even laughter, but they never displayed a sense of tenderness. We sensed that the way to be in the world was to harden our exterior, pushing down anything soft so deep that no one could find it. That way we'd never stand out, never make a fool of our selves. \n\nOur feelings never left us, but we attempted to ignore them. They bubbled under the surface, occasionally causing a crack in the exterior and spilling through. The embarrassment we experienced at our revolting interior caused us to hate the part of us that felt so deeply; it proved that our hardness was only an act, we were actually much weaker than we let on. \n\nWe bought into the collective lie that emotions are our weakness. We attempted to destroy a part of our selves as a result. Why, then, did we never succeed? It wasn't for a lack of trying. Our soft part persisted, mocking us when we sat alone. When we were alone the weight of the act we put on was too much, and we collapsed into overwhelming feeling. This act of opening was so scary that we began to lock our soft spot off even to our selves. Not only were these feelings unfortunate, they seemed downright dangerous. It went on like this for a long time.\n\nNow, with the extra perspective of age we put our attention on those around us. Do they really seem to know the answer? Do any of them walk lightly, free from an apparent burden? No, they live strict, scared lives, terrified to let on that they don't understand what's happening. Everyone believes that if they go with the crowd they'll never be called out for being clueless. Is this the fear we want to live in? It becomes incredibly obvious that they have no right to tell us how we are meant to live. \n\nOnce we become aware enough to understand that others know no better, we can gain the courage to trust in our selves. But, there's an issue: we've already locked away the part of us which we now wish to explore. The solution won't be as simple as finding a key, since we've had to repeatedly fortify this wall against our own attempts to get through it. Our ability to touch and be touched by the events around us feels inaccessible, as though we are behind a piece of glass watching the world outside of our bodies. \n\nWe attempt to weaponize those feelings which we kept for protection from the world. We aim our anger, shame and resentment at our walls, hoping we can force them to collapse. Like a wild animal, our gentle emotions only retract further into their hiding spots as a result. It is much like trying to hold a slippery substance, where the moment we make a fist it escapes our grasp. \n\nThen, we give up. Apparently we have finally achieved our past goal of destroying any softness in our selves. We go about life, aware that we are missing out on something but too dejected to explore any deeper. Eventually other issues take up our interest, and we move on from this pursuit. \n\nWhat we don't realize is that our walls need to be constantly maintained in order to stay up. We've given up on keeping them tall and strong, so they've been falling apart inside of us. Something happens in our lives; it may be the beauty of meeting a lover, or the terror of losing a family member. Our walls and our self-deceits are far too weak to resist the opening which occurs. The overwhelming sense of existence floods our being, not coming from outside us but from within. We collapse like a baby, showered in this nearly unbearable light. It is so strong that it is terrifying, yet we surrender to it, feeling a limitless freedom. From that moment on, we never attempt to control what touches us. We let it enter us from inside, we learn to embrace ourselves and our experience tenderly like a loving mother. \n\nThis is what it means to be human; we have been resisting it for far too long. Strength has never been an act of force, it has been an act of daring. We find our way to bliss by daring to love ourselves, to experience our world without fear, to understand each other in the same way we hope to be understood.

I hope it doesn't get infected and fall off, it's quite a canker.  The Goddesses and things, I do not know if the pantheons are even true.  Like God has no children.  He does, but they are far more reclusive and decent folk than these sicko fucks.  The witches, succubus, and all.  She's always raging, I'm an arrogant prick, she's waiting to dominate me.  Hmph...  There are women to be frightened of out there, I will destroy this woman's mind in time.  I do not understand her misplaced complex with me or any of these people I had mentioned in the past.  For a recap, potential deities, it's hard to talk about.  They've been patient, polite at times, while some continue to harass or torment me.  It's this moronic nature that occurs where things are perpetually made worse and worse out of spite, jealousy or ignorance and it is typically not my fault.  Regardless of whether or not this deity is literally a mentally ill fucking moron this symbiotic nature between them continue with the parasitic one continuing their work. \n\n\nI don't understand their complex toward me, I was a soldier, I would more than likely never even be a threat to them or know they existed.. It's bizarre, morbid, their odd satisfaction in tormenting me.  I have gone cold steel and can not break myself of this madness.  Thousands of years of these idiotic parasitic fucking beings and I seem to be the lone soul causing all of this pain while the lot of these bastard creatures have some symbiotic and parasitic clutch on each other, while other people do not want to get involved.  You want something done, you have to do it yourself.  I can only reflect on others, these beings are ill, it's been said.  People, bigotry had held us back.   Monotheism is partly true, but, these representations do not seem accurate.  It is a modern age, I should not be crucified, burned at the stake or otherwise executed amid another episode of my nightmare of an existence for the last several thousand years.\n\nSome organizations of Pagans were working on reconstructions and cultural folk lore and myths.  Some of these beings I can not directly identify do to upg, are heinous and disgraceful, evil as fuck.  Some people know this and continue to worship them, like the \"Satanic\" cults...  \"Satan\" seems to be several different people, I do not know.  One or two seem like legit individuals, others are evil as fuck.   I can't break out the Old Testament, nor am I a scholar on religion, nor do I care about your dogma.  It's all a conglomerate abomination on the Earth.  I am supposedly a Lord, the Lord, God, while there are other chieftain Gods.  And the cast out, \"Arch Demon Gods\", are trying to use some counter intuitive reverse psychology. It's in testament that they are emancipating themselves from persecution and piety in a society that would except them, they are persuasive, a lot of people love their rotten ass corruption, I am not able to persuade you all with my integrity, and honesty, while they can pathologically just fuck me all over the place.\n\nI am a regular man, I smoke, drink, fuck whores, don't give a fuck.  My person, ego, genetics, had been insulted.  I am a decent person amid your views of ethics and morality, I am generally quite a pure person.  It's a modern age, I have a big brain, thinking, intelligent, not subordinate.  We still live in a world with slave ideologies, conspiracy, lies, corruption.  \n\n\n\nJust waiting for a bullet in the head.\n\nOh, Lord of the Rings, J.R.R. Tolkien.  I was talking about Orcs, it puzzled people.  Idk, there is only scant myth of these beings...  My vision they wear human skins, or are also shape-shifters.  This mother fuckers face came lose and all I saw was a bunch of fucked up teeth and I immediately had the impression he was an Ork/Ogre/Troll, basically a down caste of \"Demons\"  Like the Angels/Demons have various castes.  The \"Orks\" weren't really related to Elf, closer to a down caste of Man.  I was talking about slaughtering men like pigs and then chivalry.  I'm not trying to promote prejudice again Alien, Man or beast.\n\n\"If it squeals, it's Orc, because they're like Pork, taste and smell like shit though.\"  Fucking weird pig beast.  Idk if they're real, they're like, evil as fuck, and cannibals.\n\nI'm not really into fantasy, I do enjoy scifi, Mass Effect, Star Wars.  People wanted to know what I do, I'm just a regular guy.  The past was more of an actual nightmare than a fantasy to me, full of heinous wars and atrocities onto Man and God, I prefer to look to the future.\n\n\nIt's all about cultural perspective, folk lore, mis-translations.  What you call one thing in your culture, is different in another.  Then nationalists, bigotry, animosity.  \n\n\nI can't say any of myth or religion is exactly true.  Folklore/ myth shouldn't have been entirely literally taken exactly seriously by sensible folk.  I do not sympathies with the ages exactly.  Like all these bleeding hearts with slavery and the caste system.  People, Humanity, throughout the ages, up until my last experience today, are/were totally fucking savage beasts.  Dealing with a human being in the tribal age, involved iron and shackles, bludgeoning or death until it was an more orderly creature.\n\n\n\n\nCheers\n\n\n**Edit:**  \n\nSearch up \"Pig squeals\" for reference.  \n\n**Edit:**  \n\nI was talking of gnosis for a time, it was a joke as well.  I mean, I referenced to just knowing shit defying logic.  Much of the universe we try and team into our adapting brain is far beyond logic, like most of it.  You see it, it's just an image and theoretical numbers and crunching for you to think you understand.  As we are spoon fed knowledge of the comsos and dimension, existence and life, I am glad to live in such a privileged age in the west.  I know religious and spiritual talk is hard in a world full of great macabre humor.  I lose candor at times, I'm not a sick fuck.  People dying in masses  just doesn't get my goat.  ( I do not believe people should be punished!  BUT YOU MAY BE PUNISHED!)\n\nI was talking about slavery and being punk ass white boy.  Like, I don't know what it's like for (REDACTED) ethnicity.  Well, I was in the U.S. Military, full of 3rd world soldiers and slave driver mother fuckers.  They don't want our own silver spoon kids getting slaughtered in battle.  They want 3rd World child soldiers, programmed, ready to kill at order, straight from the Savannah.  I'm not dishonoring those fine products, it's just fucked up.  \nThe racism I have experienced had just made me sick to my stomach.  I'm not encouraging supremacy or racism,   these double standards are aggravating.  You can take a well nurtured child or an abused child and turn them into psychopaths, the results may vary.  Performance, however, based on genetics, diet and nutrition.  \n\nI went on about my performance in battle, it was adequate, I was ready to rock, just not physically at a level I would respect now.  I'm just older and wiser now, not a naive punk ass white boy now.  I ain't got no chip on my shoulder, unless you're the chip on my shoulder.  Bullying, insults, sexual assault, damn near raped in the ass by some psychotic infantrymen, I been there.  I was a radio guy, a \"pog (person other than grunt).\"  Didn't make it to the raid, it fucks me up.  I was a noble gate guard, I did mostly security details, which was dishonored, which dishonoring the guard is a horrible dishonor, if I remember correctly.  The carnage was limited to mortar volley's and some small arms fire, a frat, a few rapes, and down times.  Nothing was documented properly, I got back, shut the fuck up.  Basically these mother fuckers I'm waiting on killing themselves or me if shit gets harry, and a bunch of other sicko fucks.  The tour was legit as far as I know, shit haunts me, kids, women.  Chivalry, I for some reason expected it, it was quite barbaric out there.  \n\nI'm not trying to be \"egotistic\" or delusional, I was as skeptical as we all.  Believe what you want, why would I give a fuck?  I mean, people over the ages dedicated their lives or were just sicko fucks lying about the truth.  I do not dishonor those that dedicated their lives trying to learn the truth.  Do not take what I say personally, I am just playing along in the shit.\n\nI hearken to the Iron Age, Sparta, Rome, The Norse, all of it.  It was basically slavery then, it wasn't about you, your ego.  It was about the organization, Crown, Nation, **Mission**.  We all have our ego's, you are recognized by acts or valor or just fucked up shit like the wrong person given valor who didn't do shit.  Officers run things, Noble's, Bureaucrats, it's not about you as a pawn.  So after you get out, if you get out, all of that freedom collapses on you, and it's about you again.  \n\nGod Bless the modern age, technology, freedom, independence, liberty.  These are things I always believe in this life, the last or next.  Things aren't easy for me, I am flesh and bone and blood, full of rice grain and rage.  I quell myself through stoic or tao practices.  I am not a religious or power desiring person.  \n\nI wasn't born in a Castle, doctored into power and bureaucracy as a Noble would be.  I went on to talk about the nobility being assassinated or caste out.  But, I am not self important, I am just playing along.  I can not verify much with little to no support.\n\nI am not the same person I was in the Iron age.  I am coping with these ideals of humanity and morality.  I am just not a ruthless killing machine anymore.  God dammit, it hard to commit.\n\nI was talking about slaughtering men like pigs, then chivalry.\n\nI thank the Lord I walk the Earth any given time.  It's not Kosher in the mind.\n\nI do not know why I would be reborn as a babe.  I imagine the Lord could re-incarnate me at any stage, genetic code or age, it's brutal.\n\nUppsala, please, well bred, gold hair, wealthy, rich.\n\n\nAh, my desires... Wealth, riches, properties?  I desired none of these things.  I'm a loser.  I just desired to sate my need for battle in the Krieg Spiel.  \n\n\n\n\n**Edit:**  \n\nAh, people getting flustered.  These \"Gods/Demons\", as far as I can tell may have mortal bodies and astral project.  Not everyone can do this..  It's part of the problem, I can not astral project - like in the cartoons.  I am bound to my body through space magic.  \n\nYou may be able to find these dirty creatures and slaughter them, I'm trying to avoid such a fate.\n\nThat's the best I can do for ya.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78426, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Catching up with you, Pt.2.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ejnjta/catching_up_with_you_pt2/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "peanubutterpickles", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3fxb0sqe", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578089679, "domain": "self.spirituality", "edited": 1578092825, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ejmq71/bells_ringing/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejmq71", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 19, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ejmq71/bells_ringing/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578150330, "score": 1, "selftext": "I've been having trouble sleeping the past few nights.

But all I'm doing is panicking about the future which I know logically is futile and I'm making myself depressed and missing out on the present moment. \n\nI've been reading a book by Anthony De Mello called Awareness and it's mind blowing and so simple. He outlines that we are just a bunch of conditioned thoughts and beliefs. He also made me aware that I'm not my thoughts I'm the observer. It's like say if my dad left me when I was a child and I didn't know about his heart problems. I wouldnt be anxious then and it's not the heart problem thats making me anxious and worry but my thoughts about it. \n\nIn a way it's good that I'm aware of the possibility of future problems as i can look after my health and exercise but apart from that there's not much I can do apart from regular check ups. \n\nHow can I just observe these worrying thoughts and not identify with them? This is basically running and ruling my life at the moment. I mean yeah something dreadful could happen tomorrow but no amount of me worrying and trying to control what happens is actually going to stop that thing happening. Maybe nothing happens with my heart and I worry for the next 30 years which I don't want to do cause it's robbing me of the present. \n\nWhy do our minds do this?

I didn't tell my boss or anyone until I booked my flight, so when I told him the days he told me it works out because he was going to tell me that's when he wouldn't have much work for us to do and I would be coming back just in time for us to pick back up. When I told my family they were very against me going, I was at a Christmas party and they all were saying how dangerous it was and asking me if I will return and saying how I will be sold into human trafficking down there or get killed. They didn't have anything good to say like a \"How exciting!\" or \"I'm happy for you!\".\n\nAs the New Year's came by I got a call from my sister that one of our cousins suddenly passed away and the next day my car's wheel cylinders busted while driving so my brakes wouldn't work, luckily it happened next to my house so I didn't get in a wreck or anything, but it will set me back some money. Now I am wondering if I should still travel to Thailand which is approaching soon.

my health.\n\n**Let me tell you my story\u2026**\n\nEight years ago I lost **44 pounds in six months\u2026** \n\nDo you want to know how I did it?\n\nI started using affirmations to motivate myself\u2026 After I started using affirmations, **my results skyrocketed**.\n\nWhen I was trying to lose weight without manifesting with affirmations, I would always lose 4 pounds but gained 10 pounds after that.\n\nI never really had the courage and the motivation to keep going on.\n\n**Everything changed when I started using affirmations!**\n\nAffirmations gave me an incredible amount of energy and motivation to keep improving my health.\n\n&gt;I tell my story in the hope that it will give you motivation and strength to believe in the law of attraction.\n\nEverything starts with a thought and belief.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe in the law of attraction then it doesn\u2019t work for you.\n\n**We become what we think about.**\n\nIf your life is not what you imagined it to be then you are thinking and manifesting the wrong things.\n\nYou see, you create your life with your thoughts.\n\nIf your thinking pattern is toxic and you keep feeding negative things to your mind, then you will attract only negative things into your life.\n\nThe awesome thing about the law of attraction is that it works both ways.\n\nIf you change your thinking pattern and you start to think about positive things, then you will start to attract positive things into your life.\n\nTo improve your health you have to change your thinking pattern to support a healthy lifestyle.\n\nThe easiest way to change your thinking pattern is to start bounding health affirmations to your subconscious mind until the affirmations become part of you.\n\nWhen the health affirmations become part of you, you will start to make healthier choices throughout the day because your thinking patterns have changed.\n\nNow your mind remembers affirmations like *\u201cI love to drink water to nourish my body.\u201d*\u00a0so every time you think about getting a soda you will remember that \u201cOH! I really need to improve my health, I think I drink water instead.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that changing your thinking pattern and improving your health won\u2019t happen overnight.\n\nIt will take time but it\u2019s better to grow slow and steady if you want a solid foundation.\n\nChanging your thinking pattern will change your whole life and change it for good.\n\nImproving your health will become your lifestyle.\n\n**You will enjoy better health for the rest of your life.**\n\n&gt;The law of attraction is real and health affirmations work. I know it because I have used health affirmations to improve my health, you can do it too!\n\nIf you are ready to improve your health, go check out my Life-Changing Health Affirmations blog post here:  [https://perfectaffirmations.com/**health-affirmations**/](https://perfectaffirmations.com/health-affirmations/) \n\nSmiles &amp; Hugs, -Kalle", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78388, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "LIFE-CHANGING Health Affirmations That WORK!", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ejelsi/lifechanging_health_affirmations_that_work/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "japaneseblue", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_fzfzh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578046930, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ejdlxe/i_think_i_had_my_first_lucid_dream_and_also_ive/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejdlxe", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Self-Promoting"}], "link_flair_template_id": "e4fe724c-8418-11e7-8ef1-0ee29c473ac4", "link_flair_text": "Self-Promoting", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ejdlxe/i_think_i_had_my_first_lucid_dream_and_also_ive/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578120498, "score": 0, "selftext": "There were 2 black men, one was offering to suck my dick and the other to eat my ass, I was stuck between being asleep and in my body.

The living entities are combinations of the material nature and the spiritual nature. Such living entities are seen not only on this planet, but in every planet, even in the highest where Brahm\u0101 is situated. Everywhere there are living entities; within the earth there are living entities, even within water and within fire. All these appearances are due to the mother, material nature, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's seed-giving process. The purport is that the living entities, being impregnated in the material world, come out and form at the time of creation according to their past deeds.\n\n**Question 1 : How a living entity is born and what is the cause of the form he gets ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/ejc5s6/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_144/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78354, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 14.4", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ejc62r/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_144/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "awarders": [], "banned_by": "moderators", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578036797, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ejc5sh/i_found_you_know_who_you_are_then_you_also_know/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejc5sh", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ejc5sh/i_found_you_know_who_you_are_then_you_also_know/", "pinned": false, "removed_by_category": "deleted", "retrieved_on": 1578113669, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78354, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "I found you know who \u2018You\u2019 are, then you also know who \u2018We\u2019 are.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ejc5sh/i_found_you_know_who_you_are_then_you_also_know/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "avocadoo89", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3etw97r0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578033509, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ejbmi2/what_do_you_do_to_prevent_your_ego_from_gaining/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejbmi2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 44, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ejbmi2/what_do_you_do_to_prevent_your_ego_from_gaining/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578111220, "score": 2, "selftext": "It can be difficult to stay centered when facing situations that strongly threatens your ego's beliefs and for many times that makes me regret the way i react to these situations.

I haven't been able to realize this for years until just now, that how much importance we give to someone dictates how much their words and actions impact us. For example, if someone you consider to be really important says something good about you, it will make you feel alot better about yourself than say if someone who you'd consider to be not important said the same thing. It also works the same way if that person said something bad about you, you might end up feeling bad for weeks afterwards where as it might not affect you at all if the other person said it.\n\nMy point is that all of this is simply illusion, the importance we give someone or something is created solely within the mind. It doesn't really matter who says what, it's only our minds that make out certain things to be bigger than others.\nThe mind is always looking for validation from external sources mainly being other people, so if you're trapped in your mind your sense of worth will always be at the mercy of external circumstances. Next time someone says something that hurts you, ask yourself why am I giving this person so much importance. What is it about them that makes me see them this way.

1578095306, "score": 7, "selftext": "Judgment has multiple meanings in our society. The most comprehensive definition I can think of is the cognitive process of reaching a decision or drawing conclusions on a person, situation, or event. It is typically an opinion that people form that may or may not be grounded in objectivity and/or facts. As humans we all form judgments and opinions that are based on our personal experiences, beliefs, feelings and emotions. However, we must remember that no matter how true these judgments may feel to us, they are simply our own opinions.\n\nShame also has multiple meanings in our society. Like all other human emotions, it has no boundaries as it is an emotion that is experienced universally across all social classes and cultures. It has been defined comprehensively multiple times. It is a powerful, provocative and overwhelming emotion to experience. When it comes to defining this emotion, most would agree that it is a painful feeling of humiliation or distress that is associated with creating a negative evaluation of the self. It\u2019s the feeling of being incompetent, unworthy, or feeling like you are a disgrace.\n\nWhen it comes to human relations, we must remember that perception influences our daily lives in every way possible. Perception is an unconscious process that occurs when we take in information from our world and use that information to form our own reality. Human perception is influenced by multiple factors that make up the unique equation of who we are and the reality that we form for ourselves.\n\nSome of the things that influence our perception include our past experiences, and the assumptions and expectations we have of ourselves and others. Each of us has a unique set of character traits, that are influenced by biology, our environment and upbringing, and our education. Each of us develops our own self-concept which is influenced by our culture, faith, values, preconceived notions, and our present circumstances.\n\nIt always amazes me that even though we are all unique and face our own unique challenges and struggles that as a society we continue to pass judgment on others. I can\u2019t say that I am perfect or have all the answers because that would be foolish of me to say. But I do know that as the human race we must seek to understand each other before jumping to conclusions and shaming others. As a clinician, and more importantly as a human being I have seen the damaging effects that judgment and shaming can have on the lives of people. I have worked with countless individuals who have been shamed and humiliated and the damage can take years to correct. In some cases, it leads people to contemplate or commit suicide.\n\nAs a society we must collectively work together to help heal the people that have been paralyzed with the traumatic consequences of judgment, shame, and all the other ills that afflict humanity. We must practice forgiving ourselves and forgiving others and freeing ourselves from holding on to pain. The reality is that we may never get that apology from the people who have wronged us, and we have to learn to let things be. We can\u2019t control anyone\u2019s behavior or decisions. We can only control how we choose to proceed, and what decisions we wish to make. We must help each other find peace and we must consciously choose love and compassion instead of judgment and shame.\n\nWe must all look inward, and free ourselves by seeking the truth and listening to our heart.\n\nRemember to always live for yourself and don't worry about what others think or say about you. It's none of your business anyway.\n\nWe must stop judging others for their mistakes or the way they live their life just because it\u2019s different from ours. We are all unique and we must understand that not everyone will live according to our personal values. We are all a unique equation that shapes how we live our life. Although it\u2019s easier said than done we must find the courage to remove ourselves from people or situations that are toxic. Stay true to yourself and let those people who have wronged you or caused you pain begin their own journey of self-healing.\n\nRemember that before you form an opinion or judge someone you must understand that there are things that we all have faced that make us who we are. Everyone has a struggle it\u2019s part of life, everyone is simply trying to live and survive. We never really know the pain and struggles that people are facing unless we ask instead of making assumptions and passing judgment.\n\nAs a society we tend to quickly judge people who we perceive as different, but the reality is that we all share in the human experience. We are all equal. The universe, the truth, it\u2019s all within us. We have within us the ability to heal. We must consciously choose love and compassion over hate and shame. Always seek to understand first before making judgments.  \n\nIf you have wronged others seek to change, seek forgiveness, seek treatment, seek help. Heal yourself and let the people you hurt heal in peace, let them live their life. Move on and live your life, heal yourself too. Let the past die, choose to live your life in the moment.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78286, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Rise Above Judgement and Shame", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ej7pni/rise_above_judgement_and_shame/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lovehaswon777", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_xnyab", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578013742, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ej7o5a/daily_astrologyjanuary_2nd_2020_action_and/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ej7o5a", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ej7o5a/daily_astrologyjanuary_2nd_2020_action_and/", "pinned": false, "removed_by_category": "reddit", "retrieved_on": 1578095144, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 78282, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Daily Astrology~January 2nd, 2020: Action and Resistance", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ej7o5a/daily_astrologyjanuary_2nd_2020_action_and/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "butterface2019", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_433dzpj6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578013015, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ej7iij/do_you_guys_always_live_truly_in_the_present/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ej7iij", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Enlightenment"}], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 16, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ej7iij/do_you_guys_always_live_truly_in_the_present/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578094544, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve been learning more and more about the ego and the effects it has on our lives.

Is this true?\n\nMy friend has been through a lot of trauma starting from around age 9 to age 16. The trauma has also made her really wise when it comes to things that involve life in general. She has demons/voices in her head. They come around anytime she feels pain/hurt and it triggers her into having an extreme version of a panic attack in which she passes out afterwards. It\u2019s like the good and bad are fighting inside her head and the bad(negativity) usually wins. \n\nShe knows what she needs to do to heal, and I also tell her affirming what she already knows. She believes that she is just the way she is forever, that she just has to suppress the demons. \nI\u2019ve been on a healing journey, I don\u2019t have anywhere NEAR the amount of healing she has to do, I don\u2019t have any severe traumas, it\u2019s me just learning how to love myself and not let others take advantage of me. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking that she\u2019s wrong about the fact that she\u2019s stuck like that, but could she be right? In my head I\u2019ve told myself that she\u2019s just stuck in a negative mindset and she\u2019s just not ready/strong enough to leave it? Or she\u2019s just simply not being ready to heal because of something. \nFor people with an immense amount of trauma is it better to try and push it down, rather than heal, and try to make it go away? \n\nI\u2019ve never been through pain like that so I really don\u2019t know. We used to date and the fact that I was healing and she wasn\u2019t brought up problems, it felt like I was trying to drag her along my side while I grew. I understand that she has to grow on her own, but I used to think I could help her get there, but I\u2019m starting to feel discouraged. We EXUDE soulmate energy, our connection is beyond any other romantic or platonic friendship I\u2019ve ever been in and it really does feel like I\u2019m in her life to possibly aid/support her healing. I\u2019m an Empath and a cancer and it doesn\u2019t feel good when I can\u2019t help someone LOL, but I\u2019m willing to accept if I can\u2019t. \n\nI want to believe that even people who have been through SO much can heal. I feel like there\u2019s even a few celebrity examples! But the majority of people with trauma struggle their entire lives. I don\u2019t want that to be her.\n\nAny thoughts, answers, or advice would help!

The idea I'm attempting to explain is from many cultures around the world. These ideas are brought on by self-reflection and meditation. The word \"sunyata\" in Sanskrit means emptiness or voidness. Which, it is either an ontological feature of reality, a meditative state, or a phenomenological analysis of experience. There is another term called \"Maya\" which means \"deceit\". Mayans and Buddhists claim that the world is Maya or an illusion. \n\nI believe that during intense meditative states, one is able to achieve a higher state of consciousness. During these higher states of self-awareness, the mind is able to perceive a higher order of thoughts.

an employee because so much times i feel he's not respecting me.

So i must be at the right place with that employee and i need to understand what this person is getting our of my inner-self. And i have just realised it today. It's something that followed me since school (cause kids are cruel,  we all get bullied at some point in our childhood) and is that when someone is telling something about me that is not necessarily kind, most of the time it's a joke, not intentionally hateful, and i react pretty badly inside, i get very emotional and upset. \n\nIt's my ego! I realised i'm at that place with that person because i reach that point in my life that to go on further in my spiritual and mental development, i need to free myself from the ego.\n\nWhatever people says, it's just words. What i am inside is what i am and it will always be. Freeing myself from ego is the only way to be free from getting harm by words, the only way to accept me as i am, to believe in what i am, to be STRONG inside, really, for the first time in my life.\n\nHave any of you know what i'm talking about? Any of you went through it? Any advice or experience to share?\n\nHope we can all make a leap together if you are concern, and free ourselves from the illusion of ego!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports":

I have been feeling very well ever since the shift to 2020 and also whilst meditating feel very whole and conscious etc. But I can't wrap my head around this.. am I somehow charged and is it interfering with it, am I conducting electricity? Or is it the electromagnetic field thats somehow influencing me? It's not necessarily a painful sensation but sometimes theres a little surge of pain, and definitely after longer exposure it starts to hurt. I also read or overheard one time that having your laptop on your \"lap\" could lead to infertility in the long run or something. So maybe it's related to this and I'm just gaining awareness of it?\n\nI'm currently studying IT so this would definitely affect my career in a way.

Just today, I watched a video on letting go. The person it said that in order for things to fall into place, you need to let go in order to shed resistance (not exactly how she said it, but that's the idea).\n\nShe had also explained that you need to feel happy and grateful now and not be in a state of lack. Would this be considered vibrational work rather than just trusting the universe alone??\n\nShe bassically says that you need to let go and stop trying so hard to manifest your desire and go with the flow of life. If you let go of resistance things will come to you, but you also have to do that vibrational work?

After the destruction of the body, both the soul and the Supersoul exist, and they go on eternally in many various moving and unmoving forms. The Sanskrit word parame\u015bvaram is sometimes translated as the individual soul because the soul is the master of the body, and after the destruction of the body he transfers to another form. In that way he is master. But there are others who interpret this parame\u015bvaram to be the Supersoul. In either case, both the Supersoul and the individual soul continue. They are not destroyed.

I was doing a meditation on meeting my inner child. It was about imagining you are a leaf that breaks off of a beautiful tree and you are taken by the wind. You end up falling into this stream and you travel a little bit until you come to rest in a clear pond. You begin to see these little bubbles come up above your leaf and as you look closer you notice that they are memories of you youth. There is one that sticks out to you and when the guide counts you down 5 to 1 you are witnessing the event as your current self. You ask your younger self how they are feeling. I began to tear up. I feel more that see or hear so I felt her (my inner child) feelings of lack of control, fear and at the mercy of a maniac. I feel differently now because I understand what my dad was doing although he was overboard in how he did it but knowing that doesn't take away from the experience my inner child experienced. So I begin to feel my inner child apologize to my current self for making me grow up and turn into the messed up person I am now. The adult with all of the issues and baggage...she's apologizing for that. I felt offended...I told my inner child that it was not her fault and she was a little girl and no one protected her that day and that who I ended up becoming had nothing to do with how she handled anything. I created a loving bond with her and then adult me began to feel guilty that I am not honoring my child self's experiences by continuing to allow people to hurt her. I am a grown woman and should demand respect for that little girl so she can begin to trust me and feel safe. Funny thing is that I felt emotions from both that have changed me forever. I look at that damaged little girl and say to myself, \"Athena, you have a solemn duty to protect that girl from pain.

I chalked up the ease of doing so, to be something related to, or along the lines of epigenetics. Outside persuasions from childhood. The \u201cvictim\u2019s\u201d parents and grandparents had also fallen under this programming, therefore it\u2019s easy for someone to say they see nothing abnormal going on, when abnormal is their normal perception of reality. It\u2019s ingrained, this isn\u2019t something new.\n\n The programming is self sufficient. What your grandfather was taught as a boy, influenced him into manhood. When he had your father or mother, his accumulation of experiences helped shape his model for parenting. For he is a product of experience, and knows no different than his own subjecting journey. We project what we know. \u201cGood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d. And so on down the line the cycle continues. It will continue until that cycle is broken, or those negative constructs, beliefs and actions are made aware of. Until awareness of them exists, they will continue to bleed into generations. Once you\u2019re aware of them, you can begin to analyze them. You can\u2019t always find the causation, but you can find methods of coping, and in some circumstances you can learn how to end that cycle entirely. \n\n\nThe reason why I discuss this, is: I myself get upset at society for being so ignorant. I think it\u2019s something new when it\u2019s not. Bad habits are easy to make or create but not so easy to break. Material value, physical attachment, violence, rape, anything attached to a very low frequency of being. They\u2019re all deeply ingrained. Which means to redirect the path that we\u2019re on, it has to either come to a cataclysmic change, or it\u2019s going to take awhile to get back into true advancement. \n\nSo here is where my true conflict lies.  \n\nIs it justifiable to combat manipulation with manipulation. To fight the \u201cnegative programming\u201d with \u201cpositive programming\u201d. And if so, could we gather enough people to act as nodes if you will. To spark change within their daily communications with society. To Try informing and teaching new ways of constructing belief, or to show new value to old gold. \n\nThe \u201cmanipulation\u201d isn\u2019t malevolent, intentions are pure. Try to break old systems, build new ones with foundations of emotional intelligence, social intelligence and connectivity. Something that has a sustainable model. \n\nFor this \u201cseed\u201d to grow and flourish, we need to have the correct \u201cfarmers\u201d appointed. These green thumbs of the mind, whom are aware that \u201cideas\u201d are growing, living things. The idea hosts the correct body to convert or manifest itself into a physical matter of change. There are essentials when it comes to constructing the expression of an idea. The first part is, truly analyzing the concept that\u2019s been placed into your mind. You want to toy with the idea and see if it\u2019s elastic. If the idea can expand or if it\u2019s fixed. Now obviously the idea of complete societal restructuring is rather grandiose. So it takes a multitude of different minds to convert the idea into a physical manifestation. You have to make the idea so versatile and flexible that it can easily be digested by a wide spectrum of demographics. The idea itself cannot lose potency however, it\u2019s adaptability shouldn\u2019t saturate the concept. \n\nGoing into the next phase: Architecting: building proper vernacular that best displays the concept, structuring the delivery of the idea to produce maximum results. I don\u2019t think people realize just how impactful language is. It\u2019s overlooked. Language is the way we process incoming information, it\u2019s how we send and receive data. Vocally or via text/meme. It may seem like I\u2019m going into micro-details, and I am. When it comes to redirecting thousands of years of programming, those micro expressions are of utmost importance. It\u2019s the smallest subconscious seed that can rattle the pilot-conscience/conscious to its core. The architect constructs the best delivery method for those seeds. I.e. ideas. \n\nWe need people who are experts in cultivating minds. Getting the psyche prepared to process information outside of it\u2019s normal domain. Not only do we need the populous to be able to process the idea, but we need them to retain the idea without getting uncomfortable. The last thing we want is for people to build up walls. We see through defense mechanisms, because we are able to identify with defense mechanisms. ESO to EXO, know yourself so you may know others. \n\nI\u2019m going to keep building on this, but for those whom this resonates with: reach out and be the change. We are pioneers of the new. We need to establish connection and communication between us. \n\nFeed the idea. \n\n\nNow, create fruitful connections.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 77879, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A Call to All.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eiufef/a_call_to_all/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "drewr007", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2sae8f7h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577944170, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eiu6k1/my_resolution_for_2020_write_an_original/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eiu6k1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eiu6k1/my_resolution_for_2020_write_an_original/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577944171, "score": 1, "selftext": "Think of **that** in which the first thought arose  \n\nFeel that which gave **rise** to the first feeling  \n\nSee that in **which** all sight was born  \n\nStay until time tires, and **countless** voices merge to one \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExperience what **will** experience the very last moment   \n\nBreathe in that which will **draw** the very last breath  \n\nGo deep as **darkness** into the depths of your own being  \n\nAnd know the bottom has **depths** still left \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer- I am by no means a trained poet.

He almost never changes the channel unless he\u2019s actively watching; right now the tv is just playing FX full-time. First world problems, I know. But yesterday I walked past the TV and one of the newer \u2018transformers\u2019 movies was playing a scene where a little girl is walking up to one of the robots and she yelled:\n\u201cGo to Hell!\u201d \nto which the robot replies:\n \u201cThis planet is hell.\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t think much of it and half laughed at the fact that i heard an ancient gnostic convention from a movie about space car-robots, but just 10 minutes ago I mindlessly sat down on my step-fathers chair while eating and the same movie, same scene, and same exact lines repeated. It was pretty weird. I\u2019m always looking out for signs but this one in particular would be rather grim! However it is a fun thought to play around with. \n\nIf we are the universe experiencing itself, could the confines of living in a human body/society be seen as a sort of spiritual hell? \n\nThe word \u2018hell\u2019 is used loosely. Maybe it\u2019s an optional hell we choose to experience for growth or just variety. I feel this could be backed up by the fact that we are wiped of our memory the second we enter this realm. If we were to remember that this planet we often feel trapped in is only a momentary step in the evolution of our souls which chose to experience this, we would suffer a lot less.

My wife is an indigo child and a very old soul. According to an energy healer she sees, she is a very powerful healer herself, but has not remembered how to do everything on her own in this lifetime. She has astral projected. She has been out of body and talked to the dead. She has experienced a whole other slew of things that have my jaw on the floor everytime she comes home and talks to me about what it.\n\nBefore my wife I never discounted any sort of magic in the world. I am not religious but extremely open minded to everything spiritual because, why not? What do I know? What does anyone? That being said I never really believed anything either. Now after her visits with several healers, Reiki peoples, psychics and mediums I'm 31 years old and just realizing for the first time that magic, for lack of another term is legit real.\n\nI'm a big time black sheep in my family. My parents and sibling are very status quo and don't really understand anything outside of what a typical conservative small town white family from Canada might understand about the world. No religion or spiritual anything found in that home. I for my whole life have hated the status quo, was a punk rocker in highschool, very anti establishment and always very unhappy with the state of the world. I'm not sure how much this paragraph has to do anything but my point is I've always been different than almost everyone around me, and my wife's energy healer guy has informed her of such. He said that \"I am not a muggle\" and that I have a spirit mother unlike them, or something like that, who guides me\n\nI was very scared of the dark when I was a kid. Specifically of monsters and demons and aliens and whatever being was going to appear and scare the crap out of me at night to the point if I woke up in the middle of the night I quickly ran into my parents room and slept on their floor. \n\nIn my early adulthood, and before my wife, there were maybe 4 or 5 instances of me waking up to electronics fully operating and lights being on when they were not. For instance the most bizarre was I woke up, the apartment living room lights were all on, my computer was on and blasting Neil Young from a YouTube tab I left open. Computer was just off in rest mode. The open YouTube tab with music blasting must have happened on three seperate occasions. I always chalked it up to sleepwalking, which I have been known to do. Other instances have been me waking up in the middle of the night, lying there, and then all of the sudden the laptop 3 or 4 feet away on the bed just boots up on its own. Another time my phone started playing music. Some of these I can't chalk up to sleep walking!\n\nI have woken up at 3 or 4am on the dot so many freaking times in my life I literally refuse to look at the clock so I don't get spooked and not sleep for the rest of the night.\n\nSo I'm at a point now where I feel like everything in my life is pushing me towards a spiritual life. Almost literally. Signs are everywhere for me telling me to pursue this. I want to but I am also anxious.\n\nMy fear of \"the dark\" which isn't really of the lack of light but of what I don't understand of spirituality and what I now believe is present when I wake up, has made a return after almost 20 years to the point where I don't want to be alone in the house at night. In fact if my wife's not home and it's just me at home to sleep alone I have extreme anxiety and can't do it.\n\nI went to bed late the other night and albeit high off marijuana, as I was falling asleep my bed very noticeably started vibrating. I locked up nervous and basically thought in my head \"please don't do this right now I am not ready\". It eventually stopped but I really do believe it was something spirituak. My wife also gets visits but hers don't affect her nerves at all. She said she heard her name in a loud whisper the other night and just asked if it had something to tell her, but nothing.\n\nSo in summary, I want to be spiritual but am scared and I believe there are spirits around me and in my house at any given time.\n\nWhat do I need to know? Where do I start? Is there anything to actually be afraid of?\n\nI think one of the obvious things is I need to meditate. Anybody have any advice on that? I understand the basics and have practised a handful of times but never consistently.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 77757, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Need to make a change.

something important that I have been waiting to write about for a long time but I never felt ready to do it, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m waiting for but eventually I will, it\u2019s an important event and what triggered the change within myself that led me to where I am now, the story I\u2019m going to tell you today is related to that event.\n\nFew nights ago I had a dinner meeting with my flatmates to discuss about house issues and projects we want to do together, we stayed till late and slowly one by one people went to sleep except me and an other guy, we were talking about life, about this mystery that is the journey we all go through and how we spend so much time chasing the material ignoring the spiritual completely, after few hours that we were chatting an other flatmate joined the conversation, I was drunk and decided out of blue to tell a story that happened 6 years ago in London, I don\u2019t know why I come out with this story, normally I would tell it only to people that I\u2019m really close with but all I can think is that maybe was meant to be and that\u2019s the reason I might ended up living in this flat.\n\nSix years ago I woke up in the middle of the night with blue light of energy coming out of my fingers, I don\u2019t know why it happened and the reason but it changed me completely, that was the beginning of a new journey that slowly shaped the person I\u2019m becoming, I could not look at life in the same way as before, obviously something extraordinary happened, the other night I told them about that event disinterested about the reaction if they would think I was crazy, what I didn\u2019t think would be the answer from my France flatmate, he had the same experience and the way he reacted about it is the same as me, it was the first time to meet someone that could understand what I talked about and the day after we discussed about this, in his case happened a night in France, he was with friends and had few drinks, they were walking through a forest and was so dark that he couldn\u2019t see even the person in front of him, suddenly blue lights of energy begun to be emanated from his fingers, he stopped trying to figure out what was happening, he touched his body curious if it would stop but the lights would light up every parts he would touch, he told me lasted few seconds, mine lasted something like 5-10 minutes, after that episode same as me his life changed completely till the point he broke up with his girlfriend, quit his job and left France in a journey of self discovery, he begun to learn Reiki to see if what happened was a sign the he was a healer, after he done this course he felt he could redirect his energy to his hands, in the past month Reiki have been popping up everywhere, at first feeling the need to read articles about it, then a Fortuneteller in Malta kept saying that I should do Reiki, she said I need it to heal from energy blockages and then now my flatmate.\n\nThere was a reason to move in this flat, I could move here seven months ago when one of my customers that is an other flatmate told me about a room becoming available but then nothing happened, I believe I moved here now cause it was the right timing to meet the right people and to meet this France guy.\n\nIn the upcoming weeks I will get info about Reiki and then book an appointment to start the course, I don\u2019t know where he is going to lead me but I feel is something I have to do, everything and everyone is guiding me to that direction, I can\u2019t get back to the old way of seeing life and this new chapter seems an exciting one.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers":

Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of material nature.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nBy this knowledge, the body, the field of activities and the knowers of the body (both the individual soul and the Supersoul) can be known. The body is the field of activity and is composed of material nature. It is the individual soul which is embodied. Enjoying the activities of the body is the puru\u1e63a, or the living entity. He is one knower, and the other is the Supersoul. Of course, it is to be understood that both the Supersoul and the individual entity are different manifestations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The living entity is in the category of His energy, and the Supersoul is in the category of His personal expansion.\n\nBoth material nature and the living entity are eternal. That is to say that they existed before the creation. The material manifestation is from the energy of the Supreme Lord and so also are the living entities, but they are of the superior energy. Both of them existed before this cosmos was manifested. Material nature was absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mah\u0101-Vis\u1e47u, and when it was required, it was manifested by the agency of mahat-tattva. Similarly, the living entities are also in Him, and because they are conditioned, they are adverse to serving the Supreme Lord. Thus they are not allowed to enter into the spiritual sky. After the winding up of material nature, these living entities are again given a chance to act in the material world and prepare themselves to enter into the spiritual world. That is the mystery of this material creation. Actually the living entity is originally the spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but due to his rebellious nature, he is conditioned within material nature. It really does not matter how these living entities or superior entities of the Supreme Lord have come in contact with material nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead knows, however, how and why this actually took place. In the scriptures the Lord says that those attracted by this material nature are undergoing a hard struggle for existence. But we should know it with certainty from the descriptions of these few verses that all the transformations and influences of material nature by the three modes are also productions of material nature. All transformations and variety in respect to living entities are due to the body. As far as spirit is concerned, living entities are all the same.\n\n**Question 1 : How the living entity, Supersoul and the material nature related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead ? How the \"living entity and the Supersoul\" and \"living entity and the Material nature\" related to each other?

Different religions call it by different names but they all believe that there is a divine essence that allows the body to cross this existence that we call \u201cLife\u201d from the moment we are born until we die, what happens then is not yet certain, in the course of our existence we meet people, we live adventures, we grow and learn, among the many souls with whom we will happen to become traveling companions will establish ties that can last for a day or forever, but what allows these meetings to be only random or important ? Who or what makes it possible to bond with certain people more than with others? It seems that the soul is capable of recognizing who is on the same wavelength as us, something that the mind is not capable of.\n\n40 years have passed of this short adventure that we call \u201cLife\u201d and my body is beginning to show the first signs of rupture due to the inevitable expiry date that is part of this mystery that is The greatest adventure that we can live \u201cLife\u201d itself, two old friends have come to visit me and as always happens when we meet, time loses its importance, stops, nothing seems to have changed since we were young and strong, our bodies have changed, aches, pains, intolerances, hair and beards a little gray but the Soul has not aged, The Soul cannot grow old but can accumulate experience and mature, The Soul has no age and perhaps immortal, The Soul is able to recognize his fellow men and with whom he is comfortable, the body seems to be just a kind of shell that at some point will lose its usefulness and abandon us, but perhaps The Soul will continue in its adventure only in another form, I do not have an answer but I have no doubt that I was lucky to have met so many wonderful souls in these 40 years that have made this adventure a beautiful journey, I do not know when and how it will end but when my expiration date will arrive I can \u2018consider myself lucky to have met special souls that have allowed this trip to be full of beautiful memories and unforgettable moments", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 77623, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Soul and the biggest adventure\u2026..\u201dLife\u201d", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eiflqn/the_soul_and_the_biggest_adventurelife/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tw2691", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5cfhtrla", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577861094, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eif9uj/weird_feeling_while_meditating/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eif9uj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eif9uj/weird_feeling_while_meditating/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577861095, "score": 1, "selftext": "Honestly this feeling made me feel like I was crazy.\n\nI was meditating outside, and I looked around at the trees and felt incredibly peaceful.\n\nAlmost like a feel of belonging, and understanding.

You no longer send out energy of desperation or the need to be filled from the outside. You become a powerful source within yourself that attracts better. You\u2019re growing in ways you don\u2019t realize yet. You\u2019re being pushed out of your comfort zone to step into your truth. It\u2019s all about evolving right now.

But if you\u2019re doubtful and worried, rest assured, you don\u2019t need all the fancy terminology.\n\nIt\u2019s nice to discuss enlightenment.  It helps many people be mindful and present during their journey of becoming the best version of themselves, the most pure of heart and mind that they can be, and the most in tune with the world around them.  But if you\u2019re concerned you haven\u2019t \u201cachieved enlightenment\u201d, try to let your heart be calm.  We complicate many things that are meant to be simple.\n\nI can\u2019t speak for anybody else, we all do what works for us, as it should be. But it seems to me that the point of it all likely isn\u2019t to transcend all earthly things, transcend all emotions, transcend all the fundamental things that make us human.  Though I intimately understand why so many want to.\n\nI think really, it\u2019s all at once simpler and harder than all that.  Because everything, whether a person is spiritual or not, believes in God or not, values science or spirituality or both or neither, comes from literally any walk of life on this planet, *everything* can be boiled down to, explained by, achieved by, prevented by, and if nothing else treated by kindness.\n\nI don\u2019t know the point (if there is one) of the worst atrocities and suffering, the kind that make me cry when I read the news, though you hardly have to seek out the news to see it at this point.  Mankind always treats this as the wildcard in the hand the universe holds.  That unexplainable thing keeping any belief system from resonating 100%.  \u201cWhy all the suffering and pain?\u201d  I\u2019ve screamed it out myself.\n\nI don\u2019t know why.  I think the whole discourse in general is missing the point.  Maybe I\u2019m wrong.   What I do know is kindness transcends belief system or lack thereof.  It works for the devout, the scientists, the atheists, the rich, poor, the innocent and the guilty.  It doesn\u2019t need proved or disproved or debated.  How much of that suffering could be prevented by kindness?  And in the case of unpreventable tragedy or pain - from illness to natural disaster to one more hard day that was so painful a person feels they can\u2019t carry the weight anymore - how much of it could be eased by kindness?  Not all, but some, and like a rock thrown out into the lake it doesn\u2019t just stay where you put it.  As the area of effect grows, so do we all grow.\n\nKindness is not always easy in a world this hard.  And nothing else will singularly evolve you, soul and spirit, advance you on your path, create ripple effects, improve the lives and hope of countless others, put you more in tune with your environment, and at least leave this place a little better than you found it.  \n\nEnjoy exploring and learning and speculating and discussing.

I had a question that I was hoping others could help me with, see what other minds may say.\n\n5 years ago I met with a therapist. I was undergoing a spiritual transformation where my spirit guides started making themselves known. They were kind of rough and it was a very difficult time, so I sought a therapist. It was the first time I started to realize that I wasn\u2019t alone in my consciousness.\n\nThe therapist was an attractive older woman that I developed a bit of a crush on. She was also very spiritual and new age, really the only person I\u2019ve met who believes in the new age (not popular where I live). The therapy itself was disastrous as my spiritual awakening was a runaway train, I was confused and I spent my time in therapy hitting on her. \n\nI stopped going after a few months because my consciousness developed a mind that seems to mimic her. This other mind inspires new age thoughts (she was my first exposure to the new age), feminism and other social consciousness and constantly influences my thoughts to think of her and her personality. It also tries to influence me to go back to therapy with her but I\u2019ve honestly become scared of this woman because it\u2019s been five years and I think more of her than anyone. \n\nWhat is this? I\u2019ve wondered if it\u2019s her higher self, a spirit that knows us both, my own spirit guide taking the piss.\n\nWhat does it mean? Am I connected to this woman somehow? Can I somehow absolve myself of this connection?\n\nThis personality in my consciousness isn\u2019t altogether unpleasant and often I don\u2019t want her to leave. It\u2019s the only consistent, long lasting voice in my head that\u2019s \u2018modelled\u2019 after a real person (no other human voice stays long or without breaks) and she is pleasant enough. I just get frustrated at times because I feel like an entity like this should be someone that I\u2019ve actually been intimate with or actually knew. I sometimes feel emasculated and a cuckold.

I\u2019m not religious. I believe anything is possible however. Now,I\u2019m curious to hear what you guys think based on if the consciousness exists separate from the body.\n\n\n\nSay that someone you know used to be very friendly. They were the kind of person that would help a stranger as much as they could. Perhaps even the kind of person that would give their life to save someone else\u2019s. But now they grow old. Their mind changes. Now they are short and kind of bitter or angry. They aren\u2019t \u201cright\u201d in the head anymore. It\u2019s like they are a different person... \n\n\n\nWell if this is possible,or even getting brain trauma in an accident can change your personality,isn\u2019t it possible that the \u201cconsciousness\u201d or \u201csoul\u201d is mostly innocent? Maybe those horrible murderers out there are just unable to feel empathy or compassion. Their view on morality is very warped. They just can\u2019t see clearly. But perhaps if their consciousness was in your shoes,they\u2019d see how wrong it is to do things they\u2019d done. No body should suffer in eternal hell either(from a religious perspective). Maybe the soul has a little bit to do with personality. But maybe many of people\u2019s\u2019 brains are \u201cdefective\u201d . It\u2019s like looking out a dark tinted window for them,and a much more clear window for someone like you.\n\n\n\nI know this is deep. I\u2019m just curious if anyone else can fathom what I\u2019m saying. Some people believe souls are reincarnated as well and the spirit is the fault. Or that the body the soul lives in is made specifically for the spirit. But then again,genetics and stuff effect personality right?

His work is a non-fiction literature on the junction of psychology, sociology, self-development, spiritual growth and different world-view.\n\nAlexandr started to write his books at the age of sixteen. He wrote about his personal observations and sociological experiments in human behavior.\n\nHis early works were published online and gained a lot of popularity.\n\nNowadays his early works known as \u201cDrafts\u201d can be freely downloaded from his website.\n\nThe first paperback book \u201cThe Corridor\u201d was published in the Spring of 2018 in \u201cPeter\u201d publishing house. In the book the author introduces readers to the basic concepts of frequencies, the \u201cmold\u201d, attention management, world with \u201cno mind\u201d and many others. Author talks about the main principles of human interaction, the sources and consequences of human actions. He gives a lot of real life examples of real people and their life\u2019s attitude which brings good or unfortunate consequences.\n\n\u201cThe Corridor\u201d became a best seller very fast and the first edition was sold out within first two weeks.\n\nThe following book \u201cParadox\u201d was published not long after the first one, on the late autumn 2018 in the same publishing house.\n\nUnlike \u201cThe Corridor\u201d which is highly structures and follows certain narrative, \u201cParadox\u201d consists of diary style texts that describes the events and changes that happen in the author\u2019s life during certain period of time. The text reflects deep observation on self-development as well as patterns of society and human behavior. \u201cParadox\u201d is not a sequel for \u201cThe Corridor\u201d rather it is an atmospheric addition to it.\n\nThe book leads the reader to invisible world where thoughts are formed without mind, and right intentions appear as by themselves.\n\nThe audience of Alexandr consist of people of unusual kind from different strata. They can be creative people (musicians, actors, photographers, etc.) who draw the inspiration from his books.\n\nBut also logical kind who try to understand how the world around us operates.\n\nAmong them there are IT geeks, start-upers and other non-conservative characters.\n\nFinally spiritual audience are very drawn to the work of Alexandr. Those ones who feel more and have an unusual perception of the world, they feel as if the author is close to them.\n\n[akinformation books](https://akinformation.com/en/blog/about-the-author/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 77431, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Free spiritual Books if you are interested", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ei04jx/free_spiritual_books_if_you_are_interested/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "thatguy_96", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_d1394q9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577778432, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ehzutc/how_to_get_rid_of_negative_reconditioning_in/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ehzutc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General"}], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ehzutc/how_to_get_rid_of_negative_reconditioning_in/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577778432, "score": 1, "selftext": "The first 7 years of a person's life are very receptive to vibrations.

This process is very dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person who is engaged in such a process. The question who is better-one who is engaged in the path of impersonal Brahman or one who is engaged in the personal service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead-was raised by Arjuna, and the Lord replied to him so explicitly that there is no doubt that devotional service to the Personality of Godhead is the best of all processes of spiritual realization. In other words, in this chapter it is decided that through good association, one develops attachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual master and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative principles of devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and thus becomes engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path is recommended in this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional service is the only absolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme Absolute Truth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the time one surrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does not have the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal conception may be beneficial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth one works without fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to understand spirit and matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the association of a pure devotee. Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to undergo step by step improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service, as described in the middle six chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is more congenial. One need not bother about materials to keep body and soul together because by the grace of the Lord everything is carried out automatically.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Twelfth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Devotional Service.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the two methods of self-realization discussed in this chapter ? Which one of them is the best and why ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/ehzhd7/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1220/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 77419, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 12.20", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ehzhkl/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1220/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "biggdickkblly", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ndqfmss", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577774853, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ehzb0x/is_it_true_that_whatever_you_think_or_want_to_be/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ehzb0x", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ehzb0x/is_it_true_that_whatever_you_think_or_want_to_be/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577774854, "score": 1, "selftext": "I heard stories that say when a person thinks of something at the moment of death,they become that?Say that if I thought of my girlfriend/wife at the moment of my death,I'd be born as a woman in my next life.What do you think?Then what about karma?Isn't the next body we get based on karma?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 77416, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is it true that whatever you think or want to be at the moment of death,you'll become in your next life?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ehzb0x/is_it_true_that_whatever_you_think_or_want_to_be/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "starwolfsden", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3dzxu6n8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577773680, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ehz412/spirituality_isnt_a_race_its_a_process_dont_bash/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ehz412", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ehz412/spirituality_isnt_a_race_its_a_process_dont_bash/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577773680, "score": 1, "selftext": "There's something that's been grinding my gears for some time now and I just had to get it off of my chest.

Although many disciples (at least initially) may have a genuine need for spiritual growth, this is usually combined with a much more unhealthy impulse: a regression to a child-like state of unconditional devotion and irresponsibility. This is a very appealing state to be in. Think of how wonderful it felt as a young child, to believe that your parents were in complete control of the world, and could protect you from everything. There was nothing to worry about; your parents had it all covered. And you worshipped them so devotedly that you unquestioningly accepted everything they said and did.\u00a0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Guru worship takes\u00a0worshipers back to that infant state. As long as the disciple is in the care of the guru, all is well in the world. They feel safe and secure, just as children do in the presence of their parents. They give up responsibility for their own lives and pass it on to the guru, just as children do. And the guru is a perfect being, who cannot behave unethically. He can accumulate millions of dollars, own 93 Rolls Royces, have his own armed security team, and regularly humiliate his followers, but they\u00a0will always find some excuse for this appalling behaviour, in the same way that children will refuse to believe that their parents can do wrong. The disciples will claim that the guru's abuse and cruelty is a form of \u2018divine play\u2019 or a way of testing their followers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Any initial impulse that the disciples may have felt to spiritually awaken is usually subsumed by this regression. The guru doesn\u2019t lead them to enlightenment, but to infantile [narcissism](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/basics/narcissism). They may feel a sense of oneness or\u00a0bliss in the company of the guru, but this isn\u2019t genuine enlightenment, but more akin to the sense of oneness that a baby feels with their mother.\n\n[https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/out-the-darkness/201904/the-guru-syndrome](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/out-the-darkness/201904/the-guru-syndrome)", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 20&amp;#39;s were basically a time of investing my faith in &amp;quot;gurus&amp;quot; until they fell off their pedestals.

That's part of it sure but not what it's pointing to. Nothingness is pointing to an emptiness. Not an emptiness of your body. You are not, I repeat, you are not being erased. A giant eraser will not appear and begin violently rubbing from the top of your head. It obviously points to emptiness of mind and thought. If there is no mind, there is no I, if there is no I, there is nothing. Now 'you' are in 'your body.'\n\nBut 'I exist' the mind continues. \"Look here, I'm in a body. Non-duality means I am both me and the universe.\" No.\nEnlightenment is said to be non-dual in nature. It's important to see that 'non-duality' isn't a thing. It's the absence of duality. Non-duality is pointing to Isness. It's just a pointer not It. The Now, Noumenon, the Eternal Moment, Tao, comes in many names but they are all ultimately pointers not the Thing in Itself.\n\nNow remember, words are always pointers. If you see a word or phrase and think that that idea or concept is Reality, then you are just believing a piece of high wisdom and then using that belief to feel special about it(with the ego intact) A word like Awareness or a phrase like Aware of being Aware. These are great pointers as they are fine gateways into the dimension of Now, the portal to 'Enlightenment;' a term/concept that is also just another pointer however. It all points back to \"you\" in this moment. Chop wood, carry water can be done in an empty state.(Mu, that Is.) In fact, this is how wood is cut and water is moved in its most natural state.\n\nSo let's be clear about this. Mu or Emptiness is not laziness, while it can surely be it as well. Mu manifested is a state of mental, physical, and spiritual perfection and alignment, One that allows 'new eyes' so to speak, that is to say that Now, the eyes are found.

toward Peace starts in each one of our hearts.\nWe live in an enviroment of free will. \nPeace is an active choice one makes.\n\nThe second plane of Peace is in our minds.\nAre we at peace with ourselvess?\nOne should strive towards being at Peace. \nEven if one experiences chaos.\nA part of life lies in learning how to handle internal and external conflict.\nThere have been times of struggle,\nBut would we ever know the true value of Peace if we never had any Conflict?\nWould the beings on this planet become as developed without any threats?\nThe dark portion of this world is not without rhyme or reason, it is to teach us about the Light.\n\nFor a long share of Mankinds recent history many have gotten to know what War truly is.\nIt might seem unfortunate, and it is unfortunate.\nBut lessons are constantly being learned.\nToday most people on this planet are living in peaceful conditions.\nThe power of compassion, love and unity is seeping through the fabric of our society. \nRigid structures are an opportunity to make the choice of being free.\nThe individuals themselves are deciding the kind of world they want to live in.\nWhatever anyone says I know my choice in life.\n\nI choose Cooperation and Peace.\nI choose to be positive.\nWe are in this boat together, and together we all shall sail. \nEach and every one of us is unique, perfect and needed in the crew.\n\nI know that if all of the peaceful people of this world unite in heart, our light will illuminate the Planet and this Universe. \nBut the choice needs to be made.\nUnited in our hearts we shall do true wonders.\n\nLet us all shine together with the Love and Light of God.\nBe blessed every single one of my siblings, I wish you all of the best.\n\nPS.\nI have started a discord server where we will start holding Global Peace meditations. \nEveryone is welcome and all subjects can be discussed.\nhttps://discord.gg/ZpW7nC\n\nDS.\nI just wanted to write DS once in my life.\nCool lol,

I had no social skills and there was no chance of me getting a job, given how broken I was. I was depressed and wanted to kill myself everyday, which gave me the excuse to waste everyday abusing drugs and masturbating. \n\nThen I found a friend through reddit who had psilocybin mushrooms. I tried them one night at his house. It was an experience that changed my life. They went to a party, but as I lay there in the darkness of my friend\u2019s room, I had visions of how I could change my life. The answer was juggling.\n\nYou see, we have a finite amount of time to spend each day. This makes our time our most valuable resource. I was wasting so much of mine that I was trapping myself in the hell I created. These visions allowed me to understand that if I wanted to be free, I would need to start putting the work in every day to recondition myself.\n\nBecause addiction is a tough battle, I tried to maximize the amount of time I was productive, so at least I would have something to keep my hands busy. I tried increasing the amount of time I would write for, but got stuck with writer\u2019s block often because I am a kinesthetic thinker. I need to move to think, so I would pace for upwards of several hours every day. It was an improvement, but still not ideal.\n\nThen, while passing my brother\u2019s toybox, I got the idea to toss a ball around. This led to me trying two balls, and that blossomed into many ideas for how I could use juggling as another skill to juxtapose my writing. I could spend the time I was stuck practicing juggling, and just juggle freely, thus increasing the amount of time I was not compelled to use and masturbate.\n\nAs time went on, I thought of many other ways that juggling could be used. I saw it as a way to go out in public and perhaps meet some people, which would give me a chance to improve my social skills. It\u2019s been a journey, but over the last five years I have become a completely different person. I still battle with addiction, but at least I am on the path to complete recovery and spend each day moving forward towards making my dreams a reality. \n\nI\u2019m currently homeless across the country in Portland, but I am positive and hopeful as I fulfill my higher purpose in life. I feel that I am in the most transformative period of my life, and on the precipice of breaking out of my shell fully and becoming part of a community. I try to juggle every day downtown as a way to combat my addictive nature and it also helps me get more comfortable interacting with people in public. I love putting smiles on kids\u2019 faces, so it makes me feel as though I am serving some higher purpose - a very important part of my recovery.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 77324, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Juggling is an incredible spiritual activity for me because of what it has done for my life", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ehsk7i/juggling_is_an_incredible_spiritual_activity_for/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "11infinity33", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4i8ko7sr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577740614, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ehsahs/michael_tsarion/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ehsahs", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ehsahs/michael_tsarion/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577740615, "score": 1, "selftext": "Has anyone on here checked this guy out?

manifesting my dreams in 2017.\n\nMy first goal was to attract my soulmate and my second goal was to manifest better health.\n\nSince then, I have already manifested my soulmate.\n\nI have also manifested better health because these days I hit the gym three to five times a week.\n\nI feel amazing.\n\nAfter I manifested the love of my life and better health, I wanted to make more money to be able to travel around the globe with my soulmate.\n\nIn December 2019 I started manifesting more money.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks, I randomly made $24.90 from an old YouTube video.\n\nIt\u2019s not much but it\u2019s a start.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m certain that the law of attraction is real and I know that I will make so much more money\u2026\n\nMoney has never been my goal, my goal is happiness.\n\nBut like Kanye West once said: Having money is not everything but not having it is.\n\nEverything will become a lot easier when you get a fat paycheck.\n\nI also love the fact that money can be used to help other people.\n\n**The love of attraction is real. I have witnessed it and that\u2019s why\u2026** \n\n&gt;I believe that these 148 money affirmations will help you and me to attract more money &amp; wealth into our lives.\n\nMay the *new year bring* you an *abundance* of Money!\n\nIf you are ready to attract more wealth, please read my blog post.

We will be Starting Bhagavad-gita Verse by Verse exercise again from 13th Feb 2020.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**For one who worships Me, giving up all his activities unto Me and being devoted to Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always meditating upon Me, who has fixed his mind upon Me, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, for him I am the swift deliverer from the ocean of birth and death.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nIt is explicitly stated here that the devotees are very fortunate to be delivered very soon from material existence by the Lord. In pure devotional service one comes to the realization that God is great and that the individual soul is subordinate to Him. His duty is to render service to the Lord-if not, then he will render service to m\u0101y\u0101.\n\nAs stated before, the Supreme Lord can only be appreciated by devotional service. Therefore, one should be fully devoted. One should fix his mind fully on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in order to achieve Him. One should work only for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It does not matter in what kind of work one engages, but that work should be done only for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the standard of devotional service. The devotee does not desire any achievement other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His life's mission is to please K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he can sacrifice everything for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's satisfaction, just as Arjuna did in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. The process is very simple: one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at the same time in chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Such transcendental chanting attracts the devotee to the Personality of Godhead.\n\nThe Supreme Lord herein promises that He will without delay deliver a pure devotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence. Those who are advanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet they like by the yoga process, and others take the opportunity in various ways, but as far as the devotee is concerned, it is clearly stated here that the Lord Himself takes him. He does not need to wait to become very experienced in order to transfer himself to the spiritual sky.\n\nIn the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a this verse appears:\n\nnay\u0101mi parama\u1e41 sth\u0101nam arcir\u0101di-gati\u1e41 vin\u0101\n\ngaru\u1e0da-skandham \u0101ropya yatheccham aniv\u0101rita\u1e25\n\nThe purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets. The responsibility is taken by the Supreme Lord Himself. He clearly states here that He Himself becomes the deliverer. A child is completely cared for by his parents, and thus his position is secure. Similarly, a devotee does not need to endeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other planets. Rather, the Supreme Lord, by His great mercy, comes at once, riding on His bird carrier Garu\u1e0da, and at once delivers the devotee from this material existence. Although a man who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may be very expert in swimming, he cannot save himself. But if someone comes and picks him up from the water, then he is easily rescued. Similarly, the Lord picks up the devotee from this material existence. One simply has to practice the easy process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service. Any intelligent man should always prefer the process of devotional service to all other paths. In the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u012bya this is confirmed as follows:\n\ny\u0101 vai s\u0101dhana-sampatti-puru\u1e63\u0101rtha-catu\u1e63\u1e6daye\n\ntay\u0101 vin\u0101 tad-\u0101pnoti naro n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101\u015braya\u1e25\n\nThe purport of this verse is that one should not engage in the different processes of fruitive activity or cultivate knowledge by the mental speculative process. One who is devoted to the Supreme Personality can attain all the benefits derived from other yogic processes, speculation, rituals, sacrifices, charities, etc. That is the specific benediction of devotional service.\n\nSimply by chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare-a devotee of the Lord can approach the supreme destination easily and happily, but this destination cannot be approached by any other process of religion.\n\nThe conclusion of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is stated in the Eighteenth Chapter:\n\nsarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja\n\naha\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 sarva-p\u0101pebhyo mok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi m\u0101 \u015buca\u1e25.\n\nOne should give up all other processes of self-realization and simply execute devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That will enable one to reach the highest perfection of life. There is no need for one to consider the sinful actions of his past life because the Supreme Lord fully takes charge of him. Therefore one should not futilely try to deliver himself in spiritual realization. Let everyone take shelter of the supreme omnipotent Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the highest perfection of life.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the process of performing devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness ? What should be the main aim of doing this devotional service ? How the Lord reciprocate with such a devotee ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/ehjwxe/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1267/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 77215, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 12.6-7", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ehjx95/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1267/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "VolcanicAa", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5bdm9c60", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577697636, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ehjw8v/vaccines_and_spirituality/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ehjw8v", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 32, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ehjw8v/vaccines_and_spirituality/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577697637, "score": 1, "selftext": "do vaccines affect spirituality in any way", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 77215, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "vaccines and spirituality", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ehjw8v/vaccines_and_spirituality/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "redditKeyy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4cycidz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577693563, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ehjbgz/do_not_entertain_the_stories_beliefs_and_thoughts/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ehjbgz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ehjbgz/do_not_entertain_the_stories_beliefs_and_thoughts/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577693568, "score": 1, "selftext": "You appear to have many problems, but there is a legitimate solution to all of these at once.   \nThe identity you think you are is your biggest problem because it is the one thinking and believing created problems of the mind. While in the present moment, there are literally no problems at all. \n\nBy the present moment, I do not mean what your identity might think; \"My life is shitty right now! I have the problems right now! This isn't helping me!\"\n\nRather, I mean if you would turn off all these thoughts, and be present for a few moments. See really what is going on around you. Be aware that you are aware. For a few moments unplug, and just exist. Be. The identity you think you are has created many problems, but it is only the identity that has these problems. Not the being. And you **are** the being.\n\nSo by unplugging and reconnecting with your own source, the beingness itself, the sense of \"I Am\", you can actually see life with clarity. Life does not really have a story, the only story there is, is the one created by the identity which itself is made up by the mind. There is no actual necessity to keep these stories up. In fact, it only takes away from your natural presence, the beingness within you. Every single thought you identify your self with, you vibrate lower, and you are less present, and less likely to see life for what it truly is.\n\nIf you were to unplug and see what is actually going on in the present moment, like waking up from a dream of stories, you would see that peace, love, and joy are all present. They are the natural perfume of the beingness. And you **are** that beingness. It is not separate from you, it is all you are actually. You just **think** you are something else, and you identify with these thoughts. Are thoughts necessary for being and functioning in the world? Definitely not.   \nIf you are thinking all the time, you have nothing to think about except thoughts. \\~Alan watts\n\nThis means, that you are not seeing life, you are not thinking about life, rather you are generating more thoughts about already existing thoughts. You have a thought saying \"I am not good enough\" and then you start thinking about \"How do I become good enough?\" but you are just thinking about thoughts. Not about reality. You have completely identified with these thoughts, and now instead of being, you are thinking. That is not our nature. We do not **exist** to think. We exist to be.  \nYou do not have to stress about anything, blame anything, want anything, desire anything, imagine anything, conceptualize anything, think of anything, you are **allowed to just be.**   \nSimply be, be alive. Exist. When you are in your natural effortless state, your perfume is joy, love, peace, and compassion.\n\nWe are such a wonderful being, you are allowed and it is **good for you** to actually be present, with your own beingness. The less we are (being) the more we suffer. It is not necessary! Suffering is believed to be something that is literally life itself. \n\nSuffering is rooted in thoughts, beliefs, ideas, concepts, emotions, sensations, imagination and attachments that you are identifying with. If you were to not identify with anything at all, you are literally **unable** to suffer. Your beingness **can't suffer.**\n\nYou are currently identifying as an identity made up by your mind, which is a \"sufferer\".  \nNow, you are aware of this identity \"sufferer\", otherwise you wouldn't be identifying as this sufferer.\n\nThis inevitably means that there is an awareness of even this awareness otherwise this observation couldn't be made.\n\nSo there is an identity you are currently identifying as, a \"sufferer\".  \nThere is an awareness of this identity.\n\nThen there is **you, the beingness**, the witness of the awareness. You, the witness of awareness were simply conditioned to believe you are the identity while in fact you were the witness of all of this movie since forever and will be the witness forever. You are **always the beingness**.\n\nAnything you can be aware of is not you. Go back within and see what can be seen. Identity is seen. Awareness of identity is seen. Awareness of the awareness of the identity, can that be seen? No. That is you. The beingness, source, universal consciousness.\n\nAlways remember, life (the universe) takes care of life (you, beingness, also the universe). You are not abandoned, nor can you be abandoned. There is no separate being to be abandoned. Just as you are being, the whole universe is being. \n\nThe identity you are identifying as can feel and think it is abandoned, but that identity is not you. It is just a thought in your mind that you are identifying as.  \nYou, the beingness, did not come to this life, nor will you ever go. You are eternal. You are the observer of this movie.  \nWhat appears to be a problem is the identity you currently identify as. The identity is naturally creating problems, it is its job you could say. It is just thinking and conceptualizing and imagining more problems in every moment. That is why your life seems overwhelming. Instead of being aware, you identify as this identity that is **bound** to have problems. \n\nYou completely bought the stories, ideas, concepts, thoughts and beliefs that this identity has created, instead of simply **being aware of them. Your nature is to just be. Be aware.** You forgot your nature because of the society which conditioned you to be some kind of identity. You have a choice to take a step back and stop identifying as this made-up identity, it is not essentially what you are. Not even close.\n\n  \nBe aware. Live. That is your purpose. Exist. You are already supreme, you are already perfect.\n\nWhen people say \"The universe has abandoned us, he did not create as complete, he did not create us whole!\" you already know who is making up these thoughts and beliefs. It is the identity. Well, even the identity is not abandoned.\n\nImagine if there was no at least some sense of peace, some sense of beingness, all these made up stories by the mind and all these problems that are created by the identity, it is unlikely you did not kill your self yet. Something is holding you from doing that. There is a higher power which makes you feel as if not all is lost. There is something taking care of you, even when it seems like your whole existence is just one big problem and suffering. Somehow you keep on living.\n\nThat is the sense of beingness. The beingness itself is complete, it is whole, it is joyful, it is loving, it is compassionate, it is peaceful, and **you are it**. You simply keep identifying the beingness (you) with a suffering identity!  \nYou do not need, want, or have to be anything nor do anything. The universe truly, made you perfect. Whole. Complete.\n\nThe beingness does not need to work on anything.  \nThe identity will work on one thing, and another thing will come up. It is a never-ending, vicious cycle of suffering. (But only the identity is suffering, not you, the beingness!)  \nThe key is to simply be aware of these thoughts, stories, beliefs, ideas, and not identifying and interacting with the mind when it presents all of this nonsense. It means nothing at all.  \nThe identity is taking life and its story extremely personally. That is the root of its suffering. The identity is **bound** to taking things personally, as the identity itself is **personal**, but the **beingness** is **impersonal**. The beingness **takes no offense, can't experience suffering, it can't even die.** The only thing that appears to be able to \"die\" is the identity. As this body returns back to earth, it means truly, the end of this made-up identity. There is no rebirth into this identity. \n\nWhat is meant by the saying \"Die before you die\" is exactly this, the death of the identity, while you, the beingness still are. The death of the identity, will set you free. You will be able to experience life wholly, not limited by an identity with certain beliefs, thoughts, ideas, concepts, imagination, attachments, desires, emotions and sensations. You can be completely free of all of these things. You **can reverse conditioning, and be the natural beingness that you are, all the time.**\n\nTruth is, life just is. It has nothing to do with the identity you are currently identifying as.   \nSimply, be, observe and enjoy the movie. This perspective will let you see everything clearly, and from there life will be blissful, full of joy, full of love, full of peace, full of compassion because truly, that is the nature of your being.  \nDo not continue to entertain all of these stories in your mind. **Stop** interacting with them. **Be still**. **Do nothing.**  \n**Stay as awareness, as your self.**\n\nPeople might say \"This is spiritual bypassing\", and you must not believe them! These are the forces of the universe trying to hold you back from experiencing the true beingness, the completeness that you are, I am not asking you to believe me. I am asking you to see for your self. There is no reason to listen to someone who is here just to deny the truth.   \nThe ones who deny the truth, are suffering **so much** that they can't even see a different perspective, it does not have to be you. You can unplug, see for your self that existence is beautiful. You already know all of this in your heart, you just need to remember your self.

Sometimes we get so caught up in it that we think that our life is completely ruined and there\u2019s no way of recovering. We can recover and we can get better, put your mind to it and your brain will make it your reality. Both our minds and body\u2019s will heal naturally.\n\nWe fall into a illusion thinking that there is a perfect life without struggles and hardships. We get fixated on that thought and we eventually believe in this delusion. Not one person in the history of humankind hasn\u2019t been through a struggle whether internally or externally. What we think as perfect simply doesn\u2019t exist without a struggle, in order to be successful you have to fail.\n\nThe point I\u2019m trying to make is that every struggle makes us stronger. Motivation is essential for overcoming any mishaps that occurs in daily life, you have to find that motivation and fixate on it instead of falling into delusions of thought. Once you overcome the bad you can learn from it, that\u2019s why you have to embrace the struggle. Then in the future you\u2019ll realize that you are strong and that you can overcome anything that life throws at you because you fought through the hardest situation.\n\nThat\u2019s why elders are the best people to talk to, over the course of their entire lives they experienced struggle.

Once you experience the lowest of low then you\u2019ll be stronger and you can help others who are facing what you once faced. Appreciate the struggle because you will soon find out that it\u2019s the thing in your life that made you strong.

going deep on Star Wars, duality, and Eastern philosophy. I had a nervous breakdown associated with being a content creator on the internet as well as not really knowing what to make of my life, but I encountered Alan Watts (British philosopher and popularizer of Eastern philosophy for Western audiences) who really helped me get through that period. I think what I might have gone through is a mild episode of psychosis, literally like 5%. I filled a whole bunch of notebooks up with symbolic jargon that I thought was connected to Einstein and what not. I knew that what I was undergoing was sort of just... mental movements, so I waited, and waited, to feel normal again and less detached from society and it's problems. In recent weeks, I've finally convinced myself that I'm ready to share this experience with others.   \n\n\nI've linked to part three of the video above. You can watch parts one and two with these links. I have more parts coming, but I figured now would be a good time to pop this over here and see if anyone had any similar experiences. I didn't want to spam this page, so I waited to make a few parts and will only make this post, those who are interested can choose to follow the rest on their own. One video that I came across, which gave me the confidence to share my story without fear of being crazy, was [Psychosis or Spiritual Awakening?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFtsHf1lVI4&amp;t=) in which a man tells the story of a fella who was depressed, named Adam. He also filled up a notebook with symbolic jargon on his path to recovery, and the person telling his story (Phil Borges) argues for seeing such experiences not through the lens of a stigma, but from the perspective of them being necessary for change and growth, particularly when it comes to our spiritual sides.   \n\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading this post.

Doing nothing productive.\n\nWhat\u2019s funny is. A few years ago (I\u2019m 24). I would NEVER be at home for more than a day or few hours. I was out and about trying new things-living.\n\nI feel like it has a lot to do with where I live-I have done it all and seen it all here. I hate it tbh. It\u2019s not a bad place per se but I\u2019m starting to grow and I don\u2019t think this place is for me anymore. I no longer feel like I fit in.

I don\u2019t even look at my phone when I\u2019m visiting somewhere new-even boring places. \n\nI know people will say it\u2019s because \u201cit\u2019s a new place\u201d and that if I move that will wear off.

I was also told that spirit is about to push me to do something if I don\u2019t listen and do it myself. This isn\u2019t a threat but maybe a warning??\n\nIdk what do you guys think? Is this depression and I\u2019m in denial about it or do I really need to get the fuck out of where I\u2019m leaving and I\u2019ll love life again. I\u2019m about rid to pack up and randomly leave in the middle night-that\u2019s how unhappy I am here.  I have great friends and family.

For a while now I\u2019ve had this image of the universe as a runaway reaction in which everything that occurs is a result but nothing in particular is responsible. We\u2019re all just caught in a cycle of causation, which keeps leading to new life forms coming into existence who need to learn everything from the start again.  All wisdom we gain in this lifetime will have to be gained once more in another lifetime. There is no victory, nothing to be grasped at, just an endless cycle of birth and death in which we have made ourselves the main character.\n\nThere tends to be a view in spirituality that because we are one with the universe we have some claim over its creative ability. But what about the other side of the argument? That our illusion of control traps us into creating a false drama out of our lives, when really our bodies are just living out the same vision as a drop of water or a rock? Everything we create or experience will be swallowed into the abyss, and then we are dictated upon to do it all over again with no knowledge of the repetition.\n\nThis seems to be the Buddhist view of things: the turning wheel of Samsara being existence and Nirvana being the (only) escape by destroying all perceived relationships with that existence.  This seems very grim indeed, from the point of view of our little meat sacks.

Things only seem to happen when the mind comes in and gives meaning or commentary to life. But ultimately, nothing ever happens. It's like how on the surface of the ocean, waves come and go, but deep down in the water nothing is happening. There's just stillness, even as the animals in the water do their thing. Their movement doesn't disturb the ocean. The *here and now* is a vast space that allows the appearance of things happening, but it's all consciousness; object, animals and people. So there really are no dialogues, verbal communication is only ever just a monologue.\n\nI've always liked seeing this idea of nothing happening illustrated in movies, even though there aren't many like that. The few that come to mind are *'Slacker'*  and *'Before Sunrise'* by Richard Linklater, and also *'Paterson'* by Jim Jarmusch. Nothing really happens in these  movies, especially in '*Paterson'* which just focuses on a guy who is a bus driver and also a poet living his daily life doing simple things. He wakes up in the morning with no alarm, goes to work, listens to people's conversations on the bus and memorises his poetry and writes it down later. After work he goes to the bar and only ever has just one drink and then goes home, There's not really any drama, it's just simple day to day moments. I find watching movies like this always intensifies my being present and I always feel very light and free after watching them.\n\nAll of this inspired me to create something of my own that has this quality of nothing really happening. So I wrote a song about hanging out with this girl one day when nothing really happened. No drama, no stress, no ego. Just simple moment to moment existence. Here's one of the lyrics from the song:\n\n&gt;...nothing ever happened; we ate and we talked, looked up at the stars then went for a walk. Easy living, because nothing ever happens....even in the past homie, nothing ever happened.\n\nThe songs is called [*'Nothing Ever Happens'*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bLchFsxMzg&amp;t=16s) and for the video for it, I used clips from the movie '*Before Sunrise'* .\n\nI don't know why I'm sharing this.

I had a feeling similar to how I described the place but still very hard to explain. Pretty basic, but in summary above the universe there was a much much higher being (god) looking over everything, just observing.  I felt very weird and in a way it is impossible to explain. Yes I know this is very common that there is a god looking over us. But this was different as you didn't die to reach the higher place. You had to simply walk out of this universe into the higher place. Just leave, no specific location or portal to get there, just leave and I did it in the dream and ended up with this \"god\" just observing. I believe there is your brain your mind makes you make the right decisions but what if you went completely against it and do something completely unorthodox not just something just leave and be in the place, I remember walking through a blue glow than I was with the \"god\" so to get there I believe you go completely against your mind remove all consequences, temptations, everything and leave.

The process of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, although ultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome, whereas the path of bhakti-yoga, the process of being in direct service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied soul. The individual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult for him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore, the bhakti-yog\u012b accepts the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as worshipable because there is some bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course, worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be sagu\u1e47a and nirgu\u1e47a-of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes. Worship of the Deity in the temple is sagu\u1e47a worship, for the Lord is represented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented by material qualities such as stone, wood, or oil paint, is not actually material. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord.\n\nA crude example may be given here. We may find some mailboxes on the street, and if we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their destination without difficulty. But any old box, or an imitation, which we may find somewhere, which is not authorized by the post office, will not do the work. Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form, which is called arca-vigraha. This arca-vigraha is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord. God will accept service through that form. The Lord is omnipotent and all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as arca-vigraha, He can accept the services of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man in conditioned life.\n\nSo, for a devotee, there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme immediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way to spiritual realization, the path is difficult. They have to understand the unmanifested representation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as the Upani\u1e63ads, and they have to learn the language, understand the nonperceptual feelings, and they have to realize all these processes. This is not very easy for a common man. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, engaged in devotional service, simply by the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, simply by offering regulative obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord, and simply by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. There is no doubt that the impersonalists are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the personalist, without any risk, trouble, or difficulty, approaches the Supreme Personality directly. A similar passage appears in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. It is stated there that if one has to ultimately surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead (This surrendering process is called bhakti.), but instead takes the trouble to understand what is Brahman and what is not Brahman and spends his whole life in that way, the result is simply troublesome. Therefore it is advised here that one should not take up this troublesome path of self-realization because there is uncertainty in the ultimate result.\n\nA living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into the spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and knowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not realized. By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned in the process of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, may come to the point of bhakti-yoga, or devotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a source of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied soul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, both at the time of practice and at the time of realization. Every living soul is partially independant, and one should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the nature of his spiritual blissful self. One should not take up this process. For every individual living entity the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which entails full engagement in devotional service, is the best way. If one wants to ignore this devotional service, there is the danger of turning to atheism. Thus this process of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which is beyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, should never be encouraged at any time, especially in this age. It is not advised by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the difference between j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and bhakti-yoga ?

It is not real at all. It is an idea in your head. Nobody **knows** that idea except you. From this, you can already understand that this is literally completely personal and has nothing to do with reality. It might **seem** real because you **believe** it to be real, but that is merely because you do not know what you **actually are.**\n\nThe reason this seems so scary is because once you face your **self** (The actual self, not the one you **think** you are) you will understand all of this has been a lie, merely an idea, a thought in your head, has nothing to do with the actual you at all.\n\nWe all know we have to face it. This is your heart speaking, this is the truth starting to pour out because it can't contain itself any longer in this idea of a person who has anxiety, who takes everything personally, who is choosing fear over love.\n\nBecause of this, you are starting to burn up inside. All what you are not is starting to burn, and you realize you have to release it.\n\nYou are not afraid of releasing it, neither is the actual you afraid of what is going to happen.  \nThe only thing that is afraid, is the idea of that person itself. The idea is suffering from its own projections.\n\nSo, what is it afraid of exactly? well, it is afraid of ceasing to exist. What will happen after you release it, is that it won't exist anymore. It seemed to have existed this whole time, it really believed it did. To now release it and see it for what it is, means that sense of self that is identifying as a person will cease to exist. This means basically, it is a fear of death. It is not actual death, just an illusion though.\n\nThe person, the idea that conditioning seemed to have created, is afraid to die! It itself is projecting fear, trying to keep itself alive as much as possible because once you release it, it is over for the idea of who you think you are. So, understanding this, the actual you has absolutely nothing to fear, and only to gain the peace that you are.\n\nOnce you stop identifying as a person, once you overcome the person and transcend the person, you see what you are and what you always were and always will be, everlasting peace, spaciousness, spontaneity, truth itself. You might know it as \"Universal Consciousness\".\n\nNow, knowing all of this, you may proceed and release this person which is just a thought and totally not what you are, as you are the one observing this. You are the one observing all of this.\n\n5 years ago you were a person X, now you are a person Y, and in a year from now you will be a person C.\n\nThe person has changed, it is unstable, unreliable. What stayed though? The witness of all these persons that were created by the mind. You are the witness. You are never changing. You are aware of it all. Be aware of your self, the awareness of existence.

I think that the being writing this (insert name here), is using an electro bio-mechanical flesh vehicle with ten toes and ten fingers to communicate an odd concept. We are basically (hosting) our vessels. Vessels that don\u2019t just contain the soul/consciousness, but (with limitations) allow us to have motor functions: move, talk, breathes effortlessly. A higher state of being that allows us to conjure images and words into our minds at will, while still having that autonomous functionality of our vessel. \n\nWe are inhabiting not only the planet that we\u2019re on both the bodies that we assume. And these bodies indefinitely repopulate to appease volumes of awaiting populous. This level is well built. It\u2019s given us pleasure (pleasure is in most Dimensions), however this pleasure is sensual. It gives us a very physical, tactile approach to sensation, feeling and ecstasy. Like the orgasm. A perfect method to ensure a constant production of the human species. One of the most naturally occurring intense feelings we can experience, begets the birth of new life. It's a beautiful thing. \n\nWith us looking at this realm as a sensual one, in order to proceed onto the next in an orderly forward moving fashion, one must not get so wrapped up in the physical. It\u2019s a beautifully alluring thing to just solely be worried and excited by earthly desires. One must walk the balance. Taste the fruits of the human experience, but be sure not to overindulge or you may find yourself repeating history. The focus is optimal, but in order to focus you must see that there is something to focus on. And to see what is to be focused on, is to question your current state of affairs. Most people don\u2019t see outside of what is around them, distractions are everywhere and as long as you appease the masses and keep them fat and happy and drugged. What we\u2019re left with is a docile society, stunted from growth. \n\nWe have to come back into alignment. We have to open our eyes and our perceptions of the environment around us, and not just nature, but the social constructs we\u2019ve fooled ourselves into thinking is progressive towards a sustainable civilization. We have to elevate the mind and reestablish the connection between us all. \n\nI realize I\u2019ve jumped around a lot and it\u2019s very fragmented but hopefully some of you folks are able to comprehend my words. \n\nUntil next time- Apollo", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76852, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A Beacon of Light", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/egzgi7/a_beacon_of_light/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "VolcanicAa", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5bdm9c60", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577577472, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/egyezj/twin_flames_real_or_not/", "gildings": {}, "id": "egyezj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 23, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/egyezj/twin_flames_real_or_not/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577578160, "score": 1, "selftext": "would love to hear people\u2019s views on the Twin Flame dynamic. \n\ndo you believe this is a real concept?\nhave you experienced it?\ndo you think twin flames can be transcended at a certain level of consciousness (aren\u2019t we all One)?\n\ni have experienced what i believe is a Twin Flame dynamic. the fact that i question it could mean it was a false karmic imposter. who knows. \n\ni\u2019d rather keep this post peaceful and about your personal views. all viewpoints and opinions welcome \ud83d\udc96\nthought would be an interesting discussion and something i am both very interested &amp; very confused about \ud83c\udf44", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76842, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Twin Flames.

You will never be able to feel totally free within yourself if you don\u2019t love the worst parts of you.\n\nThat is false. You are currently loving the good parts of you (The ego loving its own appearing to be \"good\" qualities) and now the ego has come to the realization it must love its own appearing to be \"bad\" qualities too.\n\nThese \"bad\" and \"good\" qualities are not you at all, you simply identify them as you. You are the one aware of them.\n\nIf you can perceive your self to be these \"good\" and \"bad\" qualities, how can any of it be true and the quintessential nature of who you are? The perceiver can't be the things it perceives. The perceiver is the perceiver. It is not \"good\" or \"bad\" as everything is perceived by the perceiver. It is only the intellect interpreting reality to be \"bad\" or \"good\" based on your own thoughts and beliefs you were conditioned to believe are true. None of it is true.\n\nYou, the true you, have no worst parts. You do not have any good parts either. All these \"parts\" are just a projection of the mind, they have nothing to do with you, you are the neutral awareness aware of all of this, you are not merely a limited identity made up by your mind, and you are not merely a self-image nor are you merely qualities of what is appearing to be \"good\" or \"bad\". You are the neutral observer of all of this. You can't be what you observe.\n\n&gt;Learn to use your shadow to your advantage and only indulge it in a responsible way.\n\nObviously something the egoic-mind would say. He is claiming that you should use \"your\" shadow for \"your\" advantage, using \"judgement, greed, selfishness, hate, desire, attachments\" for your own advantage.  \nThat is the epitome of selfishness. How can you use these obviously negative attributes to your **own** advantage (meaning more selfishness)? How can you **indulge it in a responsible way**?  \nThere is no way to responsibly \"indulge\" in judgement, greed, selfishness, hate, desire, attachments. It is impossible. Responsibility is being aware that all of this is not you, and not daring to indulge in these lies.\n\n&gt;There is no state of being that is \u201cforbidden\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d, it\u2019s all divine. It\u2019s up to you on how you use it. Embrace every part of you\n\nThat is exactly what the egoic-mind wants you to think and believe. It wants you to think and believe that it is ok to be selfish, it is ok to be judgemental, it is ok to be greedy, it is ok to hate, as long as it used for \"your\" own advantage.  \nIt is only the egoic-mind programming **you, the true you** to its own liking. It is disguising it self as you, and you let it do whatever it wants. It is not true!

Energy flows from one state to another through us and to live the life that we want, we have to make sure we are transmitting the energy that servers us. Don't get me wrong, there is no such thing as good or bad energy, only us human puts lable behind them. \n\nAnyway I also talk about NoFap and semen retention if you guys are on that journey. \n\nOnce again it's my first video and I would love some feedback for me to improve.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76731, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My thoughts on energy vampirism and how it can affect your manifestations negatively.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/egpnim/my_thoughts_on_energy_vampirism_and_how_it_can/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "redditKeyy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4cycidz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577521248, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/egobpr/you_are_not_seeing_life_you_are_projecting_life/", "gildings": {}, "id": "egobpr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/egobpr/you_are_not_seeing_life_you_are_projecting_life/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577521249, "score": 1, "selftext": "You were conditioned to have certain thoughts, beliefs, emotions, sensations, imagination, desires, attachments.\n\nBecause of this, you \"see\" life through a limited perception of these believed concepts and ideas.\n\nIf you \"see\" life through these concepts and ideas, what are you actually seeing? You are seeing concepts and ideas.\n\nYou are not actually **seeing** life, you \"see\" what seems to be conditioned concepts and ideas.\n\nHow is it so that every single person can look at a car, and every single person will have a different opinion?\n\nWhich opinion is true? Whose projection is the realest? Well, the truth can't be an opinion.\n\nLife can't be a projection of the ideas and concepts you are attached to. If you would to use the basic intuitive sense of putting things together and seeing them for what they are, you would instantly recognize, that in fact, you see life through a projection of your conditioning.\n\nYou **must** recognize this and **understand** this, and not say \"ok, so what, we believe what we believe, and this is my reality!\"\n\nThis is just limiting your self and causing suffering for your self. Be honest for a moment, the egoic-mind can think whatever it wants to think but you should not take its thoughts as the truth. Because again, all these thoughts and beliefs are simply projections. You won't be able to actually **see** what I am typing right now if you were to use logic and the mind to fathom what I am saying. Wait a moment. Slow down.   \nDon't you want to be seeing clearly? Do you not want clarity, peace, joy, love, compassion to be natural?   \nIs there a reason to keep on believing we are not enough, that we need to achieve things in this life, that there is a purpose to life?   \nThe initial thoughts automatically generated by your conditioning would be: \"No, we must achieve things! We must progress! We must have evolution! We are doomed to suffer and we are destined to see life through this limited perspective.\"\n\nDo you really want to believe that though? I promise you it is not necessary to believe that. Just the fact that you are aware of these thoughts and beliefs, means there is something greater, something beyond these limiting thoughts and beliefs.\n\nLife was not destined to be seen through this limited perspective, we are not monkeys anymore, guys, please, try and see this clearly. Try and slow down for a moment and actually see with **awareness**. Not just thinking anymore. Thinking is something that the old generation of humans were doing. There is no need for that. Awareness is the higher intelligence, and that awareness is what you truly are. You are not mere thoughts that come and are perceived by you. You are the awareness it self.\n\nI know it might sound really out there, and that there is no way that all of what you thought and believed about the world is not true, but contemplate for a moment, are you really settling for the life you currently have? \n\nIs it not worth to live this life we have, extraordinarily, with clarity, with peace, with joy, with compassion, with love?\n\nYou already know these things, deep in your heart, your true being knows these things. I am not talking to what you think you are currently. I see every single one of you readers as the manifestation of joy, peace, love and compassion it self. I do not see you through the illusions of the mind. I do not see you as what you have been forced and conditioned to believe. You are way beyond that. You and I both know that this is the truth. We are limiting ourselves daily and because of these pre-conditioned beliefs we are not able to break out of it.\n\nWhat should we do about it? How do we get out of this cage? How do we live life truthfully?\n\nThe first thing is to CHOOSE to live this life. It means no matter what your mind, your thoughts, beliefs, sensations, emotions, ideas, concepts, imagination, desires and attachments says - Say \"**NO! I will not settle!\"**\n\nYou are worthy of a much greater, deeper sense of self, not just a limited thought and belief of what you are.\n\nYou are able to be the manifestation of the highest intelligence it self in this universe. The universe is not separate of you.   \nYou are not just a drop in the ocean, you are the whole ocean in a drop.\n\nAgain these things might seem out there, but this **is** what is outside of your conditioning. It is a bigger, clearer truth which is whole and complete, there is nothing to seek outside your self.\n\nYou must break all these generational conditioning that we have been carrying forever. Tell your self, seriously \"I am the last of my family name to hold this conditioning. I will break it free and will make a better life for all the next generations\"  \nDo you want your own children, grand-children to be filled with lies? Children and life it self is so pure, it is so innocent, it is so loving, peaceful, joyful and compassionate, and we are going to fill it with egoic-mind concepts?\n\nEnlightenment was also conditioned to believe it is something out of reach, something that is practically impossible, something only few individuals since the start of the universe have achieved. Question this belief!  \nYou are not other than these individuals, they simply were able to break free from their own conditioning.\n\nChrist, Krishna, Buddha and whatever enlightened person you are aware of, they all experienced life just like you. They were suffering, they had a lot of misconceptions, a lot of false knowledge and beliefs. But it is VERY possible to leave all of that behind, but you must **choose**. **Choose** **consciously** to not be better, but to embody the divinity of the universe.\n\nThe egoic-mind does not know such concepts as \"divinity\" and it will only say this is some crazy theoretical talk, but seriously! Do not believe such a limited mind, that is conditioned to think that there is no more innocence and beauty in this life!  \nBeauty and joy is not having a new smartphone, or even going out to nature, or doing different drugs, or having superficial interactions, or any other material thing you can find in the external reality.\n\nTrue beauty and joy are inside our hearts. It is our nature. It is not something to seek, it is something we are, the egoic-mind simply won't believe and accept this! Why? Because you already have set beliefs and you are not consciously letting go of them to see a greater, truthful reality. You take all the egoic-mind says, thoughts, believes and imagines to be true, without questioning anything. Is this the kind of life you want to lead? I **know you don't**.\n\nYou must see through these illusions of the egoic-mind which just wants you to stay in this cage and conditioning.\n\nWhy does it do this? Because the egoic-mind is a result of the identity you believe your self to be.   \nThis identity is insecure, anxious, greedy, judgemental, selfish. It will not let you see the truth because seeing the truth means to do or see something that might make the egoic-mind insecure, anxious. It will trigger the natural defense mechanism and will bombard you with thoughts and emotions to distract you from living a better, clearer life.\n\nYour nature is not to be insecure, to be anxious, to be greedy, to be judgemental.\n\nLook at children. Are they any of these things? No. They are conditioned, and grow up to be these things, because of the adults that forced these things on these children. Children won't know to embody love, joy, peace. It is their nature, but if their parents, something they love more than they are aware of themselves, tell them to be a certain way, it is not that they won't listen to the parents. They will stop listening to themselves. Do not let this happen.   \n\n\nSeriously life is so, so beautiful, so precious, so joyful, so peaceful, so divine, it is just that you can't **see** it because you **think and believe it already to be something else**. If you look at something while already believing it to be a certain way, you will never see what it truly is.   \n\n\nWhat do we do with all of this information? Start being aware. Start consuming guidances from gurus and from enlightened people, and do not just interpret it how the mind thinks it is, actually try to see it with your own perception, without distorting anything. See it innocently.\n\nAwareness is the true currency of joy, love, happiness and compassion. Awareness is all you need.\n\nLook at your hand.\n\nYou are now aware of your hand.\n\nNow be aware of being aware.\n\nIf you were to stay in this state, if you were to be aware of being aware at all times, very, very quickly **all** of your thoughts, beliefs, concepts, ideas, identity, sensations, emotions, attachments and desire will **naturally fall away.**\n\nHow does this happen? Because instead of identifying with the thoughts that appear **in** awareness, you are aware of awareness it self. With making this a habit, you are literally conditioning your self from **everything** so that only true perception is left. Only awareness is left. **From this moment, your life will be bliss it self.**", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76716, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "You are not seeing life, you are projecting life with your own thoughts and beliefs you were conditioned to believe in", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/egobpr/you_are_not_seeing_life_you_are_projecting_life/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "happyhippopo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_57zt1jyn", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577521026, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/egoajs/finding_ppl_who_wanna_awaken/", "gildings": {}, "id": "egoajs", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/egoajs/finding_ppl_who_wanna_awaken/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577521027, "score": 1, "selftext": "If you wanna awaken or at least use spirituality to feel better from your depression/anxiety I'm here to help!

If I'm missing any better ones you can think of, please tell me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow can it be applied?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Earth, it's easy enough to apply virtues like courage, generosity, patience, determination, stuff like that, but how would you do that in the afterlife/spirit world/heaven/whatever you call it?  Many NDEs I've read describe people as feeling incredible love just by being there.  In a sense, it's described as a world where the natural laws are COMPLETELY different, almost a total inversion of Earth's.  By the principle of nondualism, virtue and vice are two sides of the same coin.  By describing the afterlife as a place where love is the natural state and everything is infinite and eternal, it pretty much perfectly absorbs all vices and therefore nullifies all virtues.  How can you be courageous if there are no threats?  How can you be generous if everyone has everything they need and/or want?  What do you need to be patient for if you can do pretty much whatever you want with a thought?  What's the point of learning love isn't as sweet without the pain if the afterlife is all love and no pain? (Please let me know if you have a different description of the afterlife.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoesn't this belief imply that the purpose of life is in the future?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlan Watts said that schooling systems tend to put of the purpose of life in the future: get to first grade, then get to middle school, then high school, then college, then get a job, then realize you've been cheated at 45 and probably have a mid-life crisis.  How is this any different?  If the intended lesson was to learn to live in the now, I don't think I'd have this problem, but I can't really see what could be so damn important that we'd go through thousands if not millions of lifetimes of pain and suffering to get it.  Some people say ascension, but ascend to what?  What could be better than the all-encompassing love described in NDEs?  And if the answer is godhood, then what will that god do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoesn't it invite a sort of cosmic victim blaming and evasion of responsibility?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you could prove this belief to be true beyond a reasonable doubt (and you'd need some good proof, considering the claim), you just made the perfect excuse for horrible things.  \"Being in lifelong poverty was in your life script, and triple homicide was in mine.\"  You can argue that we also have free will to mitigate evasion of responsibility, but depending on where the scale of free will vs. life script tilts, how do we know free will isn't sabotaged by the life script?  To claim responsibility is response-ability, you need the ability to respond.  You need the power to handle responsibility, and if the life script says you get screwed out of that power, how can you call yourself responsible, that is, able to respond with any real effectiveness?  Also, what counts as free will?  Only actions that hurt other people?  If so, why is free will so valuable then?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76711, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "About the belief that we choose our lives to learn lessons...", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ego499/about_the_belief_that_we_choose_our_lives_to/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "usernamealrdytakn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kaud2l2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577515521, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/egnic2/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_121314/", "gildings": {}, "id": "egnic2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Enlightenment"}], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/egnic2/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_121314/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577515522, "score": 1, "selftext": "***Hare Krishna.

A pure devotee is never disturbed in any circumstances. Nor is he envious of anyone. Nor does a devotee become his enemy's enemy; he thinks that one is acting as his enemy due to his own past misdeeds. Thus it is better to suffer than to protest. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatamit is stated: tat te 'nukamp\u0101\u1e41 su-sam\u012bk\u1e63yama\u1e47o. Whenever a devotee is in distress or has fallen into difficulty, he thinks that it is the Lord's mercy upon him. He thinks: \"Thanks to my past misdeeds I should suffer far, far greater than I am suffering now. So it is by the mercy of the Supreme Lord that I am not getting all the punishment I am due. I am just getting a little, by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\" Therefore he is always calm, quiet and patient, despite many distressful conditions. A devotee is also always kind to everyone, even to his enemy. Nirmama means that a devotee does not attach much importance to the peace and trouble pertaining to the body because he knows perfectly well that he is not the material body. He does not identify with the body; therefore he is freed from the conception of false ego and is equiposed both in happiness and distress. He is tolerant, and he is satisfied with whatever comes by the grace of the Supreme Lord. He does not endeavor much to achieve something with great difficulty; therefore he is always joyful. He is a completely perfect mystic because he is fixed in the instructions received from the spiritual master, and because his senses are controlled, he is determined. He is not swayed by false argument because no one can lead him from the fixed determination of devotional service. He is fully conscious that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the eternal Lord, so no one can disturb him. All his qualifications enable him to depend entirely on the Supreme Lord. Such a standard of devotional service is undoubtably very rare, but a devotee becomes situated in that stage by following the regulative principles of devotional service. Furthermore, the Lord says that such a devotee is very dear to Him, for the Lord is always pleased with all his activities in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n**Question 1 : How a pure devotee remains quiet and patient in distressful conditions ? What transcendental quality of a pure devotees does the word Nirmana represent ? How one can become situated in pure devotional service ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/egni0u/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_121314/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76699, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 12.13-14", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/egnic2/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_121314/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ohnoitsapril88", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2lk0a4g", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577512899, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/egn3kl/dark_night_of_the_soul/", "gildings": {}, "id": "egn3kl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/egn3kl/dark_night_of_the_soul/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577512900, "score": 1, "selftext": "What happens when it\u2019s over?

It has to be one of the hardest thing a person has to get through. I\u2019ve been trying to quit my addiction for the past 4 months but I had no luck I genuinely thought I managed to quit on my 1st attempt of semen retention with my 43 day streak. Ima be honest when I first heard of semen retention I started this journey to get at my crush this girl was my motivation I really had a thing for this girl and i can say I totally believe in nofap benefits because I experienced them from the confidence to talk to my crush to having hour long conversations with her and eventually asking her and and well I got rejected by her and it made me really sad and depressed killing my 43 day streak keep in mind I recently got over my toxic x I was really depressed still am but I was depressed asf cause I got rejected by my crush and went back to my old habits at this point in my life I felt so lost cause I knew this was a problem I\u2019m an 18 year old decent looking male with this porn addiction and no gf. After some time I realized semen retention wasn\u2019t abt the pussy and started again to try and quit but never got no near close to my old streak like getting at my crush motivated me more than getting my life together. It\u2019s December now and still no luck countless relapses I\u2019ve tried everything literally everything and nothing has worked for me I\u2019m really fucking depressed and I feel so lost in my life rn and I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore I stayed home alone on Christmas while my parents went out to my cousins house where our usual Christmas gathering takes place and I stayed home crying my eyes out alone cause of how fucking sick and sad my life is idk I accept It I guess I completely surrender to this like all I ever wanted was to have this beautiful long relationship with my crush like how I envisioned in my head and dreams holding her hand and wrapping my arms around her walking down the beach while the sun goes down but no I decided to beat my dick to two people fucking...

I have to admit that I have always had a problem with gossip and negative speaking / thinking, as well as being judgmental. I credit this to being a Capricorn, but there\u2019s no excuse. I don\u2019t know why I do it. When I am around other people, I\u2019m always critiquing them in my head. I get disappointed and irritated with people easily when they don\u2019t live up to my expectations and then I vent about them to other people. It\u2019s a dangerous and pitiful habit. I recognize it though, I\u2019m fully aware of it and I shame myself for it. I get caught up in the heat of my emotions, say negative things about people or situations, and then regret it later.\n\nWhat has helped you the most with this?

I\u2019ve been doing so much work on myself to heal from past trauma and it\u2019s been going well however, some triggers are manifesting itself in my workplace and I am 200% sure my therapist is over hearing about my workplace. My work life is currently 90-95% of my life as I spend my weekends in my room recovering/preparing for the week ahead. \n\nExamples:\n- I work in finance because initially I thought working in this industry would bring prestige and value to a life I thought was invaluable and without respect (backfired and only came to this realisation in therapy)\n- In my past and current role I\u2019ve observed my mangers have never invested any effort in me. I was a secondary thought (neglect and low sense of value manifesting itself from my childhood, particularly when another colleague was their \u201cdream\u201d, triggered by my childhood with my sibling being the perfect child)\n- Rude and passive aggressive colleagues. I\u2019ve observed that despite being kind in nature some people take advantage of this, are purposely rude despite my efforts to build a relationship/learn/work with them (childhood bullying triggered, never fitting in and feeling like I am not good enough) \n\n\nAnd so on. I left a toxic workplace after 4 years. I\u2019ve rejoined another place and 3 months in my experience has been a burner. The hours, some people and so on. I thought I was at peace with my past, the poor treatment from my last job and so on. Thus, I was not expecting this manifestation again. I spoke to my mentor and she believes maybe I am not cut out for the industry and should do some coaching to find out what my next move should be. For the most part I am relatively contained (emotionally). I am more reserved in nature but like 1-on-1 conversation. I am sitting in the dark just wondering what\u2019s going on. Maybe it\u2019s the wrong industry and God wants me to know? Maybe I\u2019m being triggered and it\u2019s clouding my judgment? \n\nI just find it crazy that I left a place after 4 years of mental torture to experience a milder version just 2-3 months in the job.

Most people never even think of the possibility that our thoughts may not be ours. But if it's not yours, then whose is it?\n\nThis question is an invitation to a deeper quest into the realms of consciousness. Those who wish to explore are welcome to read further. If you wish to stick to the belief that everything in you is yours then I suggest turning away at this point...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs thought a function of the mind? The ancient Egyptians believed that thought was a sense. If that is the case, then as with other senses, thought is simply a receptor for data. Except, unlike vision and sound, thought picks up information and translates it into something intelligible that our mind can interpret.\n\nThis does not mean that every thought is received from the outside. Especially nowadays, with many people suffering from overthinking caused by anxiety and stress, most of these types of thoughts are very likely generated by the brain of the person. But for those who meditate, or have dabbled in psychedelics, or the psychic and spiritual realms - doesn't it feel obvious to ask the question -  are we the owners of every thought that passes through our mind?\n\nIsn't there even the tiniest chance that the golden insights and strange other-worldly thoughts are coming from other realms and worlds that we may not have comprehended until now ?\n\nOf course if you are a scientist, your religion demands proof before you can believe anything. It is not my intention to try and prove anything here. This is simply an exploration of an idea that I have found to be highly intriguing. Based on my own exploration and research, many of our ideas and thoughts are more likely to be information from domains and realms in other parts of the universe. Unlike the idea of \"inventing\" things, we are very likely just picking up on information that exists in a parallel reality where that *invention* has perhaps always been a fact of life - like the internet for a millennial... or thought for humanity...\n\nIf you find this intriguing and would like to develop and tune your \"thought\" sense to explore the weirder side of reality, check out [The Infinite Zero Experience Center](https://theinfinitezero.com) and sign up to the mailing list...\n\nAlso check out /r/Comadism", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76662, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Not every thought that passes your mind belongs to you", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/egkw0k/not_every_thought_that_passes_your_mind_belongs/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "gribzydib", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_49a821f7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577500234, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/egkuke/close_minded_boyfriend/", "gildings": {}, "id": "egkuke", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 29, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/egkuke/close_minded_boyfriend/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577500235, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have become very spiritual after my medical ketamine iv treatment/ ego death, I\u2019ve read multiple books since then (it\u2019s been almost a year).

hosting life. I have felt this since I was a little child. My thoughts have always been that space is way too vast, and way to old to only have one planet hosting life.\nEven if we use the Drake Equation we end up with planets hosting life, why? Because of the fact that Earth hosts life (this we know, lol) the probability of life at least is not 0. Even if we use the tiniest fraction, when multiplied with the amount of galaxies and stars - we end up with a substanstial number of planets that in theory should host life.\n\nAnd later on I started researching online, convincing me yet more The facts are out there for anyone that wants to search for them. Human nuclear activity caused a massive surge in UFO sightings regarding anything nuclear. Obviously they don't want us to do something very dumb.\nWhat personally made me 100% convinced have been a couple of experiences with entitites on psychadelics. There are a lot of things going on that our normal state of conciousnes does not pick up. This is not a lone experience, there are very many that report similiar things. Our conciousness can do a lot more than we think, psychadelics show the miracles we are capable of doing with only our mind.\n\nOkay, so we are not alone - now then? \nAs it has been humanity has some times acted very aggresively against UFOs. First of all the humanity has to start with declaring PEACE. Furthermore humanity need to ask for assistance and intervention. No one will ever intervene if one does not ask for it. We have to actively ask if we want anyone to help us.\n\nThe first plan is to routinely hold global meditations where we reach out and ask for help. If enough hearts unite in a call of Peace and Love time and time again, it should go through.\n\nWhy do I want to do this? Because I love all beings in this world. I want everyone to be well. As it is greedy and violent human beings are hurting their own kind. This hurts my heart, a lot.\n\nBy making friends with our galactical elders we can enter an Age of Peace.

I have a story about the angel number 12:34, along with other signs the universe may have been throwing my way to go down the spiritual path associated with LOA. But to put things in perspective, I'm going to have to start from the beginning, this may be a long read but I will try to keep it as interesting as I can.\n\nFor the past year and longer, I was in the most beautiful relationship of my entire life. I'm a 25 year old guy who's had many relationships but this woman, I fell in love with at a level at which losing her was simply not an option. Things were beautiful, till something inside of me began to fester and take over. I started becoming very anxious, fearful and needy. Basically, I became the polar opposite of how I was before the relationship started and I could not, for the life of me, figure out what was wrong with me. She's an absolute dear for putting up with it all this time but then she needed space from me because she's had a lot on her plate as well. This is when my lowest vibration emotions possessed me and made me doubt her, which hurt her and we broke up. \n\nAt first I had no idea why this was happening, I thought we were perfect and in love and none of this made sense to me. But after being alone, it all came together. I was struck with the realization of what I was becoming and what I had done with the intensity of a freight train travelling at bullet train speeds. I didn't know when I stopped being the man she fell in love with. But I had to find out. We met after this, had a very nice time and I told her that I realized that we did, in fact, need time apart. Me, more than her. This meeting brought things up to a more pleasant note, the love was definitely still there. But, understandably, she remained distant and I stopped reaching out to her as well, as a show of me honouring her need for space. But more importantly, to work on myself in the meantime. There's way too much love and connection between us for her to not come back, but if and when she does come back, I have to be myself again. And then some.\n\nI skipped self-loathing and started reading all this stuff about relationship dynamics and stories from other people who went through similar situations and messed up like I did. I noticed a pattern; that it's when someone lets go of trying to get someone they love back, they actually do return. This stood out to me so I looked more into in and that's when I happened upon the law of vibrations and attraction. I read about people manifesting love into their lives through meditative practices. Now, I'm far from religious but I found a solid degree of faith through my psychedelic use over the years; I firmly believe that we are the universe experiencing itself and that everything, all energy, is connected. The entire universe is one consciousness and we're all very important parts of it. I have experienced this first hand, so I decided that I will better myself through guided meditations that will up my vibration in the universe. I have someone I love and I would like them back but I decided to trust the universe with that, since it's very apparent to me that I needed this. Of course, this doesn't mean I've given up. My intention going in, is to manifest her back in my life. But before that can happen, I understand that I must completely let go and focus on the one thing that is under my control - myself.\n\nI've been meditating, religiously, for almost a week now. The spiraling anxiety has calmed down. I am starting to feel like the universe had to remove what I had wrongfully made the center of my life, for me to recenter myself. I'm realizing that I manifest my fears. I had a fear of losing her, after having put her on a pedestal, and would you know it - we broke up. Never in my wildest day dreams did I think that was possible, considering the way we were with each other. But it happened because I manifested it through my fears. The reason I'm going forward with this spiritual dance with the law of attraction is because I also learned that through high-vibration emotions and self-affirmation, I can manifest all of my desires into my life as well. So that is what I'm doing now. I'm starting to feel whole and complete. My heart is starting to feel full of love instead of broken. This, was my spiritual awakening. Meditation has helped me revisit memories from my past where I was hurt and felt hopeless, embrace them, and replace them with positive affirmations. Turns out, the reason why I acted so insecure all of a sudden in my relationship was tied to old memories that I thought time had healed. Time makes you forget, it doesn't heal, guys.\n\nSince I've started meditation with the intention of becoming my best version, I've noticed some interesting things happening around me. Things that are a bit too real for me to write off as mere coincidences. I think that the universe is telling me something. On my second day of meditation, I was pacing around my house very anxiously and my grandmother approached me. I didn't tell her anything about my situation but she started telling me that with time, everything will be fine but if I lose the faith, then I may not go down the path I want right now. Later that night, I met a bloke outside of my gym who saw me smoking and sort of joined me. This was strange because I'm usually not approachable at all but this guy made conversation and it was very pleasant. He picked up on the fact that I was troubled and he just started giving me the same affirmations that I've been trying to hammer into my subconscious through guided meditation. He told me that sometimes us men go a little overboard with our love in relationships and it can make us feel weak and low value, and that as long as I focus of myself and find my worth, everything will be a-okay again. I did *not* tell him that I was going through a break up. On top of that, my old boss hit me up and asked if I was up for writing for him again, if he offered me a better pay. (I quit after he refused to give me a raise, I was very bummed out about having to do so and this was one of the many things triggering the anxiety that blew up my relationship with my love and friends.) My faith in LOA went up because of this. \n\nThe aforementioned 'signs' from the universe are definitely keeping me going, but today I found out about another sign that motivated me to write this post. Ever since she pulled away from me, leaving me in anxiety and confusion, I started noticing the number 1234 a lot. For example, I would check my phone and see no message from her but then see that the time is 12:34. This would amuse me each time and it happened for 3-4 weeks. Which is the entire duration of this difficult time of mine. Today, I looked it up, out of curiosity. It turns out that this number, that I had been seeing this entire time was the universe telling me to take this as a chance to fix myself once and for all. The universe was telling me that it'll all be okay this whole time. I was shook, but it just about confimed that I needed to keep going. I needed to learn exactly what I've been trying to learn and that it will manifest my desires. And once that happens, I just have to keep going - continue being connected with my higher self.

How silly that is? Worry about you. If you really want to help others stop trying to tell people how you think it is and live how it is. Work on yourself not other people. We already have enough people who think they know everything and can help anyone with mere words. I am student of the Universe that is always learning how can I ever know it all? They say the Universe is infinite yet we are content limiting ourselves and saying I have figured it out when really what have you figured out? Why limit my mind to the ideas and beliefs of other people when we have a body right here to experiment with! Instead we pollute our minds with other people\u2019s ideas and say I know how it is let me guide you, you suffering soul you. Downvote me I don\u2019t even care. I see too much of that throughout these subs. These people who think they know something more than others that they are in a position to guide other people? Unbelievable and I see so many people willing to just accept all these ideas bc it sounds so nice or is beautifully worded. Think for yourself friends we have a mind for a reason. And here\u2019s a quote from Ram Dass for all those people who re trying to \u201chelp others\u201d. Your intentions are great, I mean it,but I feel we need less talk and more examples. We already have enough talk we need examples of what it is to be that and live that Truth that the great souls to have tread this earth say resides in us. Why stop there and say I believe it why not find out for ourselves. Anyways here\u2019s the quote: \n\n\u201cThe suffering that comes from separateness is only relieved when you are present with another person. So the whole game of helping another human being becomes about realizing whether or not you\u2019re busy being the \u2018helper,\u2019 and making them the \u2018helpee.\u2019 If so, you\u2019ve just created suffering.\u201d\n\nIt seems these people want to help others but how can we help when we are still blind. Just because you have knowledge doesn\u2019t mean you are enlightened know that. If we want to live in a different world we have to go beyond the thinking mind yet we stay within the mind trying to explain all these far out things and share them in the hope it will help another. We get comfortable with certain ideas that we hold as a clutch, we don\u2019t let go of them, and they\u2019re preventing us from going beyond that which is known. But all of what I say could be nonsense too I have to consider that so don\u2019t listen to me or anyone else but yourself and see what is really up with life. We are trying to revolt against and go beyond the body mind complex by staying within the body mind complex? Another teacher once said it\u2019s like trying to escape prison but all you\u2019re doing is refining within the prison walls perhaps making it a little more adaptable and comfortable for you but you are still within the prison. We want real freedom, freedom from beliefs, freedom into the unknown. The more i tread my path truthfully not by doing what they the scriptures tell\nme to do. I realize I only do it because I wan to be like those great souls I\u2019m not content being myself and accepting myself where I am. The more you are true to yourself, the more I accept myself for where I am, and try to understand truth the more I intuitively feel I\u2019m after something very very real.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76580, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Stop imposing/forcing your beliefs on other people", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/egf2si/stop_imposingforcing_your_beliefs_on_other_people/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "blogmoneymedia", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3ylmoz0f", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577471169, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/egerhf/101_lifechanging_loa_affirmations_my_law_of/", "gildings": {}, "id": "egerhf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/egerhf/101_lifechanging_loa_affirmations_my_law_of/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "gSbao_4qRrPjw_RUbBZnA5d4TANGpA5tv_xaloFeFoU", "resolutions": [{"height": 68, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_CP7PbjulPcNzKVxjNiWrAXx28HsZDeeKXpm-M9mr_w.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88594f0c432ee9d8a559ecee6aee592e40d68e90", "width": 108}, {"height": 137, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_CP7PbjulPcNzKVxjNiWrAXx28HsZDeeKXpm-M9mr_w.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86e542a2c69ffa5475085d407315033ca0561dea", "width": 216}, {"height": 203, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_CP7PbjulPcNzKVxjNiWrAXx28HsZDeeKXpm-M9mr_w.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8c4bc217991576931db759f8790d80bf17e34e0", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 254, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_CP7PbjulPcNzKVxjNiWrAXx28HsZDeeKXpm-M9mr_w.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d97799fd03bba596f77a746ce85e0f593c2c04c2", "width": 400}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1577471171, "score": 1, "selftext": " The law of attraction is real.

You do not exist at all. You are projecting your own beliefs and thoughts on your self.\n\nEven what you think and believe about your self is just a projection of just that, thoughts and beliefs.

We will be Starting Bhagavad-gita Verse by Verse exercise again from 13th Feb 2020.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My understanding.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service. He explicitly explains this in this verse so unauthorized commentators, who try to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by the speculative process, will know that they are simply wasting their time. No one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or how He came from parents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed form. It is clearly stated here that no one can see Him. Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic literature in so many ways. There are so many rules and regulations, and if one at all wants to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance with those principles. As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who are engaged in His devotional service to spread the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a philosophy or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness throughout the world. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a benediction to humanity. Lord Caitanya was appreciated by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b as the most munificent man of charity because love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. And if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is always some statue, usually of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), that is a chance to progress. For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is very essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature.\n\nOne who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the spiritual master can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by revelation. For one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The word tu is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be used, can be recommended, or can be successful in understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nThe personal forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are completely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna. The four-handed form is N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, and the two-handed form is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; they are eternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is temporary. The very word sudurdar\u015bam, meaning difficult to see, suggests that no one saw that universal form. It also suggests that amongst the devotees there was no necessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the request of Arjuna because in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form.\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and then to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that the four-handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the original two-handed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the origin of all emanations. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is distinct even from these forms, not to speak of the impersonal conception. As far as the four-handed forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (which is known as Mah\u0101-Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord. Therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is eternity, bliss and knowledge. He is the source of all forms of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and He is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\nIn the Vedic literature it is stated that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person. His name is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He sometimes descends on this earth. Similarly, in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam there is a description of all kinds of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and there it is said that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not an incarnation of God but is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam. Similarly, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says, matta\u1e25 parataram n\u0101ny\u0101t: \"There is nothing superior to My form as the Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\" He also says elsewhere in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, aham \u0101dir hi dev\u0101n\u0101m: \"I am the or\n\nigin of all the demigods.\" And after understanding Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Arjuna also confirms this in the following words: para\u1e41 brahma para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma pavitra\u1e41 parama\u1e41 bhav\u0101n: \"I now fully understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of everything.\" Therefore the universal form which K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed to Arjuna is not the original form of God. The original is the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a form. The universal form, with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw the attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God's original form.\n\nThe universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with the Lord in different transcendental relationships. The Supreme Godhead exchanges transcendental love in His original form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore to Arjuna, who was so intimately related with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in friendship, this form of the universal manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful. Arjuna, who is a constant companion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the universal form. This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service, the two-handed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the most dear.\n\n**Question 1 : What details about Lord Krishna's four-handed form and two-handed form are given in this verse ? How are these forms different from the Universal form of Lord Krishna ?**\n\n**Question 2 : Why lord Caitanya was appreciated by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b as the most munificent man of charity ?**\n\n**Question 3 : How one can attain success in understanding Lord Krishna ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/eg8bbs/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1154/)",

True enjoyment comes from the Self. The Self, Brahman, absolute reality is true enjoyment. It is enjoyment that you cannot ever find in this world. It is love and peace and happiness that only exists in the Self. It makes the enjoyment of this world kindergarten, in comparison. Therefore when you go to a movie or you say you enjoyed it, you say it's a beautiful day you say that you enjoy the day, it is your ego that enjoys these things.*\n\n*Yet the reason I say to not to keep thinking about these things is because it changes, as you very well know. As an example of this is when it's a beautiful sunny day everyone is happy. When there is a storm and there is rain, most people become upset. They would like it to be sunny all of the time. When you received a lollipop when you were a little boy or a little girl it made you happy. When the lollipop was finished you became sad. And so it is when you grow up. You enjoy your job. You get fired you become upset.*\n\n*You enjoy your family then there is a death, a divorce, sickness and you can't understand what happened and you become miserable. And it can go on and on but you know what I'm talking about. But when you turn within, to the Self, to Brahman, to sat-chit-ananda, to absolute reality, to effortless choice-less pure awareness that is the power that never stops. It is the ineffable joy that I speak about all the time that you really are. It has absolutely nothing to do with conditions. It can rain or the sun can shine. There can be death, there can be life. There can be human happiness. There can be human sadness.*\n\n*This will no longer upset you for you have risen. You have become that which is always real, which can never change. Therefore do not put all of your mental thought into this world. For this world will always change. Rather learn to go within. Learn to dive deep within into that Self which is changeless. That is ultimate oneness. That knows absolutely nothing about sickness, depression, the world, but is a pure light of the heart, the absolute reality. You can make that choice. You have the freedom to make that choice. Everything else is preordained. Everything else is karmic. You have no other choices.*\n\n~**Robert Adams,** ***T133: All The World Loves A Lie***", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76479, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "True Happiness is Permanent in the Self, While Human Happiness is Unreal and Impermanent and Always Changing With Unhappiness", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eg7aln/true_happiness_is_permanent_in_the_self_while/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bipibopi", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_30jrql4u", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577426126, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eg77xu/really_weird_sleep_paralysis_and_some_questions/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eg77xu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eg77xu/really_weird_sleep_paralysis_and_some_questions/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577426127, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello all, I hope all is well!\n\nA few days ago, after a long night of staying up reading, I went to bed at around 3:30 AM (I've heard that this might mark some significance? the number 3 as well as 3-4 AM is considered the witching hour?

All your beliefs are PERSONAL? All your ideas, concepts, identity, imagination, everything is PERSONAL.\n\nYour whole existence you believe your self to be personal. Something irrelevant happens and you say \"this always happens to **me**\" or \"Why do they always treat **me** like this?\" or \"**I** always have these thoughts, I hate God!\"\n\nEvery single thing you believe to somehow relate to you. Because you believe you are individual, you are extremely selfish. You try to take care of your self all the time, fearing life and others, because you can't accept your own self as the universe. You were conditioned to believe you are an individual which needs to have certain things, that you are thinking in this way, that you must have certain beliefs, that you must know some concepts and ideas in order to operate in the world. The truth is, you were taught these things by people who literally have no idea who they are and what they are doing in the universe.\n\nYou were taught and raised by people who **think** they are individuals. Obviously you were born as a whole, you were life, but you were conditioned to believe you are individual. You got an individual name, everyone in society treated you as individual, and you simply started believing you are individual. That is not true. Even now, you are life it self. You are the universe it self experiencing the universe. There is no individual identity, it is a lie, an illusion. It is all an idea made up by your head. It has nothing to do with reality. It is all one big thought construct, that you believed your self to be. Well, it is not true.\n\nThere is this identity which you currently believe your self to be.\n\nThere is an awareness of this identity that you believe your self to be, otherwise you wouldn't be able to say \"I am this person\", you would not be aware of your identity.\n\nSo there is an awareness of the identity, but even of this awareness you are aware, otherwise you wouldn't be able to say \"Yes, that is correct, this is the identity I believe my self to be, and I am aware of that\".\n\nSo, not only are you aware of the identity, you are aware of the awareness it self.   \nWhen you realize this, recognize this in your direct experience (You can try it right now) you will realize that you never were in the first place. It was just an idea in your head. It never had any reality, you just believed it to be true. \n\nYou are the witness of the awareness it self. Close your eyes, you see a black screen.\n\nThat black screen is awareness with no light, and you are not that awareness. You are the perceiver of even that awareness. You are the witness of the awareness it self. The truth is you have nothing to do with this world. You, the true you, was never born, you can never die in fact because you never were born. Because of this, you can't suffer either, because only an identity can suffer. Only who you think you are can suffer, but you are not that, as you are aware even of the awareness of that identity, the identity can't possibly be you. That is seen easily.\n\nOnce you realize this, recognize this in your direct experience, you will be able to see through all thoughts, all beliefs, all illusions and say \"This is not me\" because ANYTHING you perceive, can't be you, the perceiver. That is the truth and even a child can understand this. Nothing to think, nothing to imagine, nothing to conceptualize, nothing to complicate, it is a simple direct experience TRUTH and KNOWING. \n\nBeing aware of being aware is enlightenment. Currently you are aware of the identity, but you never questioned your self what you truly are, you never asked the question \"Who am I\" and searched, you always perceived a thought by the mind and immediately believed it without questioning it. Because of that you never were able to be aware of being aware.   \nBeing aware of being aware is the ultimate reality of this existence. It is enlightenment. It is waking up from the dream. If you were to stay aware of being aware, naturally, automatically everything that is not you would slowly disappear into nothingness, until nothing is left except you, the witness of the awareness, the only truth. Everything else is a thought, belief, concept, emotion, sensation, all coming and going phenomena, anything that comes and goes can't possibly be you, as you are the one aware of these things coming and going. You can't be one of the coming and going phenomena. You are beyond change, you are the unchanging witness of life it self. You are life it self experiencing life. There is only life. \"other\" people only **think** they are individual, because they were conditioned to believe that. But it simply is false, you can EASILY see this.\n\nMost are too attached to the ego and are slaves to the ego, that is why you see everything that is wrong with the world. They think they are separate and therefore they go and hurt others, not understanding that others are in fact them selves, as there are no others, only the one true self, which is life. \n\nIf all people were aware of being aware, we would all be treating others kindly, compassionately, lovingly, peacefully and joyfully, as the only truth is that we are all one, and we do not hurt ourselves. It is only when the mind comes and thinks \"I am a separate individual\" that all the bullshit appears to exist. It is not true. It is only a thought. You mustn't believe it. Overcome this stupid mind that keeps you from being your true self. You are beyond the mind. \n\nThe mind can't exist without you, consciousness, life, but you, life, can exist without the mind. Realize what you are, recognize it for your self and be your self.\n\nYou can't change the world but the only thing you can change is your self. You can be aware of being aware, and just that will completely change the world, as the presence of one aware presence is stronger and more influential on the whole universe than a thousand unconscious beings which are caught up and are being slaved by the ego, believing they have no power, believing they are depressed, anxious, judgemental, greedy, and believe that others are others instead of treating everyone as they would treat themselves.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76438, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Because you think you are an individual, true love is not present.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eg5jih/because_you_think_you_are_an_individual_true_love/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lovehaswon777", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_xnyab", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577413280, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eg4vrg/archangel_gabriels_daily_message_thursday/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eg4vrg", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eg4vrg/archangel_gabriels_daily_message_thursday/", "pinned": false, "removed_by_category": "reddit", "retrieved_on": 1577413281, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76426, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Archangel Gabriel\u2019s DAILY MESSAGE ~ THURSDAY DECEMBER 26, 2019", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eg4vrg/archangel_gabriels_daily_message_thursday/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "redditKeyy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4cycidz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577410849, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eg4exf/why_you_cant_stop_thinking_the_true_nature_of/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eg4exf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eg4exf/why_you_cant_stop_thinking_the_true_nature_of/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577410852, "score": 1, "selftext": " \n\n&gt;Am I here because I\u2019m supposed to be?\n\nYes, but who are you referring to as \"I\"? You are the universe. You are life it self. You are not individual of this life.\n\n&gt;Why do my thought seem so different then everyone I surround myself with why do I think that I\u2019m going to be something yet I haven\u2019t progressed in life at all why can\u2019t I stop thinking about death and how we ignore it all the time what if everything I been through was to show me that I am something or why don\u2019t I follow people why do I want to be with a the leader there\u2019s so many things this universe is doing that I wish I knew the answers to I just wish life could help me out and help me feel at peace.\n\nThoughts are not something we generate. Thoughts are something that appear to be in the awareness that we are witnessing.\n\nYou currently identify your self as thoughts. Any thought you perceive, you say \"That is my thought. This is me. I am thinking this. This is what I want. The content in this thought is what I believe.\"  \nThis is false. Thoughts have no source, they appear in nothingness, and they disappear into nothingness.\n\nThoughts only appear to have power, and that they are real, that they are holding you only if you first believe that they are. Without your belief, thoughts are just thoughts. They come and going, completely irrelevant to you. They are nothing at all ultimately. You just believe this nothing to be something. You take the thoughts personally. You believe they are you. That is false.\n\nYou say \"Why can't I stop thinking about death\", well, first of all, it is not you thinking these thoughts. You are only perceiving them. If you are the one listening to the thoughts, how can you be the one making them? It is impossible. You are not the thoughts, you are merely perceiving them. Do not take these thoughts to be you. It is not true.\n\nYou are not thinking about death, but when a thought comes and its content is about death, you believe this thought to be you, you identify your self as this thought, and then you continue interacting with this thought. There is a stream of thoughts, and instead of being aware of your self, as the perceiver of the thoughts, you believe you are making these thoughts. Because of this belief, the thoughts never stop. Instead of being conscious, instead of existing and being aware of your self, you are instead feeding all your attention to these thoughts.\n\nYou can easily stop thinking just by being aware of the energy that is being emitted from your hands for example.\n\nYou see that thoughts do not stop? No problem. Shift attention to your hands. You will start feeling a slight tingling or energy that is perceived through the hands. Stay with that, Boom, you are already not thinking anything at all. The truth is you are not meant to focus on thoughts and believe them to have any importance, it is just what you have been conditioned to do. Everyone believes they are their thoughts, it is natural, it is a habit for you to also believe that. But do not continue to believe these things when you KNOW they are not you. That is ignorant. You are not ignorant.\n\nThe same about every other thought you have, none of them have anything to do with you. Drop them. Focus on reality. Actual reality, not the reality imagined by your thoughts. That is distorted reality. You couldn't even say it is reality at all. It is merely an illusion created by your mind and you believe it to be true. Just stop. It is simple.\n\nNext time you notice you are thinking too much, realize there is an awareness of the thoughts, otherwise you wouldn't know you are thinking. You would just be the thinking. Because thinking is tormenting you, you obviously are aware of these thoughts.\n\nNow, you know you are aware of these thoughts. The only thing left to do is to simply be aware of being aware. That is the ultimate meditation, that is the ultimate state of being, that is your natural state. If you rest in that, you are enlightened. Enlightened beings are simply aware of awareness. That is all. Nothing complicated about it. You can do it too. Anyone can do it. Most simply are not aware of how to be enlightened. They THINK, again, it is their mind, not true, that enlightenment is something to be achieved after hard work. That is false. It is only a thought preventing you from being enlightened.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76418, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why you can't stop thinking, The true nature of thoughts, Stay as your enlightened self", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eg4exf/why_you_cant_stop_thinking_the_true_nature_of/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "boililikoi", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_31d93twr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577410722, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eg4dz6/reikiyoga_bs/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eg4dz6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eg4dz6/reikiyoga_bs/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577410723, "score": 1, "selftext": "Who else feels the same way?

You are not the labels society tries time and time again to bind you to. You are not defined by how well your ability is to function according to the way society passively requires. Yes, choosing not to identify with or absorbing these labels will bring upon trivial dramas from the outside, some may feel directed personally at you. But you cannot let them get inside your head. You must only let them get to you on a very surface level and let it go. You must know deep down, you are the contents of your deepest hearts desires. You are the stillness of the silence, stripped free from all layers and illusions. You are the love and joy of being. You are the works of art you invision and create. You are the beauty found in a quiet forest. You are the powerful resilience that fights off all urge to let go of the end of the rope you've been gripping on so hard to for so long, so much so your skin is bleeding, knuckles white, hands numb. You may not have belonged in that specific moment in time, and that is completely ok. Now you know more of what experiences and what realities you wish to create and which ones will drain you of your essence. Right now you may be tired. It takes the courage of a thousand tries and rewiring the brain twice as much to invest your energy into finding an unconditional place of inner belonging. The energy these people/their opinions/those experiences steal from you is worth far far less than the amount of energy you will need to save for yourself to become yourself. To honor and respect yourself with gentle tender care and love in this moment is worth so much more than how much time is spent being engulfed in grieivng the personal power you have lost in the past.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76291, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "To anyone dealing with loneliness, feeling rejected or outcasted", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eftwlm/to_anyone_dealing_with_loneliness_feeling/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SeekersofUnity", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1je050y1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577353817, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eftn39/my_top_10_books_to_read_on_mysticism/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eftn39", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eftn39/my_top_10_books_to_read_on_mysticism/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "fLRHsslM8v1U3437le0LsAgOMpa-SarDleAaj2nF7CU", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GGB6_2LtsjrZ23yk5IG_XCnQy1GPS7jBih2wRyHAPTo.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=691ee1caee4593a798bf7e056a34f880b0e1799b", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GGB6_2LtsjrZ23yk5IG_XCnQy1GPS7jBih2wRyHAPTo.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3825d5afcb910170fbcf8a14a675d7987b49f978", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GGB6_2LtsjrZ23yk5IG_XCnQy1GPS7jBih2wRyHAPTo.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0346ec7b3e019bc1da2bb2ee3e3036fab391d40c", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GGB6_2LtsjrZ23yk5IG_XCnQy1GPS7jBih2wRyHAPTo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=ba56af4e08b292135b849ffefac457624b4f6213", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "removed_by_category": "moderator", "retrieved_on": 1577353819, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76287, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Top 10 Books to Read on Mysticism", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eftn39/my_top_10_books_to_read_on_mysticism/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "usernamealrdytakn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kaud2l2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577353763, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eftmuf/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1143/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eftmuf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Enlightenment"}], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eftmuf/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1143/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577353764, "score": 1, "selftext": "***Hare Krishna. We will be Starting Bhagavad-gita Verse by Verse exercise again from 13th Feb 2020.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**You are the father of this complete cosmic manifestation, the worshipable chief, the spiritual master. No one is equal to You, nor can anyone be one with You. Within the three worlds, You are immeasurable.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worshipable as a father is worshipable for his son. He is the spiritual master because He originally gave the Vedic instructions to Brahm\u0101, and presently He is also instructing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to Arjuna; therefore He is the original spiritual master, and any bona fide spiritual master at the present moment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic succession stemming from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without being a representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot become a teacher or spiritual master of transcendental subject matter.\n\nThe Lord is being paid obeisances in all respects. He is of immeasurable greatness. No one can be greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because no one is equal to or higher than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within any manifestation, spiritual or material. Everyone is below Him. No one can excel Him.\n\nThe Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has senses and a body like the ordinary man, but for Him there is no difference between His senses, body, mind and Himself. Foolish persons who do not know Him perfectly say that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is different from His soul, mind, heart and everything else. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is absolute; therefore His activities and potencies are supreme. It is also stated that He does not have senses like ours. He can perform all sensual activities; therefore His senses are neither imperfect nor limited. No one can be greater than Him, no one can be equal to Him, and everyone is lower than Him.\n\nWhoever knows His transcendental body, activities and perfection, after quitting his body, returns to Him and doesn't come back again to this miserable world. Therefore one should know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's activities are different from others. The best policy is to follow the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; that will make one perfect. It is also stated that there is no one who is master of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; everyone is His servant. Only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is God, and everyone is servant. Everyone is complying with His order. There is no one who can deny His order. Everyone is acting according to His direction, being under His superintendence. As stated in the Brahm\u0101-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, He is the cause of all causes.\n\n**Question 1 : Why Arjuna is addressing Lord Krishna as spiritual master ? What are the characteristics of Lord Krishna's senses and activities ? Why it is important for one to understand them ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/eftmhf/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1143/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76287, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 11.43", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eftmuf/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1143/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "blogmoneymedia", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3ylmoz0f", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577351322, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eftbqf/healing_affirmations_crazy_healing_story/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eftbqf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eftbqf/healing_affirmations_crazy_healing_story/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577351322, "score": 1, "selftext": "Did you know that people have been using affirmations for self-healing for centuries?\n\nOur world is full of people who have used affirmations to heal their mind, body, and soul.\n\nWe become what we think.\n\nOur minds are way stronger than we realize.\n\n**Let me tell you a crazy story that I heard from a doctor\u2026**\n\nThere was this guy who had a brain tumor.\n\nHe remained happy no matter his condition and he was determined that the brain tumor would not kill him.\n\n**Every day when he woke up he visioned tiny sharks eating his brain tumor away.**\n\nDays turned into months and after a couple of months, when the doctors took pictures of his brain, they were positively **surprised**.\n\nThe brain tumor had shrunk by 50%!!!\n\nThe patient had decided that the brain tumor would not kill him.\n\nHe visioned and used mental affirmations to get rid of his brain tumor.\n\nIt was his determination, manifesting and strong will that made his **miraculous self-healing** possible.\n\nThe world is full of these kinds of true stories\u2026\n\nHealing affirmations are incredibly powerful if used right.\n\nIf you want to read my blog post that contains 101 powerful healing affirmations go here:  [https://perfectaffirmations.com/healing-affirmations/](https://perfectaffirmations.com/healing-affirmations/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76283, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Healing Affirmations &amp;

I\u2019ve also stopped practicing it (for example, I no longer have interest in spirituality related books/ blogs and stopped using spiritual tools like crystals and sage). I\u2019m not quite sure when this change occurred and I don\u2019t know why. Am I out of tune with my mind body and soul? I feel happy, but it\u2019s almost like something is missing in my life because I use to really value the connection I had with myself, others, and the Earth via Spirituality. Has anyone else ever felt turbulence in their spiritual journey? I know I will never lose what I have learned so far, but I don\u2019t want to feel disconnected. Some other useful information about my life is that I recently have healed from a very dark depression and have moved out of a place that made me feel stagnant and unhealthy, and I would expect these improvements in life to hold a greater space for enlightenment. I feel like I am no longer a hippy dippy little fairy child I once felt was my pure/ true self. Maybe my Spirituality will revive and I will start practicing it again but for now I am just silently riding the wave.

it's usually through music (or numbers).  i'll get a song that i haven't listened to in *years* suddenly pop in my head &amp; find that the lyrics reassure me in a way that nothing else really can. \n\ni have been really, really struggling with depersonalization/derealization for about the past 7 months. when i get in the worst throes if it, i can't feel anything except fear and dread - both usually brought on by existential thoughts that i'm not a real person, nothing matters, etc. etc. my thoughts feel out of control and i can't concentrate on anything. the harder i try to concentrate on things, the worse the feeling of \"i'm not real\"/\"i'm in a simulation\" feel. the last few days have been very rough. today i had a panic attack because my grandma rearranged our bathroom and i wasn't expecting it when i walked in to brush my teeth. it freaked me out so much that i felt like i was one of those circus playhouses with distorted wall/mirrors. the ceilings got taller, the room started to expand, &amp; the lights seemed to dim. scary, crazy stuff. wouldn't wish it on anyone. \n\nafter that, i was real close to just giving up and giving in to the thought that i'm losing my mind. i wanted to accept the thought that i am truly insane, incurable, &amp; alien. i don't necessarily mean contemplating suicide (although sometimes that happens), but more like i wanted to finally tell my mom what is going on with me &amp; how i feel/think, because i *know* she will send me to an in-patient psych ward. i sometimes feel as thought i'll never get better &amp; it will be easier to just give up on my friends, family, dreams, life, etc. and live the rest of my life in a hospital. \n\nbut then, a song by the jonas brothers (\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02) came into my head after i thought about giving up. the title is \"a little bit longer.\" it's about nick jonas's reaction to being diagnosed w diabetes at 18 years old or so. the lyrics talk about how there is no cure to his diagnosis &amp; how people don't know what they have until it's gone (happiness, peace of mine/body). but he just keeps telling himself, \"keep holding on just a little bit longer &amp; ill be fine.\" i started bawling because i had been trying to tell myself that, but it feels so different when it comes from an outer source. it may or may not have been from my spirit guide, but i'm not going to interpret it too much. i'm just thankful to have gotten the reassurance when i did because i desperately needed it. \n\ni often see a lot of posts about love and light and happiness and it all seems so easy. i've had those peak moments where i feel connected with myself, but it doesn't often last long. i'm unworking 20 years of trauma, anxiety, overthinking, etc. &amp; my brain/mind can be (&amp; usually is) my worst enemy. sometimes it can be disheartening to see that i'm not doing as well as everyone else seems to be here. i didn't mean to make this post so long, but if anyone is struggling with this journey, know that you are not alone. i've learned to just ask for guidance &amp; surrender. even in your darkest moments, you are not alone. today i was reminded of that. \ud83d\udc93 wishing you all the best. happy healing.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76262, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "struggles w mental health", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/efrtfd/struggles_w_mental_health/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "redditKeyy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4cycidz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577335638, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/efqz9j/you_are_eternal_you_are_not_able_to_die/", "gildings": {}, "id": "efqz9j", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 51, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/efqz9j/you_are_eternal_you_are_not_able_to_die/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577335640, "score": 1, "selftext": "You only believe that you can die because you currently are identifying with the body.\n\nThe body appeared to be born, and therefore you believe that it can die.  \nYou believe that you are this body, therefore you were born, and you can die.\n\nThis is all completely false.\n\nThere appears to be a body.\n\nThere is an awareness of the body.\n\nThen there is you, the witness of the awareness it self.\n\nCan something that was never born, die? \n\nCan something that is not a person, suffer?\n\nCan something that has no control over anything, do anything?\n\nYou are dreaming that you are in control of this life.

experience with one of my friends that made us both believe in the Bible. I used to believe that all that was bullshit trust me, I was getting all my information from New Age stuff, channelers like Bashar and Abraham, I used to take high doses of psychedelics to explore reality (inspired by McKenna and others of course), read occult books and anything of that sort that I could get my hands on. In my first 600ug trip I encountered certain entities that were stuck on people energy and at first I thought: this must be the persons own ego or some kind of energetic/astral parasites. But to my surprise this entities were very inteligent, had their own personalities and even spoke to me and teached me some crazy stuff. I always knew they have a bad impact on the person that was carrying them (I discovered that I had one two) and that they wanted the emotional energy of the person so I tried to discover more about this beings, studied them in other trips, speaked with them, read books that I could find on the topic and etc. I tried many ways to get rid of them but none worked till one day I saw a video of a Christian lady speaking about demons and how the name of Jesus cast them out. At first I thought it was funny but I had nothing to lose because I already tried so many things... So in one of my trips with a friend of mine who had a really big and nasty entitie attached to him I started praying in the name of Jesus Christ and the result was to say the least astonishing. We started to hear noises all around the house (we were alone at 2 a.m.) and what seemed like kids running in the hallway. The doors started to open and close by themselves, and the entitie took total control of my friends body and started speaking with me through him. I had soooo many trips man and on really high doses and that never ever happened to me or anyone I knew so I was really really scared. I never saw things moving by themselves so I was terrefied praying to God desperately for help. The entitie wasn't liking it at all and it was trowing demonic hex signs at me (I later seen the signs in witchcraft books) and insulting me. The look on my friends face was well... I can't even describe it. I never saw such a void and crazy look. I started feeling something crawling on my back and at that moment I was loosing it. I wanted to leave but was really scared for my friend because all his muscules sounded when he was moving and I was terrified that he could broke his neck. At one moment I started feeling hands touching my body and moving my clothes and that was the most scary thing I ever experienced in my life. I kept praying and at the end the sun started to rise and the entity left us alone. And from that moment we converted to Christ. I know what you might think but trust me I had more than 100 trips (some of them very powerfull) and everything went ok, but that time... I don't know, what do you think about this? Have you ever had a similar experiences? Ask me any questions if you have. I had some other trips after that one but the entities started to behave totally different after that trip and I didn't felt safe anymore and didn't considered taking psychedelics alone a good idea anymore. However I'm a very curious person so I tried to speak with them again and they told me that actually they were demons and they were fooling me all the time. They told me that Jesus Christ is real and is the only way to salvation but people are too lost and too engaged in the worldly things and love sin too much to repent and start listening to God. They told me that all the New Age movement is actually created by them as a way of making people get involved in the occult and esoteric doctrins that open the spiritual doors for them to enter your life. It's all disgused as peace and love but in reality is waaay more than that, you need to seriously investigate this because maybe it's all bullshit and I'm just crazy...  but if this is real we are in some serious trouble man. They told me that they are even planning a false alien invasion so profecies of the Bible can come true (they told me aliens don't exist, demons are sharpe shifters so they can disguise even as an angel). I'm a music artist and they told me that pursuing that dream would led me to perdition because the industry is controled by them as the majority of the things in this world. Seriously, I was freaking out with all this information and didn't really knew if to believe it or not. I asked them: isn't it stupid from your part giving me all this information? I could start telling people about this... but they responded: people are too centered in their own view of reality, they wouldn't even listen to you. Boy I'm still paranoid asf and don't really know what should I do with my life after all of that. I seriously hope this is all bullshit but maybe it is not. I just don't want to waste my life as it could have some serious repercusions. I know you think I'm crazy right know, but maybe being crazy is thinking that all this doesn't exist and that we don't need to worry about nothing, maybe that's the true meaning of leaving in a dream world because this reality seems wicked as hell man.

We know what happens if it gets too bad: You starve/die etc. We all inhabit this planet together(not by choice) and everyone has a consciousness and for leaders of the nations/species to treat their own kind like such is messed up and I\u2019m sure it hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by the universe. I think of the universe as the mother/the reason for our birth. How would she feel if she saw her sons and daughters treating eachother like this? How could you not have the best interest for another conscious being? \nThat being said, just as laws and abstract concepts are in effect simply because \u201cThey said-so and we know-so\u201d who\u2019s to say that as a planet &amp; from one existential being to another we couldn\u2019t make the world leaders make things right for humanity. We have minds and a consciousness just like them. They eat sleep and shit just as we do. I don\u2019t think we get money from the moon; we\u2019ve created it. What\u2019s so hard about making and distributing money to help every human on the planet and not leave them to wither away? \nPeople could eat, college wouldn\u2019t be as stressful for the students who are to shape and change the coming era, it\u2019s all around beneficial and wholesome. The only reason humans have made it this far is because when shit hit the fan everyone worked together to build eachother up and make sure they were okay. Why can\u2019t we just do that now?

They act like 6-year olds, and their response to being called one would probably be: \u201cYou let me.\u201d  Worse, given the fact that they\u2019re very good at superficial charm and emotional manipulation, they can convince you they\u2019re right.\n\nHow am I supposed to believe in the power of unconditional love when sociopaths have all but destroyed the world in the pursuit of power?

Hope you have had a great day so far.\n\nI\u2019d like to tell you just a smidge about me before answering. I have been very unhappy, basically just existing as blah (even worse than blah, some years of drinking and drugs, nothing horrible like on Intervention shows, but just not well and not healthy in body or mind). The last year has been dedicated to trying to understand how to grow, and the last month I am actually starting to get it.\n\nSo I am not wiser than you or better, the only thing I may be is more consistent. However, you can become more consistent immediately. So it is not so much where are we on our journey. I actually think that as long as we start talking with a consistent pace to the destination, we are all together immediately,\n\nTo your question, with things like apprehension, do I dig deeper. Two months ago I would have said yes, now I am not so sure. I wonder now is the reason my apprehension stays is only because I try so hard to explore it? What if my apprehension was actually trying to leave, let me go! And I keep saying No! You stay here with me, I have to understand you! You can just let me go though! No! I must know everything about you before I let you leave.\n\nWhen a house guest is over, as emotions our guests in our home, do you refuse to let them leave until you understand them and their history? Do you lock the door and say get comfy, we are gonna be here a while. And by the way we are both gonna hate all of this process. Or can we say hello apprehension! How are you today? I saw you yesterday, and I am seeing you today. Perhaps I will see you tomorrow, perhaps I won\u2019t. Maybe if I don\u2019t give you all my attention, you won\u2019t want to come back tomorrow. But if you do, I will welcome you back. \n\nAccepting does not need understanding. If you need to understand the people around them completely to accept them, you would accept no one. True or false? Because we can never completely understand. Even if we did understand, they will be different in 5 minutes.\n\nOr another way to think of it.... if you spend 20 minutes trying to understand why you were angry,if you had it just let yourself experience it and accept, you probably would have stopped being angry 10 minutes ago. All you are doing is thinking about the anger, not accepting it. So how can you let go of your obsession? By stopping to obsess. You can\u2019t even hide it, because if you hide without stopping your obsession, you\u2019ll just be obsessed about where it is hidden.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76163, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A quick perspective on Acceptance after asked about it from a new friend on Reddit", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/efl2wz/a_quick_perspective_on_acceptance_after_asked/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Roadsideromeo18", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1t907zt0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577303942, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/efkzxf/this_guy_is_giving_away_free_energy_healing/", "gildings": {}, "id": "efkzxf", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General"}], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/efkzxf/this_guy_is_giving_away_free_energy_healing/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "UuuH3o4lKs2eMB3XXDmBZgXPjb8QKtiqYJwK6yPVpw8", "resolutions": [{"height": 66, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/EF3BnL_a0UXyp4eHRi_v-FXM0oJvbZLWsS5ZSefLnYs.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cc3488604b2b3b8c5b8aec1fe39590b39c47e5a", "width": 108}, {"height": 133, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/EF3BnL_a0UXyp4eHRi_v-FXM0oJvbZLWsS5ZSefLnYs.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66c0dc63c4408b856826d7174c15ef60355b5e8d", "width": 216}, {"height": 197, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/EF3BnL_a0UXyp4eHRi_v-FXM0oJvbZLWsS5ZSefLnYs.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86c23bf3b210161b90b6bb1dda80d7564492fb4c", "width": 320}, {"height": 394, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/EF3BnL_a0UXyp4eHRi_v-FXM0oJvbZLWsS5ZSefLnYs.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32eaa3cfd3de92e5885ebacbbdbdd33cfab0a48e", "width": 640}], "source": {"height": 430, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/EF3BnL_a0UXyp4eHRi_v-FXM0oJvbZLWsS5ZSefLnYs.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=7549a18c0e9503e1ce30cad8f9a83e8ed5e085fb", "width": 698}, "variants": {}}]}, "removed_by_category": "reddit", "retrieved_on": 1577303944, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76162, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "this guy is giving away free energy healing bracelet on fb if anyone as try it tell me ?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/efkzxf/this_guy_is_giving_away_free_energy_healing/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "momknowsbest64", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_w0kmg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577303540, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/efkx1v/why_i_forgave_the_man_responsible_for_my_sons/", "gildings": {}, "id": "efkx1v", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/efkx1v/why_i_forgave_the_man_responsible_for_my_sons/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577303542, "score": 1, "selftext": " Christmas day.. \n\nTough day for me. Tough time of year \u2013 tough time to work up to. Last month around this time I was working up to the speech in memory of my son. Another emotional build up but there is always something that those of us that are grieving are working on, towards, away from. We are building up the strength to handle their birthday, the day they died, another family celebration without our loved one and now today, Christmas, officially my 3rd without him but I\u2019d really consider this my first as it\u2019s the first year I put up a tree. The first year I wrapped presents for my other son, the first year I had no presents under the tree for the son who passed away. It\u2019s hard\u2026 every day is hard\u2026 but these days are especially hard and working up to them only remind you of what you don\u2019t have. You aren\u2019t shopping for two anymore, you aren\u2019t wrapping for two anymore (and of course trying to make it evenly distributed between the boys), You aren\u2019t stuffing stockings for 2\u2026. The house seems some much less joyous.\n\nI am/well was a Christmas-a-holic so for me, to not have put up the tree was significant, but I did this year for my living son. I have to admit the tree looked beautiful and it was nice to feel a bit of the Christmas spirit, but it wasn\u2019t the same. It isn\u2019t the same. There remains a huge void I my heart. A year ago today I made a post on that I was looking for my son\u2019s heart and was on a quest to find my son\u2019s heart (and I found him thanks to so many kind people and have sent a wonderful year connected to this amazing man I am lucky to have gotten to know ) but today is a much different day with a much different feeling. While I grieve and will continue to miss my son for the rest of my life, I have been on quite a spiritual journey these last 6-8 months and have found myself led towards a desire to better myself in ways more grounded in things I can\u2019t describe. Trying to think kinder thoughts, trying to speak only with love and leading more with my heart. I\u2019ve been reading books on becoming more spiritually aware, (The Power of Now, The Untethered Soul, Being your Higher Self, Awakening Your Life\u2019s Purpose) because I feel there has to be more to this life than to work, eat sleep and being a slave to my grief. I must find the meaning of everything that has happened to me and in particular what I am supposed to do with all this love I still have inside for my son. How and where I am to channel this. I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019ve been going about this all wrong. \n\nAs someone who grew up in the catholic church and who\u2019s children attended catholic school I must say I am/was a terrible catholic. Sometime around my early 20\u2019s  I stopped going and certainly by the time I got married I didn\u2019t believe I needed to have a connection to any form of religion to have a connection with God and I certainly didn\u2019t believe some people were higher in their connection than me. The catholic church is all about hierarchy and being closer to God (priests, cardinals archbishops) \u2013 they are higher ranking in the system and therefore at least in my eyes were closer to God\u2026. How is it that I wasn\u2019t closer and how is it that God \u2013 my God \u2013 would have let something so tragic happen to me and my family. Being in grief groups you are surrounded by angry people who are struggling to accept their loss and certainly that whatever is good in any higher power really exists. I had quite the opposite experience. I knew (or at least thought) He didn\u2019t exist \u2013 before the death of my son because, to be honest, I felt nothing. When my son died, my son had become more spiritually aware and while I\u2019m thankful he had \u2013 I felt nothing. After he died however so much started to change and I started to feel very different and I began to feel the need to seek out more information about what was happening to me and felt as if I was guided to grow. \n\nI was guided to start Yoga and calm my mind/soul. I was guided to begin Reike treatments and started to read books about energy healing and I started to feel more as though I thought my son was in a higher place and that there was something bigger at play than just me and my thoughts and my grief.\n\nI realize I\u2019m a bit all over the place with this but bear with me. When my son first overdosed I had his phone. I had his unlock key and I was able to see who texted him and who he texted. I know who dealt my son the lethal dose of Fentanyl and that night I handed that phone over the police as we sat in the hospital waiting room while my son was on life support. \u201cHERE IS MY SON\u2019S KILLER!!!, CALL HIM AND ARREST HIM!!\u201d. I knew w he was in my son\u2019s phone as Jimmy G. Through my sons friends I was able to determine who he was (No his real name isn\u2019t Jimmy and to protect him I won\u2019t reveal his real name, or his last name but I eventually found out who he was) and to be honest, I wanted him to be found. At first by the police, but when the police didn\u2019t work/move fast enough I didn\u2019t care how he was ratted out, or by whom, I just wanted him to pay for my son\u2019s death. I also wanted the man who got my son into drugs to also pay and I regretted sending him some terrible messages over the following weeks that I wish he suffered for my son\u2019s passing as well (he didn\u2019t come to the funeral \u2013 I\u2019m sure he knew how I felt about him) . That person let\u2019s just call him \u201cW\u201d for now remains addicted to heroin. As time moved on, the police never arrested Jimmy and I wanted so much to out him. I knew his name, had his phone number \u2013 had his Instagram account (as he was \u201cfriends\u201d with my son\u2019s Instagram) had all the evidence I needed to convict him (or so I thought) but my brother is a police officer and he told me, you can\u2019t prove even if he was the one who answered the text that it was him that dropped off the drugs to my son. You can\u2019t prove that he \u201cknew\u201d that there was no heroin in the drugs that my son thought he received that night. \n\nMy son was meticulous about being safe. He took his scale out. We know by the text message he asked for .5g which was his \u201cnormal order\u201d and he had .4 left in his pocket so he measured .1 grams of the stuff and we assumed snorted it and then came outside to have a cigarette. Let\u2019s than 15 minutes later my son would be vital signs absent  on the back deck. What was in that drug that .1 gram of substance given to my son was 0 heroin and **4 times a lethal dose of fentanyl**.\n\nAs weeks turned to months and months to a year Jimmy changed his phone number- Sometimes I would call it, blocking my number of course and found out his phone was no longer active. Through messaging however, I managed to get his newer number and gave that number to the police but the trail had gone cold and no one was looking for my son\u2019s killer anymore. I often wonder how many other died that night or overdosed. \n\nDid he know the drugs were laced? \n\nDid he do it on purpose?\n\nDid he find out my son died because of it? (How could he not, all the kids know each other)\n\nHow does he live with himself now?\n\nHow does he live knowing he killed someone in the name of making a few bucks\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s enough to have to deal with. Perhaps knowing you were cause of the death of someone else is your cross to bear. I would have to think any reasonable human being would have a hard time living with that and I tend to think that most people are decent human beings and that\u2019s when my feelings began to change about him.\n\nI didn\u2019t need to see him suffer anymore. I didn\u2019t need to make him pay for the death of my son, he\u2019s already paying. He already must live with the knowledge that his actions took the life of someone else and living with that for the rest of his life is probably a larger burden than anyone would want.\n\nHolding onto my anger is equally a larger burden than I want to carry. I don\u2019t want to stay angry at him or hold out the hope that he will pay. Karma will be his destiny and I time, his life will be testament to his decisions. At some point, he will have to accountable, even IF ONLY TO HIS OWN MORAL COMPASS \u2013 and he too will answer to some higher power for his actions.\n\nSo\u2026 I forgive him. Not for him, but for me. I forgive him this Christmas day \u2013 to release myself of the pain of being angry, and the energy it takes to hold onto that anger. I forgive \u201cW\u201d too for introducing my son into heroin and if I could I would tell them face to face.\n\nLife is already too hard without the need for anger and it\u2019s much better with love and peace on this day. I spent a year trying to find my purpose and I think as we move into 2020 I will continue to seek out that journey but now I won\u2019t be seeded in any place of hatred or anger towards the man who was responsible for my son\u2019s death.  I will continue to read and evolve into my higher self - and find my purpose.\n\nI see now he\u2019s a real estate agent in my town. I guess he\u2019s trying to turn his life around. I guess that\u2019s a good thing, but for me, I can move forward with a clear conscience and a loving soul.   \n \n\nWishing you all peaceful Christmas this day, full of kindness towards each other.

I still feel that I am struggling and need to find a way to harness the focus again to rebuild that blissful state I used to be in daily.\n\nSometimes it feels like I go through phases and then fall back into old habits as if I'm only allowed to get a small taste of bliss every once in a while.  \n\n\nPersonally I don't know what I can do but I would love to hear from others who may have gone through the same or similar situations. I need guidance.  \n\n\nThank You.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76131, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Lack of motivation", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/efhwzo/lack_of_motivation/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "818throwaway818", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_57oozzkw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577288807, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/efhwub/wondering_if_anyone_knows_about_this/", "gildings": {}, "id": "efhwub", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/efhwub/wondering_if_anyone_knows_about_this/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577288808, "score": 1, "selftext": "I remember a book I was reading about alchemy mentioning Angel summoning, and \"divine magic\".

I believe that each of us is born with an inherent understanding of the nature of life, and it remains no matter how cluttered our minds get with our ideas about life.

It\u2019s interesting to hear about certain \u201cgods\u201d or spiritual elements from natives whose families have had a foothold in the region for many generations.  If you have ever been to the four corners region then you know just how desolate the area is.  Without as many distractions the land can be heard a little more clearly (if one has an ear for it).  Love the land but be wary.  It won\u2019t always put your interests first.  Respect the land.  If you take something give something. ( i.e: food, money, pick up trash, appreciate, give something)\n\nI have seen some profound things on the reservation and surrounding mountains/desert.  This changed my once atheist mind.  Some say seeing is believing.  In order to \u201csee\u201d an individual must first come to terms with the fact that there are mysteries to life and death that may never be solved.  \n\nWhile tripping, dreaming, and dead ass sober I have both felt and seen some weird stuff.  Things that cannot possibly be real...but I have felt them, I have seen them.  If feeling and seeing isn\u2019t a reality then what is? \n\nI respect science.  I understand that it can explain a lot about the world.  But there are sciences yet to be discovered  and truths that will remain unsolved.  This has encouraged me to document my own ideas on life.\n\nBased on what I have experienced I believe that things revolve in a cycle.  Matter is recycled and reborn into new things.  The universe works in odd ways, constantly deceiving scientists with new phenomena.  I can\u2019t help but think that there is order to the madness.  A closed loop, a circle, death and life.  It\u2019s all happened before and it will all happen again.  I will never find the answer to my unknown question:  what is life? \n\nNo need to take my word for it.  I\u2019m no scientist.  Your truths are your own whatever they may be.  My ideas are no more \u201ccorrect\u201d than anybody else\u2019s.  It\u2019s important to remember to focus on the things we have in common as opposed to the contrary.

Anyway today I was bored and realized I hadn't cleansed my cards in a long while so I lit some sage in my front yard and proceeded to clean the cards with it and once i was done I put it out first by smudging and then i poured some water on it to make sure that it was dead (I know you're not supposed to but I have an extra bundle so I didn't think it would matter).  Anyway, cut to about 10 minutes later I'm looking up tarot spreads and card meanings (I'm still fairly new to that) and the smell of sage is overwhelming me and I readjust and look up from my laptop and see that my room is full of smoke and I get up to see the sage is burning much harder than when I had it lit and producing about 2-3 times more smoke than when I had lit it and it's burning almost perfectly even so I take it and run to my sink and let it thoroughly soak and for extra safety I put it in a shopping bag and tied it up but I am terrified now and don't know what to do.\n\nAny advice?

I recently created a video going over simple techniques that you can incorporate into your everyday lives to help reduce any anxiety or fear that you may be experiencing. With all the technology that we use and the radio waves floating around humans these days are often very un-grounded. By not spending enough time in nature and getting fresh air we are experiencing more anxiety and fear than ever before. As an energy healer this is by far the most common symptom that I find people are struggling with these days. However there are a few very simple techniques that you can incorporate into your daily life to help you with this.\n\nOne very simple and effective way is to start spending more time in nature. By being in nature you can ask nature to remove any fear or anxiety and ground you. Nature is a fantastic instrument that you can use whenever. The key for this is to ask nature to do this. The more you intend that nature is doing it the better its gonna work. Another easy and quick way is to sit with your back up against a tree and ask for the tree to ground you. Or you can just try and walk around barefoot. The less layers of material between your feet and the earth the easier it will be to feel the earth grounding you. That is why so many hippies walk around barefoot all the time.\n\nAnother quick and easy method to use is talking to archangels. I ask archangel Gabriel to ground me a few times each day. He has amazing touch and can quickly remove any anxiety or fear from your feet. Archangels are with us all the time. All we need to do is invoke them and their amazing healing abilities. \n\nCrystals are super powerful and can help with this. Personally I use hematite and black tourmaline and they are the two crystals that never leave my side. If they do I feel very strange and out of synch. Smokey quartz as well is a very powerful grounding crystal. If crystals are your thing I would highly suggest starting to work with grounding crystals to reduce your anxiety. \n\nSalt baths are amazing tools to use and can quickly remove any anxiety or fear. The key for salt baths is once again to intend for the salt to clear out your root chakras. All you have to do is ask for the salt to absorb all negative energy. As well, dont be cheap with the salt. You want the same consistency of the ocean so make sure to use more than less. If you want to juice up your baths even more and make them even more powerful you can use earthy essential oils such as spruce, pine or juniper to help assist with even more grounding. \n\nAnother tool that I use all the time is binural beats. I normally have them playing in the background every time that I am at home on my computer. Sometimes I even have them at a low volume where I can barely hear them in the background behind whatever Im watching. Look for binural beats to either reduce anxiety or ones designed to help heal your root chakra.\n\nFinally the biggest and easiest way to ground yourself is through grounding meditations or visualizations. I have a couple videos on my youtube account that walk you through some grounding visualizations. The most effective one that I have used is to visualize roots coming out the bottoms of your feet and going down inch by inch into the center of the earth. When they get to the center visualize them going out in every direction and wrapping around the core. Once you connect to the core feel the earth pulling out everything from you. If you are more of a visual learner I have all of this made into a video that you can watch. Just send me a PM and I can hook you up with the address.\n\nI hope these simple techniques can help reduce your anxiety and fears. Much love.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 76016,

If you're supposed to be married and have 25 children you will. If you're supposed to have 25 wives and have no children, you will, or husbands, or whatever you want. But it's so beautiful to realize that you are nobody and be able to sit in a chair and the whole universe is under your command. You are no longer a puppet being manipulated by the strings of life. You have realized the phoniness, the nonsense of everything. Everything has become nonsensical and you just rest in peace.*\n\n*Usually the term \"rest in peace\" means you're dead. You are dead. You are dead to the body. It's funny how you give the right terms to the wrong situations. You actually do rest in peace and you are dead to the body.*\n\n*You have no desire to go anywhere, or to do anything, to live any one place. Yet remember also it does not mean that you're going to stay, necessarily, in one place. Whatever has to happen will happen. You may find yourself going to Japan or to Timbuktu, or anywhere, but it has nothing to do with you. You are at peace. You have a quiet mind. It doesn't function. The mind has become the Self. You are free.*\n\n*But yet to others it appears as if you're acting because you appear normal and go through experiences like everybody else. But you realize the truth. You're doing absolutely nothing. The observer may see you working, chopping wood, drinking wine, building houses, yet you're doing nothing. This sounds strange. It sounds like a contradiction, but it's not really.*\n\n*When you discover you are the Self, remember the Self is all-pervading. Absolute reality is omnipresence. Therefore everything is taking place within you. All the so-called actions of the universe are taking place within you because you are self-contained consciousness. That's why there's nothing you can really do, as self-contained consciousness, for you occupy every space, every atom, every universe, and you permeate what appears to be creation. There's nowhere for you to go because there's no room. There's nothing else. There's no space. Space is only for the body, the mind. But when you discover that you're pure awareness there is no space. You encompass all in all. This is the reason why there's nowhere to go and there's nothing to do.*\n\n*It's like you're a gigantic screen that takes up the entire universe, it is the universe, that takes up all of space. Yet forms appear on the screen. The forms appear on the screen and there's a lot of space between them. The forms appear to be going places, doing things, working, being born and dying, but you are that eternal screen, unflinching, immovable, sat-chit-ananda, parabrahman, and the whole play of consciousness is taking place on the screen, all within yourself. There's no place for the screen to go because it already takes up all the space there is. The only movement there is, is in the images on the screen. But the screen itself has no room where to go, what to do. It just is as it is. That's the way it is. Your true nature is absolute reality, the screen.*\n\n*There's nothing you have to do when you understand that you are omnipresence. There's no room for karma, or for sins, or for anything else.*\n\n*The game is being played by the beings who are projected on the screen. They're going through karma because they have a lot of space. They can go through all kinds of things if there's space. They're going through different experiences of birth and death, of happy and sad, of healthy and sick, of poverty and riches. The images are going through these things. Then they die and they appear to be born again in different lives, and the game continues for ever.*\n\n*But you are consciousness, you are the screen, and you remain the same, always. There never was a time when you were different. There never will be a time when you change. Consciousness is consciousness. The Self is the Self. It has no manifestations, no attributes. It just is. That is your true nature.*\n\n~**Robert Adams,** ***Transcript 105-You Are No-thing-24th October, 1991***", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75975, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "You are the no thing that isn\u2019t doing anything.

Completely impersonal, divine nothingness/everythingness/unspeakable.\n\nEven though we are able to experience this directly, very simply actually, we are able to be enlightened.\n\nWhat is stopping us from living as this? Mistrust. We are not able to trust ourselves, our true selves. We are so deep in the habit of thinking with the mind, that although we experience this great freedom and truth, we go back to the mind because it says \"No, you can't live like this. How will you live life without me? I am necessary\" but these are all just thoughts that are being perceived as well.\n\nThe psychological-mind can't exist without you (emotions, thoughts, sensations) yet you can exist without the psychological-mind.\n\nWho is it that is greater? Who is it that depends on who?  \nThe answer is obviously. YOU, the witness of awareness in which mind arises, is much, much greater. Way beyond.\n\nThe way to live in this enlightened state, our true, natural state, is to completely surrender the mind. Have full trust that life (your self) will take care of life (your self). You are the universe it self, trust in the universe to take care of it self!\n\nSo your mind might be thinking \"Yea but how am I going to work? how am I going to interact with people with no mind?\"  \nThe answer is presence. You will actually be able to work and interact so much better, because instead of trying to be something you are not, you will just be your self. Being your self, being enlightened does not mean you sit still and do absolutely nothing. Life continues. You are simply now aware of your self. That is all.\n\nYou still are not able to trust life. Let us look at some examples like Jesus Christ, and Buddha. They were doing this exact thing I am telling you to do. Be aware of your self and trust.\n\nEven though they were presumably doing nothing, and only being aware of themselves, they had innumerable followers, and are still growing in popularity, all the while changing the world and existence of this universe completely.\n\nSo, how did they do this by just being aware of themselves? When you are aware of your self as the universe, the universe automatically does its thing through your vessel. You stop thinking, stop overanalyzing, stop taking things personally, and suddenly the impersonal Brahman is you. The impersonal Brahman lives this life now, and you can trust that The Universe, Brahman it self knows how to live much, much better than your limited consciousness as an ego.\n\nIt knows how to behave and knows everything there is to know at ANY MOMENT, something you only dream of ever being able to do. It knows SPONTANEOUSLY everything that is to be known, no thinking, no analyzing required. It simply knows and does.\n\nHow does it do that? How can I trust that this will actually work?\n\nThese are all questions coming from the mind, the answer is that the mind won't ever be able to fathom the workings of the universe.\n\nThere is no answer to be given to the mind when it asks \"How can I trust\" because this it self is an illusion. There is a thought arising in awareness saying \"How can I trust\" and you identify it as you, because a really strong fear is attached to it, you let go of your self, and identify as this thought out of habit.\n\nWhat if you simply continue witnessing the awareness? Paying no importance to thoughts, as all this time you were giving importance and identifying as thoughts, and look how much suffering it brought you. It brought you nothing but pain, suffering, judgement, greed, hate.\n\nLet go of this, be your self. You can't know the universe. You can only be it.\n\nA higher intelligence is operating at all times, and that higher intelligence is you. Simply drop all other labels, and know thy self.\n\nEnjoy existence, self.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75974, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How to live an enlightened life?

If anyone actually tried this, you understand immediately it is impossible to actually observe thoughts. You either are observing, or you are thinking.\n\nWhen a thought comes into perceiving, it is automatically observed. There is no need to observe the thought it self and \"follow\" it, it is actually impossible to do. Once you put your attention on \"Observing\" the thought gets stopped at its tracks.\n\nSo what does observing thoughts mean? Well actually this whole \"practice\" does not make sense at all and I do not know who put it this way, it was probably a misinterpretation.\n\nWhat you are supposed to do is to observe the observation of thoughts.\n\nYou are perceiving a thought. There is an awareness of this thought, otherwise you wouldn't know it existed. It would not register in consciousness, there would be nothing to perceive it.\n\nNow, be aware of the awareness it self, in which thoughts seem to be perceived. That is true meditation, you are not supposed to give any importance or significance or meaning to thoughts, or to follow in order to see what their roots are.\n\nThoughts are like clouds coming and going in the infinite sky. You are the witness of the thoughts, and they are completely random, they have nothing to do with you. There is nothing to do with them, any meaning to derive from them. They are completely impermanent and have nothing to do with your existence.\n\nThe problem is you were taking them seriously and believing that YOU are the one GENERATING them.\n\nThe truth is, thoughts come to nobody. They simply arise randomly in awareness, and you, the witness of awareness was identifying as this coming and going phenomena. You see how faulty this is now, don't you?\n\nSo thoughts come into awareness, and you are the witness of awareness.\n\nThe practice is to stay as the witness of awareness, not to identify as what is being perceived by awareness, not to identify as thoughts, emotions, sensations, these are all arising in awareness. You are not even awareness. You are the witness of awareness. You are completely beyond both.\n\nIn meditation you experience this. Or more truthfully there is no \"you\" to experience it.

But it mostly comes from a place of yin and yang balance.  Been reading a lot of Taoism and yin and yang are actual energies which are basically the heart(yin)and the head(yang).  The spirit and the ego.  The emotions and the actions.  Now anybody on a bit of a spiritual journey understands (innerstanding is yin, it\u2019s heart it\u2019s empathy it\u2019s within) what I mean but maybe not the exact terminology( wording is yang, exterior, projection, the boxes things are placed in).  Hope I\u2019m doing okay explaining so far.\nNow us spiritual cats that may be a little overwoke and look at the holidays as bullshit, we\u2019ve gotta go extreme yin and focus on the FEELINGS of the holiday.  Oh it\u2019s a time for family.  A time for being grateful.  A time for togetherness.  Notice how these require your heart and are all yin qualities.  That\u2019s great.  We\u2019re usually yin masters which is what makes us different than most people who haven\u2019t awakened their divine spark.  But can we have some balance????\nThe holidays themselves on the yang forefront of what they are specifically ACTION-wise, are feeding capitalism, a monopolistic structure that doesn\u2019t value people, slaughtering mass amounts of animals to be grateful over with our family and praising how divine others are instead of ourselves.  We each have a divine spark and any system that says to worship others is a low key slavery.  Maybe not even that low key.  And then New Years which says hey this year will be different as if we need to wait an entire 365 days to be born again when we have an opportunity every god damn day!  This is insane to me.  \nThe holidays are just dickbagging us around, making us act (yang) in ways that do not benefit us with the guise of being a fun family time (yin) and there is no balance in it!  It\u2019s a ruse!  We can feel all these feelings based on truths instead of these self sabotaging, draining lower vibrational piles of nonsense.  Even the mascots for holidays are mostly made up!  We keep acting in lies and filling this bullshit with our actual feelings.  \nWe can love each other based on the winter solstice and honor nature and the divine source and the universe which we are mini copies of.  We can give up these fake reasonings for our true essence.  Let\u2019s be as genuine with our yang as we are with our yin.  I think it\u2019s time.  We don\u2019t have to keep giving our pure genuine kindness and love and light to a system of lies.  It\u2019s draining us real life matrix style.   Thank you if you\u2019ve read this far.

Sorry in advance :(\n\nWell, I've had a lengthy history of eating disorders, self harm, etc. in regards to wanting control, specifically over my own body which started after I hit puberty at 10. I've been trying to work myself out of binge eating lately (unsuccessfully, might I add) and as a result have been an emotional wreck. \n\nThe past few weeks however I have been triggered in ways I've never experienced. I am the only female in my PE class (which I have been incredibly emotional in for no apparent reason) and my male teacher was unlocking the female locker room for me. He blocked my way into the locker room and concerned asked me how I was enjoying the class and if there was any way we could improve it for me. I know he's a nice guy and meant no harm but something about being blocked from that door and his tone of voice made me panic. \n\nLast night at the grocery store I smelled a candy which I haven't smelt in years, and instantly that same tight chest/neck panic set in. On my way home my car malfunctioned. I was pretty calm until I realized that I would have to pull into a Mormon church parking lot. While waiting for help that same panic set in, but so much worse in that PE class. It's the closest I've come to having a panic attack in 4 years. I was paranoid that one of the men would approach me. Once I was home I was suffering a lot of negative symptoms of that. Shakiness, wanting to binge/cut/restrict, not being able to cry when I obviously needed to.\n\nI have had a very bad view of the Mormon church. The men in particular scare the fuck out of me, there's something about the shirt/tie and demeanor. Whenever I would go to one for a funeral the smell of the church triggers this nasty feeling. I just want to crawl out of my skin when I'm in that environment.\n\nThen the repressed memories started to bubble up. I have done one inner child meditation session in the past and a variety of shadow work sessions, but never have I considered sexual harassment/assault. I remembered that I've always had a weird amount of knowledge/fascination with sexual assault starting around age 8 which was worsened during puberty. There was never an explanation for it. \n\nI then realized that my aunt used to take me to a Mormon church at 4/5 years old, the same age range my inner child was in my meditation. The candy we got when making Christmas cards at church was the same I had smelled. The panic set in, but I reminded myself that it was my identity panicking, not my higher consciousness, and I was able to continue. However, as soon as I recalled the face of a man I couldn't return to my higher consciousness anymore. It was too much.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think that either my spirit guides or my higher consciousness is starting to trigger these to the surface for me to deal with them. I have the feeling that if I don't deal with this as it comes I am going to have an episode of full remembrance, and that would mean an emotional or possibly psychotic breakdown. I really, really don't want that. I have been seeing 17, 69, 22, and 88 constantly over the past two days and have been seeing images/stories of Lilith as well. \n\nI don't know what to do. A therapist isn't an option and this is certainly something I can't discuss with my family. I have contact with my spiritual guides but that only does so much. I am starting to make connection with my higher consciousness but as soon as I return back to my identity it goes to shit again. I am worried that I can't handle this.\n\nAny help or advice is appreciated.

I've posted on this sub before about how I started seeing synchronization, repeating numbers, a monarch butterfly, etc. a few months ago (about mid-September). The universe is trying to tell me something and I think more and more everyday I'm seeing the answers.\n\nI have seemed to regain my consciousness and spirituality again naturally as I went through a tough time in my relationship in which I was betrayed. In a way I feel like it was supposed to happen to awaken me to what I truly deserve. I learned to love myself, and put myself first - to start manifesting what I truly deserve. \n\nEver since then I've become more positive and just letting the universe guide me - I have become more open to energy and attracting what I feel like are my soul tribe (is that a thing?). These past few months have been insane, in a good way! I see the signs everywhere, I met some new people that all share the same interests and happened to be spiritual as well. But one person in particular we just... clicked.\n\nIt's as if I've known him in another lifetime. We are like the same person and I've never met anyone like him. He's been around for months but somehow we connected recently and have become pretty close - as friends! He puts a lot of things in perspective - our minds work very well together, and he brings this childlike happiness into my soul. His energy is like a magnet and he says the same about me. I don't know what it is, but I'm glad to have met him. He has been an amazing friend and we seem to bring out the best in eachother. \n\nThings are a little difficult right now as I'm in a relationship which I have realized is toxic in the long run... I don't know what all of this is trying to tell me but I feel like I know the answer. I'm scared but excited. I know that what ever my decision in the end may be, I will be ok. I have a strong feeling that 2020 is going to be a beautiful year. I'm manifesting everything that I want! \n\nI just want to know, has anyone else experienced this? This is all so new to me and I would love to know what others have done in this situation.

I'm not as interested in making small talk. I like talking to people and don't mind small talk but I prefer to talk to people about I guess deeper subject matter like what's your purpose or who are you essentially? Generally topics about a deeper reality beneath trivial things like what job you want to get or how much money you want to make. It feels almost like I'm trying to see the deepest core of their being even though the person that I'm talking with probably isn't interested in talking about those things. It sometimes feels like small talk is a chore that I undertake to pave a way in dialogue to get to a deeper topic. I don't think of myself as more spiritual than anyone else or better in any way. I just like exploring deeper topics with people.
