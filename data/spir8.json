A mountain subdivision actually and I was walking outside with my dogs on their leashes. \n\nThat's when I saw a bright ball of light floating in the distant forest. It happened about 20 minutes ago and I am FREAKED out!!! I tried to think it was a helicopter, but helicopters don't float that low and they have lots of sound.\n\nPeople say this is a world wide phenomena, but I'm not sure.\nThis subdivision is not haunted. I've lived here for years. The only other strange happenning was when me and my dad were outside talking about the stars and the universe. We were talking and all of the sudden he spotted. (It wasn't hard to spot either) A trail of stars shooting through the sky. I was there and he pointed them out to me so I saw them. It was like something we have never seen before. It wasn't a comet either. They dissappeared as if fading behinf a static wall of stars. In other words they dissappeared right there in the sky.\n\nWith the ball of light thing, at the time, I was freaked out! Now I'm starting to believe that this might have been an angel. Also the ball of light was really bright and dissappeared. I have been seeing 2222 and 444 and 777. As well as combinations of 2s and 7s. I honestly did not truly believe that my angels were present, but now I think they might be. I get pretty skeptical with the numbers sometimes, but I haven't seen them in forever.\n\nThis might be a gift.

She\u2019s as owned as can be. Taylor Swift has to answer to more people than the Dominos app on a Friday night. She\u2019s just another cog in the machine being told what to do. The people that are behind most all of this, that probably started all of it, are the Rothschilds family of banking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(this paragraph I will describe certain tactics)\n\nAnd I mean\u2026 it\u2019s very elaborate, what goes on. As advanced and maybe efficient as high operation military procedures\u2026 and they implement artillery the military doesn\u2019t have in any bunker. First is a reconnaissance. They gather more information on you than you have of yourself. Then they lure you in. They hit you on the head with something major in the beginning that keeps you guessing and always in need of their assistance to understand, or to stop. They give you a reason to be isolated and cave inward. You know, they give you something special; something that\u2019s exotic and intriguing. It\u2019s a little difficult, but just enough so it\u2019s sexy and keeps you coming back. For instance, usually musicians will choose younger unestablished musicians, and so on. They give you a reason to feel connected, or a dirty little secret just between you and them. It\u2019s something you guys share, and can build trust with, and obviously the idea is that it will lead to somewhere. \u2026But of course it will only lead to your doom, or utter ruin, obviously. They breakdown your facilities and cut off your lifelines. This is the mental and emotional/psychological abuse phase. Without the victim really knowing or being able to totally grasp the situation, they scramble your brain, and put you in this hole where you feel so helpless and cut off from everyone and everything that all you know becomes filtered through that depression and that chaos. You don\u2019t know what to do, and there\u2019s no way out. And eventually you get to a point where that\u2019s what becomes your reality. It\u2019s a new normal where you don\u2019t know and can\u2019t truly realize what\u2019s going on, but are forced to get used to it. But hey, at least sometimes it\u2019s with Taylor Swift. She\u2019s a good person, and this is going somewhere, right\u2026 All done in very planned out steps too. They shift, corrupt, and change your culture. What\u2019s around you. And what you know of inside of you. Of course this is very difficult or impossible to recognize or take account of at the time. At this point you\u2019re dependent on them. They know, and understand, what you want and what you need at all times and they manipulate, prey upon, and abuse the daylights out of you with it. They invade and infiltrate everything. Everything. Everywhere you go, they go, and it\u2019s hard to understand that or explain it. But as it was told to me, if they\u2019re not literally spying on you that very second, they\u2019re in your head, they\u2019ve infiltrated your work, your environment, your surroundings, they utilize different operatives, someone or some thing is always around, they\u2019re always affecting you. Plus they\u2019re very dedicated. And they will stoop down to the pits of the earth to create social (or whatever else) situations that are unescapable and unlivable. You can challenge, protest, resist, fight, whatever, any way you contest it, or try to adapt or be more cautious, etc., is at best temporarily effective. They\u2019re always around, they always maintain the upper hand. And little by little they amplify the stakes, but everything on their terms and for their purpose. There\u2019s nothing, in reality, you can do that would be comprehensive enough to repair and rebuild everything; there\u2019s no turning back. Your life is different and you\u2019re stuck looking and wandering around realizing it and watching it happen, but can\u2019t actually go about \u201chandling it\u201d or really addressing it. It\u2019s torture. This is torture, sabotage, disgrace and destruction of Life that shouldn\u2019t happen to anyone. And it\u2019s not like you actually bought the ticket to this, but you\u2019re stuck with and you get to have the closest seat in the house to the ruining of your life. Try and enjoy! It\u2019s a forced dominant and subordinate relationship where the dominant gets everything, and the subordinate gets to duck if they can. And this is before it gets to be a little much, and \u201cweird.\u201d Obviously it always is, but by now you\u2019re well beyond the point of utter exhaustion. Then, at the appropriate time or whenever they\u2019re instructed to, they break your spirit. You\u2019re already polarized, torn, exhausted, bound, divided, disgraced, and depleted. They got you where they want and they have the in they need, in every way. After that, they proceed to do the same as they\u2019ve already done, but now on a more direct spiritual level, and they truly conquer your Life. Don\u2019t know how to explain this part that easily. I\u2019ve heard it described multiple different ways. This is the aim, and the end game though the entire time. The idea isn\u2019t to warp and destroy your mind, your body, your emotional well being, or the life you knew. It\u2019s to decimate, corrupt, and kill your soul. To syphon the energy and the Life source you get from Beyond. Some learn this phase of things mostly as they experience it I guess, or at least become aware when they can. But of course always mainly on their terms. You might think this could never happen to you, and hopefully the circumstances of your life could smooth some of the variables, but if they chose you, they chose you for a reason, and there\u2019s not much or anything these victims can do until it\u2019s all over for them, no matter what degree of capabilities they possess. They also never let you get a break. As it was before, this is constant abuse, constant torture, constant manipulation, just now it\u2019s spiritual and completely inexplicable. I mean unless you have the in with Billie Eilish, you have to be very careful trying to take a nap at this time. Hope\u2019s an interesting thing around this time as well. It always is, but it can become deadly here. Don\u2019t ever lose it though. Fun stuff! And after all that and everything, after learning how to meditate, take a yoga class, what chinging is, and everything else, they put you in a box. Eventually, they can literally take control of you. Having already been a guinea pig, a hamster, and a meal ticket, now you become their spiritual buffet, and life size and incredibly real looking remote controlled doll. Day in and day out you\u2019re truly fighting for pieces of your Life and of your self. Still conscious throughout it all, just now you\u2019re watching and feeling pieces of your soul be taken away. Instead of wondering what the next day at work is going to be like, or figuring the ways to allow your brain to recover, you wonder if they stole eternity from you, you wonder if you\u2019re damned not just for the rest of your life, but for the rest of time, the concept of recovery gets more focused to: Where\u2019s God? Rather than what is going on?, even though that\u2019s definitely still there, there\u2019s a shift to how can this actually happen. Also concurrent with all of this and everything else, you\u2019re still being made to suffer the most degrading, demoralizing, disgusting and disturbing social situations. And this is it, everyday. Everyday, this is your life. Never really knowing who, what, how, or why. Some days are better than others, but sooner or later, they do take everything from you. Everything you knew. Everything you were. Everything you were going to be. And everything you are. Until all signs of Life are gone and you\u2019re a ghost trapped in a shell made of skin, or a zombie. A lost confused drained broken corrupted beaten defeated lifeless controlled, zombie. You wind up dead, and worse, you\u2019re not even deceased. Your life is no longer your own, it\u2019s no longer from where it came from, and it no longer is. It\u2019s the most invasive, oppressive, skipping many many unpleasant adjectives ahead, just f\\*\\*ked up, soul killing thing there is. And this is just some of the iceberg. The depth to all of this is incalculable and impossible to describe. \u2026And also sometimes it\u2019s not even over after that\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis kind of thing, these kind of atrocities shouldn\u2019t be happening. And they wouldn\u2019t be if we didn\u2019t allow it. This world we inhabit deserves better. It\u2019s its natural right. We deserve better. Real live human beings deserve better than this. Freedom and abundance is our natural destiny, not slavery and ruin. Things should be, and obviously can be, better. Better music. Better \u201cstars.\u201d Better role models. Better values. Better morals. Better standards. Better people. A better way of Life. And more. More. MORE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve heard this word too much: Crisis. A constant state of crisis\u2026 Which by definition is a constant state of panic, worry, fear, and darkness. It seems all too common and familiar. It is not the natural state for human beings, and it is not at all what was intended for the world we live in. And as it always has been, it is only up to us to change who and what it is we turn to, when things are pleasant, and in times of need. And the same for that which we determine for our children. Whether you agree or not, there is not a word I can use to state it accurately enough, but it\u2019s beyond the realest, truest, and most factual of facts, that change is possible if desired, and that things could be better. A lot better. For everyone and everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhether you agree or not, know there is a spiritual war waged everyday for the hearts, minds, and souls of individuals. Everyday the battle wages on. For some it\u2019s worse than others. And in the end one route is more fulfilling and rewarding. If you can\u2019t speak to something, or about something, then it\u2019s probably not the truth. People seem to misconstrue why certain things are being done. Probably because of what they\u2019re told over and over again, mostly by a system that produces and ensures it. And we\u2019re left with kids worshiping \u201cthe universe,\u201d idolizing music that isn\u2019t actual music, and seeking convenience in everything including quality and character. This is a product of a system that rules with arrogance and provides with lies, and also creates scapegoats out of people that are actually trying to do what\u2019s most noble and brave. Some people make it easier than others to become that scapegoat, and then all the system needs to do especially now is turn on the television, or your phone, and crank out the programming. Only a system (like the central bank, the people that run it, and all that branches from it, and things that are even older than that) that rules with sheer arrogance and provides with constant lies would turn the individuals that come to fight it and truly give the power back to the people into a mockery. This is not intended to be a political piece or paragraph, and ultimately what I want to say is in your time of need, in your darkest hour, consider your heart. Don\u2019t overthink it. Your heart is your source of life, and the people willing to go to the extreme and through the depths \\_for you\\_ deserve at least better than being considered: less than. And it\u2019s a mistake not to consider, or consider too late, that the thing that resides in your heart, that fills it with love and joy and peace like no other, and the most amazing inspiration there ever could be isn\u2019t something that is just simply biological or inherent to you. I think it\u2019s Something that people don\u2019t consider enough, or Someone. And don\u2019t ever be mistaken that there aren\u2019t People and Things in place far beyond just this world, that love you tremendously and want the absolute best for you. And there is no other agenda than that. Don\u2019t let your heart be led to something that doesn\u2019t actually care about it, is completely self interested, that didn\u2019t create it, and that didn\u2019t give Everything for you to have it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s a small example in the big picture of things, but a significant enough microcosm to what is going on. And there isn\u2019t as much a real personal cost or eminent consequence to some as it is to others, but to say the least it is wrong to look to and turn to people who have been handed everything since they were a child, and are used to people groveling at their every move and being called a \u201cqueen,\u201d who were picked and groomed to be the face of a corporate monster, and who don\u2019t live and have no need whatsoever to live by merit and accountability, to look to them for nobility in leadership. What you see is not really what is. And that is how ass backwards this world and society has become. These are people that created a system to enable, minimize, and destroy. To destroy, steal, lessen, devalue, disgrace, and tarnish Life. That\u2019s it. People that take individuals, their dreams, their value, their Love, their Life, and create and supplement an environment meant to exasperate certain flaws and issues that they\u2019re going through at that time, break them down, use them, and ultimately consume everything. Again, done in the cheapest and most demoralizing ways possible. These are people and things that created and mastered, destruction, deconstruction, and annihilation. Nothing more. Taylor Swift wants to proclaim and represent matters of the heart\u2026 It\u2019s just not true. It\u2019s not real. What these people do, part of what they are great at, is manipulation and presentation. Including marketing, performing, and distributing. It\u2019s not real though. What you see is not what is. Nothing you see is real. It\u2019s not genuine, at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean what are we doing? If each and every person was lifted off and planted on their own island and had their own world, these kinds of mistakes wouldn\u2019t be made. There wouldn\u2019t be any murders, or lies, or theft, or competition, or grief, or whatever, but it also wouldn\u2019t be as interesting. There wouldn\u2019t be any potential for anything. There wouldn\u2019t be the love of others, there wouldn\u2019t be compassion, or unity, conversation, or humanity with anything other than basic survival necessities. There wouldn\u2019t be much. Seeing that we don\u2019t possess our own little individual worlds, there is interaction, and mistakes are made. Someone like Taylor Swift being the most \u201cfollowed\u201d person on social media is one of those mistakes. And though she\u2019s a premier performer, this kind of mistake to this extreme can only be so with a system that perpetuates and enables it. This is a very cultivated system at play. Hopefully people are too busy living their life to notice, or care. But we as a society have collectively turned to and for the most part put in place leaders and things that have no inherent value. No real quality. And at the core are as hollow as it gets. What they have is stuff. There\u2019s nothing wrong with stuff or being a materialist if you were born that way. But all is not material. And Life, centered around materialism is again, nothing, and cheap.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I guess if I didn\u2019t have any substance to myself or my life, I would want everything and as much as possible too. I would want to know the power an idea can have so I could use it to my advantage. I would want years and years of experience so I knew what I was doing down to every last detail. I would want cover, I would want a system in place that protects me and my interests at all times. I would want money, because why not, obviously, and I would want to be able to control every aspect of it. I would want as much authority as I can possibly have and I would do whatever I needed to to get it. I would want the entire earth, and all that\u2019s in it. I could possibly be wrong but maybe just so I could look back and laugh and be able to feel something at all. That\u2019s what\u2019s at work here. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. That\u2019s what\u2019s being \u201caccomplished.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImagine a world without compassion, without mercy and forgiveness, without altruism, without a helping hand, without softness, without a gentle touch, without heart, or anything pure at all, without everlasting peace, without character, without morals, without the greatest source of Love there is, everybody only in it for themselves, their self righteous entitled beliefs, and the biggest chunk of stuff they can get? I mean eventually down the road they\u2019re going to have to learn to laugh at themselves, because the meek, the noble, and the nice have all been eaten and consumed. This might sound exaggerative and maybe like I\u2019m getting ahead of myself, but I\u2019m also not. This kind of thing is happening today, right now. People, young people, of tremendous value, eager, able, and willing to make a worthy contribution are being swallowed up, pushed back, pushed down, tarnished, disregarded, buried or left to rot, every single day. And this is what we\u2019ve chosen. Just in case you didn\u2019t think about it, or you don\u2019t know it: A world like that, has to be run by something, things, and people that don\u2019t give the faintest crap about anything or anyone. It\u2019s not sustainable. And the only value a human could have is when they go along with it, and they are of assistance to big brother and the \u201cgreat\u201d machine. Good thing it\u2019s an incentivized pyramid scheme, because the most you\u2019ll ever really be is a pawn. Your \u201cgreatest\" destiny would be to own a nice car, if you\u2019re lucky and serving enough. A world like that, unless you, yourself, own every part of it, there is no hope. (no matter how many celebrity environmentalists there are) There is no future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything doesn\u2019t have to be the best. We tend to do that too much. Everything doesn\u2019t have to be the best, or the #greatest. Leave that on the stoops, lunch benches, and barber shops to pass the time. I\u2019ve talked about \u201cbetter\u201d a lot, but I know that\u2019s not for me to decide. I think it\u2019s better to be vulnerable and confident, rather than arrogant and dismissive. I\u2019ve always loved the nuance in things, the subtitles of life. I want to feel and truly experience as much as possible. I try to be as available and open as I can be to allow that to happen. At times, maybe too open and too available. And I had to learn this like most everybody, but you can\u2019t take for granted the things you think you know when you\u2019re young. This world has its way of beating people down. And I\u2019ve talked to a lot of people that weren\u2019t as lucky as I was. These days now I\u2019m certain everything really does happen for a reason. And it\u2019s not just some cute thing you put at the end of a book, and I\u2019m very lucky to know that. Call me crazy, but I love things like a good hug, or a real embrace. I love the little notes of beauty that are there everyday in Life, that are never ending, and provided in abundance. I love being able to see, feel, and experience little notes here and there, and more often than not those notes, those little hints of Life all come together in ways that I can\u2019t understand, in perfect harmony. That\u2019s my \u201cbetter.\u201d Let\u2019s not continue to build a world that is forged in usury and debauchery, everybody one upping each other and looking to be the best because they have to, leaving behind whatever that it might have been. That\u2019s not how it was designed, and isn\u2019t what is meant to be. That\u2019s mostly how a small group of people made it. This generation seems to have a desire to care. Allow it. Nurture it. Protect it. Let\u2019s show the world, more importantly, let\u2019s show each other what we\u2019re made of. And that is, always has been, and I believe always will be: Love. All we need to do is care enough to try. Try enough, and eventually it will happen. That\u2019s been promised. Just keep knocking. More than you could ever imagine will be opened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGod. God is everywhere and in everything. Not in three billion years did I ever think I\u2019d say anything like this, but God knows every hair on your head, every secret you\u2019ve had, every single thing you\u2019ve ever known or felt. God knew exactly who you were before your parents ever could have imagined. Heaven is a place where miracles happen more than every day, and they\u2019re miracles that are meant for you, that mean the world to you. And that\u2019s just a part of it. It\u2019s been said the world isn\u2019t worth your soul, because it\u2019s not. Your soul is worth more and is of more value than the world. Don\u2019t go giving it to somebody or something that doesn\u2019t care about it, that doesn\u2019t have a clue about, that wouldn\u2019t know what to do with it, that only wants it because he needs it. Another fact: satan, or if you\u2019re not willing to go there entirely, the rothschilds at least, have their hands and their pockets deep in most all facets of life. It became like that because they control the flow of money. From what I understand, and I'm not an economics professor, almost every major industry and institution on this planet is controlled in some way by them. Politics, entertainment, media, education, and others all carry their signature. And yet, from beyond the galaxies or wherever it is, God, Jesus Christ, and The Kingdom of Heaven is still, by far, the most powerful and profound thing on earth. What does that say about satan? I\u2019ll tell you: \u2026what a piss ant. And I haven\u2019t even gotten to the good part yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou should treat, and revere the Word of God like it is the Word of God. Nothing was until God spoke that Word. You are not if God didn\u2019t think of and love you enough to do that. And It is as powerful, as It is alive. When you talk to spiritual people at spiritual places and you bring up Christianity, immediately people say, \u201cToo many rules, too many rules, \u2026oh just more stuff I can and cannot do.\" People associate Christ too much with the Catholic church, and that\u2019s probably because the Catholic church is old and has the most money. It\u2019s not accurate though. The Catholic church and the Vatican, and plenty of its representatives took the guts and the spirit out of Jesus Christ. I\u2019m not an authority on this, you\u2019d have to ask a scholar or a historian, but I believe the Vatican and its leaders took out and hid a lot of the the teachings of Christ, and added a lot of stuff in order to make it more of a religion. Jesus doesn\u2019t care about your religion. Jesus didn\u2019t come here to establish religions. And I don\u2019t want to overstep or offend anybody I don\u2019t want to offend, but the religious institutions that are, whom proclaim to be centered in Christ, should stop bickering about mostly minuscule differences between this and that. Is that really what it\u2019s about? You think Jesus cares about that? Believe me, I\u2019m the most unlikely person to say this, but you\u2019re not giving Him enough credit. Jesus Christ is beyond all of that, and far more amazing. He\u2019s not wondering whether or not you\u2019re doing it exactly the way you\u2019re suppose to. Jesus Christ isn\u2019t oppressive. Do you think you master this world, life, and death by limiting or being limited? What Jesus brought forth were values. Do you think Jesus Christ doesn\u2019t want you to live your best, fullest, and most wonderful life you can have? That\u2019s the most absurd thing ever thought of, if you think about it. Jesus is the kind of Guy that would walk in front of a train for you, or worse. And why?? I\u2019m not going to go on about this, but let\u2019s at least get the basics right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish this world was a perfect world. I wish this world was more beautiful at times. I wish people were better to each other. I wish we could reach out and save all of the world\u2019s suffering. But it\u2019s not. They\u2019re not. And I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re meant to. We strive for progress. Who knows if we ever really see it. I\u2019d like to do my part. I\u2019d like to play a note, share a verse, and whatever will be, will be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn\u2019t want to get too far into the conspiracy theory weeds, but it\u2019s impossible not to. Like any job or project, there's always a lot more that goes on behind the scenes than whatever gets brought to the surface. In Jim Valvano\u2019s famous speech he said everyday: Try to cry; have your emotions be moved to tears. Try to laugh; live abundantly, enjoy company and love life. And try to spend some time in thought; be enthusiastic and enjoy the precious moments you have. Try. He said that was a great day. What I\u2019ve mentioned throughout this email are people and things that have the ability to truly strip, tarnish, and destroy all of this, even in a person who does each one of them to outstanding measures. To reach the top or toward the top of that kind of organization, or anything like it, know that there is a body trail, and a trail of souls as well. Lives and Life that has been left behind and vanished. Enough love from people willing to give it that could probably heal the entire planet have been stolen, lost, eaten, bled dry, and worse. Works, contributions, dreams, that would create and sustain value, that who knows what would be if given a chance, halted, torn, burnt, gone. All for nothing more than the benefit and pleasure of sick people that don\u2019t deserve it. These people, these organizations, have the orchestrated backing and support of all the corporations and media outlets they need, and plenty of other means as well. And they\u2019re very good at orchestration and cover-up. Doesn\u2019t mean that these things aren\u2019t happening. They are indeed. And now you know. Every single one of us human beings, we all have a journey. Most are very long, and very difficult. And that has never not been ok. But if we\u2019re all stuck as human beings living in this world, can we at least agree on two basic and hopefully universal desires: that we want our children to have the best lives they can, and that we want a better world for us to live in. To me there isn\u2019t much more we could hope for as a species that inhabits this place. But what are we investing in? What are we saying that matters? And why? Who are we turning to as a culture and calling our leaders and our role models? And again, why? Is it what is expected of us? Is it what we are choosing? Or do we just not know any better? Or all of the above? If the brain is the command center and all things run down from it, and all things go through and function by it, and the heart is the vessel which pumps and streams the nutrients necessary to the brain and the rest of the body to allow Life to happen, then might we call it true that Life actually starts in the heart and stems from there? The heart belongs to the brain as much as the brain is dependent on the heart. But it is in the heart where Life actually begins, and becomes. Therefore it is our upmost duty to protect and defend it by all means. And we\u2019ve done a pretty piss poor job of doing so. What is the heart of this world today? Is it a cell phone, or a hashtag? Does it even have one? And it needs to be something more than just a shape you make with your hands or a pasty on an album cover. \u2026Don\u2019t say the music either. It\u2019s not really even theirs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything truly does happen for a reason. Every single second, moment, thought, feeling, action, everything, is accounted for. And there is Something and Someone that has always actually had our back, and then there are these squirmy insolent disgusting little creatures that want everything for themselves. I can't tell you what to believe, and we can't say or determine what is real until we experience the things that lead us to adopt what becomes true for each of us. Even then, sometimes a rock can fall on our head and we can look up and think it\u2019s the wind. We all make mistakes. Life was not designed to be simple or easy, and that's why we're all gravitated toward that and those which seem to make it like that is how it actually is. But it\u2019s not, and it shouldn\u2019t be. Typically, and in some cases certainly, all they are, are incredibly arrogant liars. That\u2019s it. Some people make it their entire lives and devotion to provide as many as they can with a sense of strength, purpose, peace, humor, joy, and comfort. And then there are those that say, there\u2019s our mark, there\u2019s something we can use, there\u2019s dinner\u2026 in order so they can have something they\u2019re able to laugh at. It\u2019s not coincidence, or \u201cjust the way things go\u201d why our world, in every facet and stitch, except maybe cheap technology, is crumbling, being ripped, torn, divided, falling apart, and going to crap. It\u2019s nothing that\u2019s meant to be. It\u2019s a ploy, and a scheme. Designed by crap. Built by crap. And for\u2026 crap. Life isn\u2019t meant to be easy, or even easier. Life is meant to be great. Life is meant to be extraordinary. Life is infinite. And Life is perfect. That\u2019s the way It was designed, and intended. Why go sell it to anything, and hand it over to stuff that doesn\u2019t care at all? Life  today is already full of enough crap. Stop buying it. And it would be a mistake not to assure anyone that may not believe it: Anything and everything truly is possible. Let\u2019s be expansive. Let\u2019s let ourselves be more honest. Let\u2019s be trusting. Let\u2019s be better, to one another, and then some. Let\u2019s avoid constriction, restriction, destruction without any just cause. Let\u2019s avoid deceit and hubris. Let\u2019s avoid mediocrity. Let\u2019s not make this world into a container, or a death trap. It\u2019s certainly not suppose to be. This world needs to stop destroying itself. This world needs to be yanked, pulled, pushed, fought for, and driven back towards the things and the stuff that are actually really and truly beautiful, and above all else, LOVE. And for God\u2019s sake people, that Love needs to be real.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt has been my pleasure and honor to exercise my right to free speech, thank you very much.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75856, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Concerning Truth (part 2)", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eeyck5/concerning_truth_part_2/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lightandsea2", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5ahk7oij", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577173512, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eey8n5/concerning_truth_part_1/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eey8n5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eey8n5/concerning_truth_part_1/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577173512, "score": 1, "selftext": "To whom it may concern:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs countless amounts of people have before, our world, and life in general, have come to the crossroads. Though the path might have already been decided for us. This letter I am writing you today is not one out of spite or envy, nor hatred or condemnation, but mostly I am simply writing this letter with the intent to inform, and to ask for better. And to be clear as possible, I wish I wasn\u2019t doing this. Maybe in a different time, in a different place, things would be different. I almost feel like I\u2019m tearing down Santa Claus. Though, perhaps I\u2019d feel different, if there was some alternate universe which Santa Claus didn\u2019t only make toys and spread joy to the kids, but led a completely dubious and double life where he raped, abused, and murdered the kids, and ate their souls, as truly seems to be the case with the entity I am going to mention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat entity is Taylor Swift, and all is not how it is made out to be. It's actually way worse than that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerhaps all of Hollywood might be this way. Glitz, glam, red carpets, and galas for all to see. And behind closed doors, pedophilia, con artists, closet psychopaths, arrogance, hubris, outlandish narcissism, and dark sadistic cult-like rituals and traditions far more frightening and real than your most disturbed nightmares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy only question is who and how many are all complicit? I mean I guess we all are to some degree. We go along with it because they give us what we want\u2026 The 5th Avengers and a remake of every Disney film ever made, another synthesized beat box song we can dance to, and even one with a message to it. Of course that message isn\u2019t one that actually came from Taylor Swift, herself. Certainly not from her heart. Perhaps something or someone else\u2019s. When did we allow the world to fall into the hands of obliged and obligatory sycophantic disc jockeys and enablers who prop up these false idols? At what point behind this curtain we tend to call life, did we allow everything that is good and real to become perverted by popularity and a really intense sense of FOMO? All I\u2019m saying is things are not what they seem. Things are not what they seem, at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was younger, I used to always say \u201cAnything and everything is always possible. You have to believe in yourself.\u201d I guess also though if you want to make God laugh, tell Him your plans. And as it turns out, I guess that\u2019s the one thing I actually have learned in my life. The depths and wonders of our world are nothing short of infinite, beautiful, and miraculous. And they should be protected, and honored, and praised everyday, at all times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently the concern of priorities has poured into me like a wrecking ball. What is at the top of your list? Who is there and why? Sometimes we concern ourselves maybe a little too much with what it is we\u2019re doing. All things are poured into that notion; trying to advance, trying to build, trying to perfect, hell, sometimes just trying to figure shit out. We can exhaust our selves to oblivion if we allow it with what is going on. What is going on? What is going on? And more often than not, not enough emphasis on \u201cwhy?\u201d Why are we doing what we\u2019re doing. Or we find excuses around it, or a bird flies by, and we get back to whatever it was that we were doing. My intention with this is not to target Taylor Swift, or bring her down. That\u2019s not my game. And she\u2019s one of the most powerful and followed people in the world right now. I know this very well. And even when I started writing this, with the notion of my own personal priorities in mind, I wondered: why am I doing this. Why am I really doing this. Without hesitation or any further speculation, the answer always was because it\u2019s the right thing to do. I wouldn\u2019t be doing it if it wasn\u2019t absolutely necessary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTake a nickel and throw it on a chair and it\u2019ll probably find its way up some celebrity environmentalist\u2019s ass these days. All focus and attention now goes to what is the problem on the outside and how quick can we develop, advance and sell the technology to \u201cfix\u201d it. And after that, how can I take a selfie with it. Not really too much concern for what\u2019s inside it, and what it\u2019s made out of. All glory to the trending image, and complete and utter disregard for substance, or quality, or character. All pupils geared toward the show, and off to the leper colony with actual authenticity. It\u2019s never seemed more true, that all that matters, that all that we care about, mainly, is the packaging. Marketing, packaging, and distribution. And the entertainment industry was the first off the block with this, and is still where it is most prevalent. It doesn\u2019t sell art or anything that enhances a culture, as much as it sells flesh and desire, and cultural assimilation. Building and establishing a brand is the end goal. Regardless of personal inclinations toward the \u201cwork,\u201d the brand comes first, and the brand is what moves the product. And some of those brands are a total hoax. It\u2019s actually rather remarkable what is capable of being when the status quo is \u201cthis is how it\u2019s done.\u201d You can actually establish a brand initially based on things like love, kindness, and wholesomeness (and post to that effect) where the person at the front of it doesn\u2019t even have to have a real conscience or moral or ethical or honest bone in their body. As long as we keep tilting the scales toward the appeal of life and what and how much we can do with it, the more we will detract from the quality and integrity of life, and all that it can be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn less than two decades we\u2019ve already gone too far. And I\u2019m the first one to admit I\u2019ve been guilty of this as well. The first time I ever heard about Taylor Swift, I thought she was someone doing something differently. Someone doing things \u201cright.\u201d \u2026She just has a better brand and a more cunning team. One of them might even have seven heads if I\u2019m not mistaken. One generation had John Lennon and The Rolling Stones together. This one has Taylor Swift and BTS. It\u2019s basically like we\u2019ve made idols out of the things we\u2019re told are to idolize, rather than things that will actually last forever\u2026 because they made music or did something that was actually real. At a time of great divide and divisiveness and pettiness, we\u2019re stuck looking around at who we\u2019ve chosen as leaders and \u201cinfluencers\u201d and we got Disney stars without any talent but are \u201cfollowed\u201d by everybody, Youtubers, former reality star presidents, the central banking system, and pop stars that can eat a donut and make us care about it. All the while teenagers and even older are pouring their hearts out on social media for a chance to be \u201cheard\u201d and \u201cliked.\u201d Or even more isolating, a superficial comment \u201cwe\u2019re here for you!\u201d or a #gotyourback. I mean not to even go there, but Frank Sinatra got away with murder because he knew the mafia, not because he had a hundred million followers on Instagram. The most shameless people in the world shouldn\u2019t be enabled to shame an entire planet. History shouldn\u2019t be made with a tweet. And music, which can drive the soul, shouldn\u2019t be held hostage by the most disgusting industry, and funneled out by the most disgusting \u201cpeople.\u201d And social media, even though this idea is not trending, is terminal cancer to free thinking and the crucifixion of individuality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe\u2019ve created a mold and it\u2019s spread so far into the structure of our lives and our daily comings and goings that it\u2019s just become the way that it is, and it\u2019s basically like you better fit into that, wear that color, eat that food, like those people, support that brand, or have no chance. And probably everyday, people, children, hearts and lungs of all sizes, shapes, and forms, that have no other real choice and are just designed to try\u2026 try\u2026 try\u2026 always, and give everything until they\u2019re basically just a bag of blood being poured into their CEO\u2019s or company\u2019s or whatever\u2019s chalice, sitting on their throne made out crap and plastic built in China. People like Taylor Swift, who use the word Love to make a profit, and turn It into a commodity, and take people\u2019s natural desire and affinity to care, and make it a currency, are a wasteland that will kill everything in its path that is dear and sacred, and that make Life wonderful. We\u2019ve become a society built on stilts made out of silicone wrapped garbage, and good people and the stuff that makes good people is dying everyday in individuals. We\u2019re corrupting everything natural and worthwhile, and naturally we\u2019re spending and directing our most valuable resources towards marketing things that are nothing, and cheap.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd for those that know better, it is far worse than that. A lot of this stuff is right out of the Epstein Island docufiles, where the most prominent influential \u201crespectable\u201d people of culture and society are doing things behind closed doors far more gross, and disturbing, and real, than could ever be imagined. The things that were \u201callegedly\u201d done at Epstein Island are not just done for sick sadistic narcissists to get their kicks, although that\u2019s definitely a lot of it as well. The things that were done, the way they were done, are for the means of ritualistic practices; more specifically, satanic rituals. Where they meddle, manipulate, sabotage, and sacrifice people\u2019s lives, livelihoods, and souls, all in the name of satan. This is done in ways that are unbelievable, and as gross and perverse as it gets. A small example of something like that is in the lyrics of her song, \u201cfalse god,\u201d the line \u201cmy hips are the altar,\u201d perhaps refers to satanic rituals, such as something called \u2018The Black Mass,\u2019 where Taylor Swift\u2019s naked body is being used as an altar during a ceremony. The title of her album, \u2018Lover,\u2019 in all likelihood refers to The Lover triad of the Ordo Templi Orientis, an occult organization that was spearheaded by someone coined \u201cthe most wicked man on earth\u201d because of things he was willing to do to people. All I\u2019m saying is things are not as they seem. These people, people that are willing to do these kinds of things, are not innocent in any way, and frankly, couldn\u2019t be any further from it. Furthermore I believe they (satanists in general) enjoy doing things to children because of a child\u2019s innocence. It is a show of force and domination, corrupting the magic of youthful innocence and imagination in a child. If one would take pleasure in the complete disgrace of Life, especially disgrace of Life for your own personal gain, then it would only make sense why a child would be the preferred target of these people, because children love everything. If these are the role models we\u2019re going to choose, then we need to know what we\u2019re choosing. If we're going to believe and put stock into an image, then it's important that the narrative behind that image should at least exist. And if the reality is the opposite of the brand built image, then we\u2019ve done something wrong. The idea is to hide in plain site, the idea is to create a new threshold for normal, the idea is to make it look more \u201cinnocent,\u201d etc., let\u2019s at least be aware that the robes, the snakes, the cryptic posts, the eye thing, the agendas, all of it, bares a very real and serious, dark, and even murderous consequence. This is as sick and as evil as it gets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShow me the way a person loves, a real-life living human being, and what they\u2019re willing to give, and you can be assured of that person\u2019s worth. Even if they love and give to the wrong people and things. There are two schools of thought out there that I\u2019m sure most of us are aware of. One is you fell down that hole, get yourself out. The other is I see you in that hole, let me lend a hand. I don\u2019t believe either one of those is wrong. They both have merit. But it shouldn\u2019t be so polarizing where one side says, \u201cI can\u2019t reach that far, let me go get my entire family to help you out,\u201d and the other is laughing at you while you\u2019re climbing, and goes and gets their entire family to throw sand and rocks at you. We don\u2019t have to make things too complicated, do we? No matter who you are, if you witness someone given any set of circumstances succeeding and in triumph, and you can\u2019t bring yourself to recognize that, or you\u2019re actually arrogant enough to reject it, or flat out lie about it, then yes, it\u2019d have to be said there is no place for any real victory, measure of any real worth or value, or even grace for you. Matter of fact, there\u2019s no creature smaller or more insignificant that\u2019s ever existed. In the big picture of things, you\u2019re less than a rat, or any rodent. And an embrace from you would probably turn flesh to ash, bones to dust, and cause your organs to shrivel to stone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook, I never thought I\u2019d be saying anything like this, but who are we, who is anybody or anything really think they are to mock, manipulate, and tarnish to no end somebody and something that does nothing but show you love, care for you beyond belief or reason in every earthly and eternal way possible, and just simply try to be there for you? If I were to bet, I\u2019d bet someday the pillars of this earth that were purchased from Ikea are going to crumble, the ground that isn\u2019t even yours will shake, all the gates and walls that are hollow and translucent will just be brushed aside, and these so called leaders who rule from arrogance and provide with lies will indeed fall and burn. Where will that leave you? Where will that leave your children? \u2026I\u2019m not saying to go run off and whatever or anything like it. Just at what point do we consider trying to do a little better for each other? When you learn, you grow. When you experience, you change. Isn\u2019t it almost our duty as human beings, even strangers, no matter who, no matter what, to make that collective experience something amazing and something that we belong to together? Who\u2019s the asshole that said otherwise? Why\u2019s he worth listening to\u2026 at all? All the cool kids now want to dance actually with the moon, and pray to Jupiter and Neptune, while just this earth, our planet as we know it was designed to provide infinitely and in abundance. All we need to do is try. Just care; a little bit. And we can\u2019t even do that. Some aren\u2019t even capable of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot saying we all need to sing kumbaya, and hand everyone a trophy. I'm not for bubble wrapping the world. But we've maybe crossed a point where we might not be able to get back some of the real richness and flavor that makes a society and culture fantastic, and great. Hollywood is known to be a disgusting place. At least a huge portion of it. Always has been. And perhaps Hollywood just rubbed off onto Taylor Swift... but she does it all soo well. I'm not trying to knock business. I'm saying that is what it is. All it is. And I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel. I'm simply saying it is important who we choose as \"rolemodels.\" It's fair to say Swift does preying on the vulnerable, underhanded sleazy crap, leverage and manipulation, backstabbing,  theft, fraud, and abuse of power, as good as anybody ever has. I've never said and would never say she's not a good high class cheap business woman. She's a natural at what she has been taught. That is it though. That is all it is. It's an image. It's not about anything other than that. I'm saying the narrative, indeed, never existed. I'm saying we as a consumer have gotten the raw end of this deal. I'm saying this is why the quality levels go down. Make it for the cheapest; sell it for the most. Taylor Swift is no different. Beyond that, there is quite possibly an even more dark and sinister agenda than just money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMark Twain said, \u201cIt is curious that physical courage should be so common in the world and moral courage so rare.\u201d He probably said that over 150 years ago. Which is almost like saying people would rather put themselves in physical danger, rather than social danger. It\u2019s terrifying to think back then they didn\u2019t have the internet or social media, everybody didn\u2019t have access to everybody at all times, there was a sense of actual privacy, there wasn\u2019t a constant stream of pressure coming from different sides to be a certain way, and there was no FOMO or systematic protocol for everybody to fit in. The only FOMO was what the Catholic church used to scare Indians and young girls. Which should all be thrown out anyway. Someone over 2,000 years old is probably more understanding than you realize. And obviously there\u2019s The Bible as well, The Word, which all kids should read and familiarize themselves with. If for no other reason, it will make you smarter and more aware. If you don\u2019t know any better, Taylor Swift is a pop star, \u201csong writer,\u201d and an American Idol which so many young boys and girls turn to. Which if that is the most you know, then you might only be burned on a $50 poster. But give credit where credit is due. It\u2019s a great business model, that targets and takes advantage of 14 year old girls. \u2026I guess everybody\u2019s doing it though. What the greater public isn\u2019t aware of with her is that she is much more powerful and resourceful than just social status. She\u2019s a master of sorts. She may even be a host of some of the wildest most influential parties there are!! Granted she also has a tremendous amount of help to do what she does. But what you see is not what you get with her. Her image couldn\u2019t be any further from truth. She doesn\u2019t have as much of a private life as she does a double life. And she is as wicked as it gets. Loooooowwwww, unethical, and fake, fake, fake. Where there\u2019s smoke there\u2019s fire, and there\u2019s certainly been plenty of that. And all this is just merely an opinion from research of her, pop culture and the music industry going back to the 60s and before, interviews, and a little bit of my own experience as a human living in this world. But if you find somebody truly at their most vulnerable with no direction and nowhere to go, you\u2019ll most likely for some time at least be able to lead them anywhere. And like a proper sociopath and con artist, get whatever you need, carve a cozy way out, and cover your ass completely. Beyond your normal flagrant abuse of power, Taylor Swift and some of these people and things are so versed in Biblical knowledge that they can truly lead a young person whose lived a mostly secular life down a road into the pits of utter desolation and ruin. They can actually weaponize The Word of God if you don\u2019t know any better. They are able to take a soul up just high enough so when the time comes to pull the rug out from under them that fall from grace is catastrophic and possibly irrevocable. All the while manipulating them to no end and deconstructing and using their life in every way imaginable or as much as \u201cthey go along with it, or let them.\u201d These people are the subjects, or the muse, for A LOT if not most of these performers, their songs, and their albums, and in the end are probably just hauled off and put somewhere in Madame Tussaud\u2019s basement. Some are also marked with a scarlet letter that will stain and haunt whatever days they have left. And the ends justify the means. Actually nothing is justified and it doesn\u2019t have to be. These are the sickest people on earth. What they do is so calculated and sophisticated and well done, it\u2019s a marvel. It\u2019s seductive, intoxicating, breath taking, and interesting, all at the same time while these people\u2019s lives are being decimated and destroyed. It\u2019s done in phases and with a script or playbook. The only rule is to do whatever you have to do. What that entails is unbelievable and the kind of stuff reserved only for the lowest of the low, and the scum of the earth. It\u2019s a more grotesque abuse of influence, power, and abuse and sabotage of human life than any living human being can actually fathom unless they are victim of it. This is physical abuse, emotional abuse, psychological abuse, mental abuse, professional abuse, financial abuse, social abuse, trauma abuse, spiritual abuse, and perhaps eternal abuse. Every way you can destroy and consume a person\u2019s life, these people know how to do it, and are very good and seasoned at it. And they leave you with nothing, no one, and nowhere, not even yourself. They cut off your lifelines, and things you\u2019ve always relied on. And typically these victims are society\u2019s most vulnerable. They\u2019re isolated, marginalized, typically they have a personality and disposition that would be more receptible to this type of ongoing abuse, and when it\u2019s all said and done these people typically have absolutely no recourse, or even if they might their story is so bizarre and uncomfortable perhaps for anyone who hasn\u2019t gone through the same thing that they\u2019re often not believed even when they do say something. These people are preyed upon and preyed upon and preyed upon, over and over, again and again, until they don\u2019t know what life is anymore, or they don\u2019t want to know, or there just isn\u2019t any life left to prey upon. Believe it or not, this has been going on for years, and certainly appears to be how Taylor Swift has built the majority of her catalog and her fake and fraudulent kingdom. Seems to be just business as usual. If you\u2019re a musician, the people behind the scenes shouldn\u2019t be more important than the actual \u201cartist.\u201d Also, please stop thinking these people are \u201cartists.\u201d Artists don\u2019t destroy the ability for art to function in other people. Artists don\u2019t desecrate the art of Life. And no real artist needs to steal the art of an independent artist on youtube in Australia and pawn it off to Faith Hill and Tim McGraw as a \u201cgift.\u201d\u00a0 The hubris is astonishing. The cover up and actual support of an entire community and world of enablers is unbelievable. The moral code of the new world order: What\u2019s in it (sometimes literally) for me? And how can we get away with it? \u2026Pathetic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand and wouldn\u2019t expect things in Hollywood to be as they appear. But when they are this phony, fraudulent, cheap, disgusting, wrong, and worse than that even or anything that would be easy to believe, something should at least be said. People can control the environment as much as they want, put the kind of pressure and use the same kind of tactics in Harvey Weinstein like fashion to silence people, manipulate, manipulate, manipulate, and then some, but it still doesn\u2019t negate the truth. Branding, presentation, and distribution, that\u2019s all it is. The path to being \u201cuntouchable.\u201d There\u2019s no integrity. \u2026There\u2019s really not much at all. The idea is to play ball, or die, or somehow someway be silenced and eliminated. These people are nothing more than thugs and monsters.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75853, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Concerning Truth (part 1)", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eey8n5/concerning_truth_part_1/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TheWonderingMonk", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_kqoiph8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577171011, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eexusy/powerful_mindful_breathing_demonstration/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eexusy", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General"}], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eexusy/powerful_mindful_breathing_demonstration/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "aSEAYIcH-mw6LU_9v86AkZKyF4eOcaAHvjLGMoxuUaY", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_0QbEyJ72xNhmAkvpvqO79xVrwllSokhjr3VXuN-ZhU.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bafd478fa9f51c363fa279c4e949962d1ef3fe9", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_0QbEyJ72xNhmAkvpvqO79xVrwllSokhjr3VXuN-ZhU.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=308328d33cdd459655a6d442a87574577b7a5f86", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_0QbEyJ72xNhmAkvpvqO79xVrwllSokhjr3VXuN-ZhU.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44f2940a0b6998d8c076348761fe19edf4b2b2fe", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_0QbEyJ72xNhmAkvpvqO79xVrwllSokhjr3VXuN-ZhU.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f4e0f06d8e8386c26c1f008b5f555ccb89abcb76", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1577171014, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello my friends! :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a video I made about a POWERFUL mindful breathing exercise that can shift you out of negative emotions in only a few seconds!

My last streak ended at 20 days because people begin responding weirdly to me and I get serious and sometimes a bit aggressive but keep it under control pretty well. \nAnyways the amount of things I noticed happening around me it was like what I was feeling or thinking would then become real. \n\nJust today I was walking up to Walmart after my chiropractor appointment. And I just thought to myself \"this feels very intense, id like to just let go and have fun with a friend\" then next thing I know, I'm walking out of Walmart and here comes someone I know I joke around with from my chiropractor. Hes like what's up, where you headed? Wanna come Christmas shopping? So yeah we just walk around Walmart and it was fun as hell. I was acting ridiculous because I was so happy to have someone actually want to hang around me and have fun. Lol\nIt's been a long time since I've actually hung around people and had a good time, long story but basically I gradually lost my social skills over years because I moved in with my grandma to take care of her, losing all my friends in the process, etc. \n\nBut anyways yeah, so that literally popped up out of nowhere. It felt different when it happened too, I unintentionally went through the manifestation process.\n\nAnd then I go to work, I'm anxious and angry because people at my work have this weird competitive, rude vibe around me. Especially on SR. Whatever I'm feeling manifests and people respond accordingly. Even though I tried to maintain a straight face and smile people were impolite to me and I was feeling strong anger. \nThen I finally stood up for myself about people blocking my way, and felt that people might laugh at me for expressing myself and standing up for myself. And one person did laugh. So I just gave him a SR fueled stare and kept on talking. \n\nThen I felt weird around people after that, and people started acting weird around me. It's almost like people become my mirror on SR. \nThis one guy at the gym, I thought to myself \"I'll get out of his way, he's respecting my space and he needs to rack his DB\" he looked at me and gave me a nod of respect. \nThis is really trippy and overwhelming to me, especially because I do have a lot of problems with judging others and myself, lots of anxiety and anger and even if I'm acting polite and not trying to let any of this show it still manifests. \nI know, I can't believe it either. \nAlso I'll be thinking something and people will say out loud what I'm thinking. Very trippy. \n\n\nThis is really forcing me to take a HARD look at myself. Ive always been a very introspective, observant, and aware person even as a child. This is just taking this to a new level. \nI don't expect you to believe me or accept this at face value. I doubt i would.

The awakening is whenever you decide it to be, but it continues infinitely whether you're aware of it or not. I see so many people absolutely frazzled out of their minds searching for something that's been in their back pocket this entire time. I myself am a deeply spiritual person, but if that is not balanced by something to keep you grounded then off you go into an endless vortex of questioning your very own existence. Existential crises are on the rise and I see a lot of people losing sight of reality. There is mass amounts of information out there and too often we forget to take time to process that information, let go of what isnt needed now or what doesnt resonate. I speak from my own experience and have spent years upon years studying physics, quantum physics, philosophy, psychology, anthropology, and religions and I can tell you that I am always led back to the same simple ass answer. BALANCE. It can be applied to any problem you're having, more often than not the answer revolves around balancing something or finding the balance in it. \n\nThe spiritual journey is not for the faint of heart and there are levels to this shit. Trying to skip step 1 to go to to step 7 is going to throw you through a whirlwind only to end up back at square 1. Dont force things and allow your life to unfold as is. If you are constantly searching that means you're using your head to think. Let go of expectations and feel. There is no time line, remember that. \n\nYou are perfect just where you are and how you are. Now, life around you may not be perfect but fortunately for us we live in a world of endless possibilities. Too often than not we go to the internet for answers that we already have in search of validation. We all have different experiences and what worked for someone else might not be the same circumstances for you. It's good to gain insight and inspiration from others, but when we start having conflicting thoughts on things that we intuitively know, this is where we lose sight of ourselves. Perhaps the whole \"New Age Spirituality\" is an agenda of some sorts to weed out the mentally unstable. For those who can remain objective and only take in the information that resonates to their core it is a wonderful time to step up and help guide some younger souls.

In a way I feel like it was supposed to happen to awaken me to what I truly deserve. I learned to love myself, and put myself first - to start manifesting what I truly deserve. \n\nEver since then I've become more positive and just letting the universe guide me - I have become more open to energy and attracting what I feel like are my soul tribe (is that a thing?). These past few months have been insane, in a good way! I see the signs everywhere, I met some new people that all share the same interests and happened to be spiritual as well. But one person in particular we just... clicked.\n\nIt's as if I've known him in another lifetime. We are like the same person and I've never met anyone like him. He's been around for months but somehow we connected recently and have become pretty close - as friends! He puts a lot of things in perspective - our minds work very well together, and he brings this childlike happiness into my soul. His energy is like a magnet and he says the same about me. I don't know what it is, but I'm glad to have met him. He has been an amazing friend and we seem to bring out the best in eachother. \n\nThings are a little difficult right now as I'm in a relationship which I have realized is toxic in the long run... I don't know what all of this is trying to tell me but I feel like I know the answer. I'm scared but excited. I know that what ever my decision in the end may be, I will be ok. I have a strong feeling that 2020 is going to be a beautiful year. I'm manifesting everything that I want! \n\nI just want to know, has anyone else experienced this?

I have preached the bible to millions. I have done good deeds.

He couldn't understand this. \"Why won't God let me in?\" he said. So he sat down in front of the gate again. Centuries passed. Remember he was dead anyway so it didn't matter. He was pondering why God didn't let him in. Then it came to him. So again he got up and he banged on the door, on the pearly gates. God came out and said, \"Who are you? What do you want?\"*\n\n*And he said, \"Lord, I am your humble servant, but I must confess my sins. I have had sexual affairs with my female devotees. I have eaten meat and told people I was a vegetarian. But I confess everything to you. Can I come in now?\"*\n\n*So God looked at him and said, \"I don't care what you do, there's no room for you here.\" And went away.*\n\n*Again the holy man said, \"What is this? I've done everything I can. I'm going to sit at this gate if I have to sit here for all eternity, until I find out what the problem is.\"*\n\n*So he sat for years and century after century, pondering. \"I confessed my sins to God. I confessed my good deeds to God. I want to get into heaven. Wait a minute, who is this I? Who is the I that committed sins? Who is the I that committed good deeds? Who is the I that wants to get into heaven? Who am I?\"*\n\n*And all of a sudden he started laughing. It came to him. He rolled over in laughter and he got up and banged on the gate.*\n\n*And God came and said, \"Who are you?\" And he said, \"I am yourself.\" And God opened the gate and said, \"Come in.\u201d There never was a room here for me and you.\"*\n\n*And so it is with us.*\n\n*We claim we want to be self-realized. We do not realize that we are already self-realized, and we just have to let go of believing, \"I am the doer.\" It makes no difference what you've done in the past. It makes no difference if you've done good deeds or bad deeds, as far as self-realization is concerned. Once you know the truth, you become free.*\n\n*The truth is, there is no past. There never was a past. The universe has no foundation. There is nothing to hold it together. Therefore there is nothing that you have done that can keep you out of heaven, so-to-speak.*\n\n*Now remember, this doesn't give you license to go out and hurt people and rob banks, and do whatever you think you want to do because it doesn't matter. That's not what I'm saying at all.*\n\n~**Robert Adams,** ***T51: Everything Leads To Silence***", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75739, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "There\u2019s no room in Heaven for you and God.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eerzx0/theres_no_room_in_heaven_for_you_and_god/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "opheliawistow", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3c3hsq03", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577140257, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eerq5m/why_do_so_many_westerners_look_to_the_east_for/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eerq5m", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 23, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eerq5m/why_do_so_many_westerners_look_to_the_east_for/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577140262, "score": 1, "selftext": "The pagan and spiritual traditions of Europe are really rich they are present in folklore mythology etc etc but people are not interested in the west, they want Eastern spirituality Which confuses me.

I have been on a personal journey of dealing with my past trauma for the past couple of years - instead of running and hiding from it. I'm still struggling, but I have destroyed so many barriers, and I have spent a great deal of time looking into the darkest places and trying to accept those spaces within me as they are. \n\nLast night I had a particularly bad panic attack which caused me to turn and run from myself - this morning while apologizing to myself for abandoning myself, I came to a place where I felt the need to write something. Now I feel it might be valuable to share with anyone else who is looking all over for help in their own quest to heal. \n\nJust remember - help is help, and looking outside for help is fine, but sometimes we can use looking outward to hide from looking inward - I've caught myself doing this often. So, in reading this, I just wanted to remind all of you that eventually all of the work has to be done by you, for you, inside of you. If this doesn't help, no problem, if something else does, no problem, but nothing you read or hear will ever instantly deliver you to yourself. Only you can bring yourself back to yourself.\n\nAnyways, this is what I wrote:  \nSometimes we hold onto pain as a way to document a wrong - an unfairness gone unchecked, a cruelness gone unpunished, an assault gone unseen. \n\nAs if to say: The only record of this happening is my pain, and if I let it go, if I transcend it and transform it, what record will remain? \n\nHow will others know what happened to me, how will others see the injustice I have faced? As if the pain itself is the punishment, while those who inflicted the pain go on, sometimes with no real sense of the gravity of their actions. \n\nThus, we march around carrying our pain and displaying it for everyone so that they will always know: bad things happened to me, terrible things happened to me, things that broke me and scattered me. \n\nAnd if we never learn to put it down, then we cannot move forward anymore, bound in place by a horror that were it not for our memories and our pain, would be only in the past. \n\nIt is not always a choice - PTSD comes, depression hits, panic attacks strike. Regardless, no one can take our pain from us and lay it down. No one can carry it for us forever, even if they can offer us some respite and hold it while when we most need rest. \n\nThe unfairness and injustice of a trauma gone unchecked makes it hard to put it down, as we know it's the only record. So even when we are done with it, we struggle to let go knowing that it means fairness and justice are random at best, and completely absent at worst. To relinquish our pain feels like we are justifying the original wound, and excusing its dispenser.\n\nAs if to heal would mean our abusers and tormentors have finally and totally gotten away with their actions. As if to put it behind us and move away from it was a message to others that we have never been thrown headfirst into the void, alone and scared and helpless in its darkness. \n\nThis isn't at all to say we should forget what has happened to us - though maybe some things are best forgotten if they prove too formidable in their hold over us. It is to say, our pain and our trauma deserve a proper burial, and that in allowing them to die we give ourselves space to trust that all things pass, even if we suffer in flesh until we die, all things pass. \n\nI know the beauty I see, and the joy I am given and give others is sweeter knowing a pain as deep as I have - but to truly live that statement, to be present for those moments, fairness and justice have to be let go. \n\nIt will never be fair, the wrongs others have done to us, the wrongs we do to others as we cycle through the repetitive nature of harm - as if repeating the harm done to us will somehow heal us in turn. It will never be just that some people live entire lifetimes abusing, exploiting, and tormenting others with no reprisal. \n\nThe control we seek over them, the hatred we feel towards them, the quest for revenge - whether achieved or only sought out - will not take the pain away, and will not fill the void inside it has wrought. \n\nSo - whether right or wrong, fair or not, just or unjust - our only option is to put down the pain and move on. Honoring what was lost when it was given - but letting go of it and through it the want and need to cling to it for the hope that it will someday bring us the fairness and justice we seek. \n\nEvery bit we lay down, gives us the opportunity to make room to pick up something better, the space to heal and grow and transform the space where pain has made its mark on us into a space for love, for beauty, for connection, for health and for happiness.\n\nThen, eventually, all of our voids, all of our emptiness, all of our darkness that we have carried for so long, will become shrines that adorn us, beacons of hope for others, tokens of strength, bravery, and courage that remind us of how we turned shit into gold, how we looked at an unfair and unjust world and refused to let it truly break us.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75720, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Some personal insight into healing from trauma", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eeq254/some_personal_insight_into_healing_from_trauma/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "gedukas1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_p3kynp5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577132584, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eepz9r/need_advice/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eepz9r", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Relationships"}], "link_flair_template_id": "ff48d9ae-c323-11e7-bd5d-0e515489cb82", "link_flair_text": "Relationships", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eepz9r/need_advice/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577132585, "score": 1, "selftext": "Long story short i was very deep in my spiritual practice and path.

I read the summary and it looked appealing. The movie then started, and after I finished watching it, I watched it again. (That channel had a repeat function.) My mind was blown, my smile was wide, and I felt great. I had never watched anything like it before. That\u2019s when my interest in spiritual movies began.\n\nFour years passed and then *The Secret* came along. It was also mind blowing for its time. Although it has its controversial aspects now, it was a revolution in spiritual documentaries. Oh, there was also *What the #$\\*! Do We Know?*, but it takes my interest only after *The Secret*.\n\nAfterwards, I became deeply interested in spiritual movies and watched many of them. I made recommendation lists for my followers in Turkey, and now I want to share them with you. I don\u2019t want to give details about the movies, though, because you can look them up on IMDb or whatever. I want to instead share the reasons for why I recommend these particular movies.\n\nFirst let me be clear about one thing, though.\n\n#### What is a spiritual movie?\n\nEverything is spiritual. The life we live is spiritual, because everything comes out of the spirit. If we looked at it from this perspective, there is a vast number of spiritual movies. You can see the spirit in many such movies.\n\nFor me, though, a spiritual movie is one that expands your view, your perceptions, your world, and your being. After finishing one, you do not feel like you are the same person that you were two hours ago. It has touched your soul and made you think and feel deeply. Some of them even blow your mind. Such movies have similar effects on others too. That is what I call a spiritual movie, so I selected movies based on that criterion.\n\n## Classic Spiritual Movies\n\nThese are the ones where I could say, \u201cHaven\u2019t you watched it yet? How can you call yourself spiritual?\u201d\n\n#### \n\n#### The Matrix\n\nYou may well say, \u201cOh, come on! Starting with The Matrix? We\u2019ve all watched it a million times. Give us something new!\u201d\n\nYes, I know. I also said it many times while checking the spiritual must-see lists of others. But last week, I watched the whole trilogy again because I wanted to find clues about \u201cthe loop.\u201d By this, I mean the loop in our minds, which we may call *dharma*. I was thinking deeply about how I could get my mind out of the worldly plane. I then started to watch the trilogy and realized that *The Matrix* is about the trinity of mind, body, and soul. The machines could not understand love and therefore the soul, so the movie gives the message that the best way to get out of the worldly plane is through love.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Celestine Prophecy\n\nJames Redfield\u2019s novel was one of the first books I read in my spiritual awakening days. It is still marvelous, but the movie could have been better I think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Peaceful Warrior\n\nDan Millman\u2019s marvelous book was adapted into a great movie. It touched many people\u2019s souls, as I have witnessed many times. You have to read the book after watching the movie, though. The book has much more, as you can no doubt imagine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Conversations with God\n\nWe all love Neale Donald Walsch, author of the *Conversations with God* series, and this movie is about his life. It is a good movie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Interstate 60\n\nFor me, this is the best spiritual movie of all time. In my mind, it\u2019s a timeless classic. Yet when I checked other people\u2019s lists on the web, I didn\u2019t find this movie in many of them. It may well be that you still haven\u2019t watched it yet. If not, prepare yourself for a spiritual feast. Even after watching it 30 times, like I have, you can still find many messages. Believe me when I say you can watch it many times over without ever getting bored of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### What the #$*! Do We Know?\n\nThis early spiritual documentary was labeled as talking heads (i.e., many experts coming together and talking about something). Quantum physics meets with spirituality and good drama in what is still a must-see documentary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### The Secret\n\nAh! The Secret. We can still argue that it represents the law of attraction, but it is still a great documentary. It gave rise to the term \u201csecret-like\u201d when describing spiritual documentaries. Nowadays, when you mention *The Secret*, many people deride it, but it has still a special place in my heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Fight Club\n\n\u201cThe first rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club.\u201d Okay, I won\u2019t, but I had to put it on the list.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Avatar\n\nIf I feel like an avatar living on Earth, being controlled by someone\u2019s conscious in another place, it is because of this great movie. I had to watch it again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Groundhog Day\n\nA funny, classic movie about being stuck in a time loop. No doubt you have seen it already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Baraka \u2013 Samsara\n\nMovies without words but with many deep meanings. Many years of work went into Ron Fricke\u2019s movies, which are not just spiritual classics but also works of art.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Lesser-Known Movies\n\nThese great movies are adored by many, but maybe you haven\u2019t heard of some of them\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Nossolar\n\nDo you want to know how the afterlife is? Based on the channelings of Chico Xavier, Nossolar is a great Brazilian movie about the afterlife.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bab\u2019aziz**\n\nThis is the most beautiful movie about Sufism ever made. Nacer Khemir\u2019s work is outstanding, and you can feel this great movie fill your soul. The soundtrack is also magnificent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chaotica Ana**\n\nThis is one of the best movies about reincarnation and the goddess. Ana, a Spanish art student, meets Said in Madrid and they fall in love. After Said disappears, Ana starts to undertake hypnotherapy and finds out she has lived many past lives. You can find out the rest in the movie\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### The Man from Earth\n\nThis very beautiful classic movie starts with a boring discussion between six university professors and turns into a great dialogue when one of them confesses that he is 14,000 years old. Still not watched it yet?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring\n\nYou cannot forget this movie, even after many years. Korean director Kim Ki-Duk uses the symbolism of the passing seasons to tell this story of a young Buddhist monk\u2019s evolution from innocence to love, evil to enlightenment, and ultimately to rebirth. Please watch it in HD on a big screen please. It is a Buddhist poem conveyed through cinema.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Powder\n\nIMDb describes it as follows: \u201cAn off-the-charts genius who is home schooled and shunned after his last relative dies shows the unconscious residents of his town about connection awareness and the generosity of the spirit.\u201d It\u2019s the story of an albino boy with psychic powers. It is a classic, and I will never forget the scene with the hunter and deer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Defending Your Life\n\nThis movie is also about the afterlife, but its story is told in a much funnier way. It is about love, karma, and rebirth. You will remember this movie from the scenes of a Japanese restaurant in Heaven.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Serendipity\n\nA romantic movie about love and coincidence starring John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Sliding Doors\n\nJust one door staying open can change your life in this Gwyneth Paltrow classic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Little-Known Movies\n\nIf you\u2019re saying, \u201cCome on, we all know these movies. Give us something new!\u201d Okay, here you go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valley of Flowers**\n\nIMDBsays, \u201cA great Asian love story, an unforgettable tale about passion, death and reincarnation. A mesmerizing Himalayan epic that spans two centuries, from the Silk Route of the early 19th century to the bustling metropolis of modern-day Tokyo.\u201d It\u2019s the most passionate story about soulmates ever made, and the love of Jalan and Ushna will take your breath away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Looking for Muhyiddin\n\nA man (played by filmmaker Nacer Khemir, who also directed *Bab\u2019aziz*) returns home to Tunisia to bury his mother. Following the burial, his father gives him an *amana* to take to a Sheikh named Muhyiddin. The man immediately sets out on an epic journey to find the long-lost Sheikh and deliver the *amana* to him. Throughout his journey, he is guided by a mysterious spiritual master and many friends of the Sheikh who he encounters along the way. As the adventure unfolds, we learn about the rich life of this Sheikh and his uncompromising love for humanity, for under his teachings, different beliefs, faiths, and ways of life can only converge and become one. The more we learn about the Sheikh Muhyiddin, the more we understand why he is so venerated across cultures and continents. Looking for Muhyiddin is a deeply lyrical odyssey into the soul of Islam through the life and the works of one of its most beloved mystics: Ibn Arabi.\n\nThis is one of the best Sufi movies you will ever watch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Happenstance**\n\nEveryone knows *Amelie*, but did you ever hear about this other movie with Audrey Tatou. It is about coincidence and chaos theory, possibly the best one on the subject.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Un Buda\n\nIMDb says, \u201cUn Buda follows two brothers orphaned as children when their parents were taken by the military during the \u2018Dirty Wars\u2019 of the 1970s in Argentina. Tomas is now a drifting and withdrawn young man who experiments with ascetic practices and has an instinctive compassion for others. His older brother Rafael is a university philosophy professor, detached and alone. Their struggles with each other and the world around them in Buenos Aires take a dramatic turn when they find themselves at a rural Zen center.\u201d It\u2019s a great spiritual movie from Argentina\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Now and Forever\n\nIf you want to watch an unforgettable spiritual love story, do not miss out on this one. I watched it many years ago, but some scenes still stick in my mind. IMDb summarizes it like this: \u201cAgainst a backdrop of clashing cultures, John Myron and Angela Wilson find each other and over the years form a powerful bond. One tragic night, John rescues Angela from a wicked act of betrayal. Faced with its aftermath, Angela flees town, unaware that she has put into motion a dramatic and intense string of events that will forever change the course of their lives. Harboring a secret, John guides Angela to a shocking realization that will uncover the past. Now &amp; Forever is a dramatic contemporary love story combining elements of spirituality, heart and integrity. They say sooner or later all love stories will end; Now &amp; Forever is the exception\u2026\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### An\u2026\n\nThis Greek movie is so special for me. We watch a choice and then the consequences in parallel universes. Demetris is a handsome man with a dog. One night while out with his dog, he meets Christina. In the alternate universe, he doesn\u2019t go out with his dog, so he doesn\u2019t meet Christina. We watch both sides of this simple choice. But fate says, if you are destined to meet someone, you will meet him or her whatever. Why is this movie so special for me? In one great scene, Demetris and Christina sit with a coffee and share love. I later found this coffee when I visited Athens and sat with my own love. I will never forget either that experience or this magnificent movie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Storm\n\nIf you loved *The Matrix*, watch this Swedish version. It starts similarly when a man meets a mysterious woman with an evil man chasing her. The story then turns in a different direction. Please just find it and watch it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#### Ink\n\nInk, a mysterious creature, steals a child\u2019s soul with the aim of using it as a bargaining chip to join the Incubi, a group of supernatural beings responsible for creating nightmares. It may seem like a horror movie, but it\u2019s not. The less you know about it, the more you will enjoy it.  \n\n\nI *know many other movies could be added to this list, but this is just a selection to start you off. There are also many spiritual documentaries, but I will share a list of these in our next issue\u2026*  \n\n\nHasan Sonsuz \u00c7elikta\u015f\n\nsource: [www.thewisemag.com](https://www.thewisemag.com)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75642, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Spiritual Movies that Nourish Your Soul", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eej3i3/spiritual_movies_that_nourish_your_soul/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TimmyAts", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_55srylup", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577097579, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eej1k5/unwinding_the_madness_is_it_too_late/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eej1k5", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eej1k5/unwinding_the_madness_is_it_too_late/", "pinned": false, "removed_by_category": "reddit", "retrieved_on": 1577097579, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75642, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Unwinding The Madness \u2013 Is It Too Late?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eej1k5/unwinding_the_madness_is_it_too_late/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "shark-dick", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1xh91jcr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577096690, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eeix1k/my_spiritual_nonspiritual_idealism_rough/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eeix1k", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eeix1k/my_spiritual_nonspiritual_idealism_rough/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577096691, "score": 1, "selftext": "Please Read! Maybe it\u2019ll encourage your spiritual self!\n\nI was smoking a spliff thinking about how my mother she had gone through surgery to change the look of her eyes, I\u2019ll always remember the day I freaked out to her coming home with bandages over her eyes aha, though I\u2019ve been stuck for the last 8 years years thinking about not being able to see the face that gave birth to me, ever again. I came to think how ill minded it is focus on your looks ever since.

With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe Supreme Lord is represented throughout the entire material universes by His entering into all things as the Supersoul. The Lord here tells Arjuna that there is no point in understanding how things exist in their separate opulence and grandeur. He should know that all things are existing due to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's entering them as Supersoul. From Brahm\u0101, the most gigantic entity, on down to the smallest ant, all are existing because the Lord has entered each and all and is sustaining them.\n\nWorship of demigods is discouraged herein because even the greatest demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva only represent part of the opulence of the Supreme Lord. He is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater than Him. He is samat\u0101, which means that no one is superior to Him and that no one is equal to Him. In the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-mantra it is said that one who considers the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the same category with demigods-be they even Brahm\u0101 or \u015aiva-becomes at once an atheist. If, however, one thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the opulences and expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's energy, then one can understand without any doubt the position of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and can fix his mind in the worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation. The Lord is all-pervading by the expansion of His partial representation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is. Pure devotees, therefore, concentrate their minds in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in full devotional service; therefore they are always situated in the transcendental position. Devotional service and worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are very clearly indicated in this chapter in verses eight to eleven. That is the way of pure devotional service. How one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been thoroughly explained in this chapter.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Tenth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of the Opulence of the Absolute.\n\n**Question 1 : Why worship of demigods is discouraged in this verse ? How one get fixed in the transcendental position of pure devotional service to Lord Krishna ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/eegz3h/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1042/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false,

life. They stay hopeful of their desires becoming a part of their reality while staying stagnant of a cycle of living paycheck to paycheck or burdened with depression. As a 19 year old whose undergone so much adversity in the early years of my life from poverty, neglect, mental and physical illness - I\u2019ve spent an extensive amount of time studying spiritual teachers from across the world and found the best methods to turn my entire life around. I\u2019ve never felt healthier, happier, and wealthier after implementing these practices. I felt compelled to briefly yet thoroughly explain how anyone can change their life regardless of their circumstances. Cross-pollinating a vast array of concepts from neuroscience, quantum physics, astrophysics, and philosophies from around the world to teach how anyone can live the life of their dreams and stop being a slave to harmful programming. The methods I describe have helped me unearth my passion: to ignite a lasting transformation in the thinking of modern humanity. I intend to promote a more mindful society, and need your help in doing so! Right now my book is only $4.99 and is packed full of practical advice to step into 2020 living your best life. With every purchase, a donation is made to One Tree Planted, a conservation charity with a mission to help reforestation efforts around the world. If you\u2019re positively impacted by the teachings in my book, please feel welcomed to leave a 5 star review to encourage others to release limited thinking for their own sake, the betterment of our people, environment, &amp; generations to come.

Its been proven by many declassified CIA documents that almost all humans are capable of remote viewing, astral project, ESP, and even things like telekinesis and reality manipulation. And the Archons have trapped us here to consume our energy like the Machines in the Matrix.  We lose our abilities when we sin and fall into darkness, hence why the ruling elite pushes such things at us like porn, alcohol and drugs, start wars, and so on.  The extra chemicals added to our food and water such as Fluoride also effect this.\n\nThis is what Jesus was actually trying to tell us.  Its the reason that the Romans and the Jews had to fight off a revolution of the masses that lasted nearly 300 years that was started by Jesus.  This was the primary reason why they wrote the Bible in 325 AD that basically taught the masses how to be better slaves.  That also didn't contain any of Jesus's actual gospels.\n\nI would recommend this gospel that was used by Jesus and his disciples\n\n[**On the Origin of the World**](http://gnosis.org/naghamm/origin-Barnstone.html)\n\nIt goes into depth about how Earth was created, and how humans ended up here.  And the real version of the Adam and Eve story that Jesus shared.\n\nI highly recommend checking out some of the ancient texts from the Nag Hammadi.  They are almost all gospels and texts from Jesus and his Apostles that got left out of the Bible.  The Sophia of Jesus, which came directly from Jesus is quite mind blowing, he tells about how creation started, how the heavens were created, and even the meaning of life.\n\n[http://gnosis.org/naghamm/nhlalpha.html](http://gnosis.org/naghamm/nhlalpha.html)\n\nOne of the strangest parts of the Bible that was written in 325AD is it almost completely leaves out the Archons, who Jesus claimed was the source of evil in our world and what actually caused the masses to stand up against them and the ruling elite who worshipped these Archons.\n\nThe Archons are lead by the Demiurge. In Jesus's and other gnostic teachings he is known as Yaldabaoth, Samael, Saklas, the Blind God, the Lion faced God, and the Beast.  Father of all the Archons(dark gods) and demons and creator of Earth and our solar system.  He was described as having the head of a Lion.\n\nThere's a lot of belief that he was the actual God in the Old Testament, and not the same God as the one Jesus came to tell us about.  Hence why the Old Testament God was so drastically different and dark.  The Lion of Judah is the 2nd biggest Jewish symbol after the Star of David.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon\\_(Gnosticism)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon_(Gnosticism))\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge#Yaldabaoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge#Yaldabaoth)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust look at ancient Egypt, they had three distinct ages, the first was a golden age, then came a dark age, where the worshipped gods were changed to the Ogdoad that resembled the known Archons, before the age of Osiris that brought back a new golden age to Egypt.\n\nThe Rich Elite of our world actually worship these Archons and Dark Gods such as Ba'al and Moloch(Bohemian Grove).\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o\\_TBQ\\_gIIU&amp;t=4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o_TBQ_gIIU&amp;t=4s)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75538, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "I believe we are Gods, but trapped and fed on", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eed5ld/i_believe_we_are_gods_but_trapped_and_fed_on/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Distinct-Donut", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_54pqm2tc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577061587, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eecxdv/sun_god/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eecxdv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Enlightenment"}], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eecxdv/sun_god/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577061591, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hiya,  \n\nEgo is not a particular reason I write sharing my thoughts and experiences.  Ego is something people want seperation from, the one-ness of being.  The symbiotic view is not something I share particularly.  I have seen many with a symbiotic and even parasitic union between each other.  \n\nThe symbiotic and parasitic union is something I despise in experience.  While many can unite and be symbiotic, their ideologies may still become conflicted.  One cell may outweigh the others, taking on the lead.  This is something we must understand in argument of unity.  The cell is not functioning with a still independent acting individual, acting as one with the brood.  \n\nRe-Incarnation was something ego went on about, my incarnation stories.  I go on to humor, to share stories of previous ages.  Some went on to mention the youth sharing stories.  Children telling stories about missing their friends or loved one's from previous lives, sometimes very traumatic stories.  Stories of accidents or war, stories from our children, missing their friends.  That is not something I am prepared to talk about.  It was recently brought to attention and not something I would confront, to bring closure.  I have no closure, I only have my share.  \n\nI prefer the discussion of spiritual talks in energy, not religion or dogma.  I like to talk about the Chi or trademarked, \"Force\".  I'm not a martial artist, I have struggled with a crippled body.  While I may beat you down and toss you around like scrap, I am handicap.  I didn't bother braving the legions of hungry, blood thirsty warriors, naming to make a name for themselves.  These days the teaching in Qi are lighter in the West over brutality and raw physical power - not tying into the physiology and energy manufacturing of the body.  \n\nI was only recently catching up on energy theory in different fictions, Dragon Ball, Star Wars, others...  They want to link our physical body to the energy realm.  This is through cellular reception, like, \"Midi-chlorians\", by \"Star Wars\".  I'm not trying to get in a law-suit.  \n\nI do not exactly know how to relate the cellular membrane to the energy membrane, other than that the two are in exact relation...  Like this membrane of our physical body is directly connected to the membrane of the energy cell.  I would rather not give you a dumb down talk.  We're seeing advances in cellular studies and physics and all.  What may link us to the energy/light level is our cellular membrane.  \n\nThese beings in the Star Wars were of a heightened \"Midi-Chlorian\" level, an energy cell.  I do not know if that related in any way to us or is purely fiction.   However, we do have an energy level that is created through our bodies manufacturing, electrical, bio-electrical, kinetic,  we produce ridiculous amounts of energy.  Whether we harness is at will is not documented...  We do harness these cellular energies through will, electricity, and muscle.  When you use your muscles all kinds of energies are firing, I won't go on some dumb down example of the energies firing in muscle use. \n\nEnergy through a different use of will is like, gravity, and all other sources around you, outside of your bodies creation.  The manipulation of energy is difficult to explain and what many cults dedicate in around the world.  \n\nThe Shaolin's studies would be nominal in disclosure.  The disclosure of the Shaolin studies would be the greatest in energy studies I could imagine.  \n\nI'm not schooled in martial arts, only found myself adept in energy fields.

Not very often do we hear weapons judged by their metal these days. It's sang to me and I felt like the Sport 2 4140 Steel was inadequate. Certainly it's more than adequate and treated and ready for battle. Still, remembering to grade weapons by their steel is something that shouldn't be forgotten.\n\nHowever, Daniel Defense and other higher grade steel manufacturers weapons are triple to quadruple the price. You're paying for the steel and less risk of heat issues with the metal, not that you would regularly find yourself in an intense battle.\n\nSweet rifle, affordable, remember the grade of steel though. That's gone back to the Iron Age.\n\nThe red dot is a nice perk but you want a scope, 1x, 2x, anything. Red Dots are awful, unstable in movement.

For the purpose of finding out the truth of what you are, follow me (do not only read, but experience directly the truth) and be sincere, do not overthink anything, do not conceptualize anything, do not imagine anything. Simply be and look what I am pointing too. Is that ok? If so, continue reading.\n\nLets say your name is \"Sufferer\"  \nYou are currently identifying as an identity named \"Sufferer\". Is that correct?\n\nOk, so there is an awareness of this identity named \"Sufferer\", otherwise you wouldn't be able to tell me that there is an identity named \"Sufferer\". Is that correct?\n\nOk, there is an awareness of even this awareness of this identity, otherwise you wouldn't be able to tell me that there is an awareness of this identity. Is that correct?\n\nOk, so there is an identity which currently you are identifying as.\n\nThere is an ever-present awareness of this identity.\n\nThen there is YOU, the WITNESS of this ever-present awareness.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nKnowing this, that you are not the identity, simply misidentifying your self to be the identity, while it is such a small part of you that it barely exists, and has absolutely nothing to do with you but has everything to do with some kind of mechanism of the mind trying to take things personally, this is the truth of who and what you are, the witness of not only the identity, but the awareness that is always aware of the identity, you are beyond both. Is this disappointing? You may comment in the comments. This Self-Realization is what is called \"Enlightenment\" as long as you stay in this awareness of your self as the witness. This is the state in which Christ, Buddha and all the other enlightened beings were residing in. Completely imperosnal nothingness, emptiness and everythingness. This is your natural state, and while you are aware of your self, your natural perfume is joy, love and peace. Be your self and enjoy witnessing existence! \u2665\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome examples of suffering of the identity, while in fact it is all you identifying with thoughts in your head instead of being aware of your self:\n\nI can't dance! I am too insecure to dance... Everytime there is a situation that arises and I feel like I want to dance, I can't bring my self to do it. I am worthless. I always have these thoughts about the fact how I can't even dance, something so simple. I want to be free! \n\nThis is a witness of awareness identifying with thoughts of the identity, and because of that there seems to be \"suffering\" while in fact the witness of awareness if aware of him self can easily dance and do whatever he wants, he simply needs to stop identifying with the thoughts saying \"Oh I need to dance now! If I can't dance I am pathetic\" because these thoughts are not original to the being it self. Not only that but there is actually no need at all for this witness to dance. It was just a projection of the identity, but it is not even necessary to be happy. Once you are aware of the witness, you realize this.\n\nI am too fat! I am so insecure... every single time I see a girl with a body better than mine, I start crying and I start thinking that I must fast for a week straight because I am so fat... I will never be at my goal, I will never be beautiful!\n\nThis is a witness of awareness identifying with thoughts of the identity, and because of that there seems to be \"suffering\" while in fact the witness of awareness if aware of him self can easily lose weight and do whatever he wants, he simply needs to stop identifying with the thoughts saying \"Oh I will never lose weight! It is impossible for me. I am too useless!\" because these thoughts are not original to the being it self. Not only that but there is actually no need at all for this witness to lose weight, it was just a projection of the identity, but it is not even necessary to be happy. Once you are aware of the witness, you realize this.\n\nI am so ugly... I will never find a girlfriend, I look like absolute shit and because of that people treat me like shit and everything in the world is shit. All good looking guys are lucky and God just hates me and put me through this suffering.   \nThis is a witness of awareness identifying with thoughts of the identity, and because of that there seems to be \"suffering\" while in fact the witness of awareness if aware of him self, can easily find girlfriends, although there might be not to this identitys preferred liking. He simply needs to stop identifying with the thoughts saying \"Oh I will never find a girl friend, I am useless, I am ugly and I am depressed\" because these thoughts are not original to the being it self. Not only that, but there is actually no need at all for this witness to find a girlfriend and have a good looking body, it was just a projection of the identity. It is not even necessary to be happy.

I will explain each one first and then I would like your opinion on whether it is OK to let these people go or if there is perhaps a higher purpose to be served here. \n\nI should let you know that both these friendships are INTERNET based where we met through our hobby and later made a server where we hung out almost on a daily basis with cams/microphones and would chat about just about anything as we did our hobby.  Both friendships felt right at the time as I was not yet on my path to seek truth: I was drinking, smoking pot, and other things that did not align with who I truly am at heart.  \n\n\\---------------------\n\n**Friend #1**\n\n*Very nice person, almost TOO nice.  Always complimenting, yet sketchy as he is very 2-face, he will talk horrible things about people behind their back and when they are around, he compliments them and treats them as if he was their best friend.  I tried to look past this, but the more and more I progress on my journey, the more he throws jabs at me and starts talking about the things he KNOWS upset me but he does so in a very low key, just enough to trigger me but not enough to reveal his true intentions.*  \n\n*He internalizes EVERYTHING and never has the nuts to STAND UP and say what he really feels, he's VERY passive aggressive to the point where he is still trying to fetch revenge for something tiny I said a year ago it seems like.  But he will NEVER admit to it, EVER.  If I ever bring anything up, he changes the subject and avoids conflict, ALWAYS.*  \n\n*It is ALL about HIM.  He ignores just about every message I send him unless it's an opportunity for him to show his knowledge or there is something in it for HIM.  BUT, when he comes back around, I forgive him because he is so good at being \"nice\" but I've about had it and it's making me feel ILL (literally).*  \n\n*For the longest time I wondered if it was all in my head but the evidence is simply too much to ignore and I want out of this friendship but afraid myself to make the wrong call.*\n\n*This \"friend\" appears to me as a part-time \"friend\" who only comes around when it's convenient for him.*\n\n**Friend #2**\n\n*He claims to ALWAYS be there for me and that he cares for me as a brother, etc.  We bonded strongly while I was on one of my lows in life and needed help: He re-introduced me to Christianity.  I fell for it all and he felt like a god teaching me all about it and I guess in his eyes he must have thought \"YES! another soul won!\"* \n\n*Since then, I've woken a bit and moved away from the church and into my own path.  He also has not nuts to tell me that that upsets him as i'm sure he feels \"NO! another soul lost to the devil!\" when that couldn't be further from the truth.  I am so tired of his BLACK/WHITE | GOOD/EVIL mentality as it's building heavy doubt in me along with fear that I might be on the wrong path.  Ugh.  So upsetting to see how church shattered  A LOT of my self confidence, but I'm working hard on getting it back!*\n\n*This \"friend\" is a friend so long as I am on the road he thinks is right for me and I believe that which he believes.*  \n\n*-----------*\n\nPart of me wants to stay and give them both the benefit of the doubt and grind through these emotions, while another part of me tells me to RUN and don't look back, to be thankful for the experiences, but sever the chords before things get any worse. As I said, both these \"friendships\" are DRAINING me and upsetting me when I know they have NO right to. Help. :( \n\nMy question: What do you think? Is it wrong to walk away from these type of relationships or am I overreacting? I've gone through so much these past couple years that it's hard for me to fully see what is right/wrong at this time as I evolve into a 'new earth.'  If it is the right thing to let them go, how should I do it?

I take the actions of others personally. if something negative is directed towards me, I tell myself that they have their own struggles and morals, and that I can\u2019t possibly take offence (Unless it\u2019s deeply unfair to me), because I\u2019m always doing the best I can. yet, despite this encouragement I give myself, and the knowledge that it\u2019s their own struggle to impose that on me, I always feel damaged. \n\nI want to shed this sensitivity, so that I can further remove my ego.

The cashier, being either negative or positive, gets drawn into your negative energy and therefore might be hostile or negative towards you, unconsciously. Therefore you just attracted more negativity into your life to then strengthen your negative beliefs.\n\nIf you are walking into a store, you are filled with love and positivity, with clarity in your mind and honest compassion, you go to the cashier and you are all happy and friendly (as it is in your nature, effortless), the cashier being either negative or positive, gets drawn into your positive energy and therefore will be much more friendly, it is practicaly impossible to stay in your thoughts when true light is present, suddenly all negativity vanishes even for a few moments, everything is filled with bubbly peace. Therefore you are being positive, and you attract even more positivity as you are.\n\nLaw of Attraction about money lets say, you are positive about money, handing it out freely, completely unbothered by any kind of money problems, and you encounter more people who mind less, and therefore makes you attract people who are more like you, just be seeing you and your attitude towards money, they feel themselves like it is allowed and it is fine to have much more freedom about money, and you might get a gift of money or someone will be willing to donate you.\n\nIf you are always cautious about money, scared that it will go away and you will be homeless and you have no trust in the universe, people who are existing near you will see how scared you are, they will get drawn into that fear as well and therefore will be less willing to give out money, they will treat their money like you treat your money, with extreme caution and hostility.\n\nSo to attract the best, BE FREE, BE YOUR SELF and you will attract freedom and other selves :D", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75332, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Law of Attraction explained -

In a nutshell, it means it\u2019s not uncommon to do something kind or thoughtful for someone without suffering adverse consequences of any magnitude, which includes being taken advantage of. \n\nWhen we go out of our way to do a good deed, sometimes we give with the intention of receiving a reward from a higher power or from the person we did the good deed for. The problem with giving while in this state of mind is you cancel out the purpose of doing a kind act. Remember, our universe is just a group of mirrors. You can't manipulate a mirror; you can only make changes to yourself if you want your reflection to change. Just like you can't manipulate a mirror, you will never be able to manipulate the universe. Even if you were to lie to yourself, you would receive a reflection that would deceive you and eventually put you in an undesirable position. This means if you give with the intention to gain a return, you will only attract someone who will do the same by trying to take a mile after you gave an inch. Fortunately, there is a way to do good for others that will show returns, but it's a bit of a dichotomy because you aren't supposed to do it for the payback. Instead of looking good to your co-creators, you want to look good for yourself and the universal mirrors.\n\nThe way to properly give is first to appreciate what you have to give and appreciate that you have it. Whatever it may be that you give, you should give it while feeling grateful that you are able to give, because you have plenty. By giving with this state of mind you give with pure intentions and are able to forget about it because you aren't looking for anything in return.\n\nLet's say you have a good friend who needs financial help. Maybe he is behind on an electric bill, and if he doesn't pay what he owes, his electricity will be cut off. Let's also say you have plenty of money and you can help your friend. If you were to give the money to your friend, you wouldn't miss it. Of course, you appreciate having money and you work hard for the money you earn as money doesn't grow on trees. You give the money to your friend knowing you have it. If you did it right, you would know what it is to have plenty, make a difference, and be genuinely grateful for your well-being. Instead of seeking the gratitude of your friend, you would be too busy feeling gratitude for your abundance. At first, It will feel strange to help someone then sincerely thank a higher power for being able to do it. \n\nIf your mindset is in a place where you acknowledge you have it, and you give it to a respectable source who truly needs it and isn't taking advantage of you, then you can give thanks for having it and move on with your life of abundance. However, let's say you do a good deed just to do a good deed. Let's say you do it for a \u201cthank you\u201d or positive acknowledgment. You do it because you want someone to acknowledge your good side and you want to feel special. You want to prove to yourself you are a good person by seeking out the cheerful reciprocation of a thankful human being. You do it because you're acting out a role and want someone to play the part where he or she says you are terrific or whatever warm fuzzy word comes to mind. Maybe you feel guilty and want to make it up to a higher good. Maybe you want to be able to tell others what great things you did for your fellow humankind. Do you see where I'm going with this? If Truth were an entity and you wanted to get the instant, undivided attention of this entity, then this is what you need to do because these scenarios are like the smell of sex to Truth. Do a good deed with alternative intentions, other than to be genuinely kind, and the wrath of Truth will be drawn to you faster than a fly is drawn to poop. Simply put, the wrath of Truth upon you is the result of your insincerity. When we are insincere, our beliefs, intentions, actions, and expectations are out of balance.\n\nAs human beings, when we do something for someone, we would like to be recognized and thanked for doing it. This recognition would require that the person you're doing a good deed for understands you're doing a good deed for that person. There is a rule about believing in something while you're doing it. If it is not true, the more you try to convince yourself, the more whiplash you get. This whiplash is usually what happens when you do a good deed solely for the sake of doing a good deed because you did it for a gesture of gratitude (which counteracts the purpose of doing the \u201cgood deed\u201d). You expected a gesture of gratitude because you believed you were helping out this person, which may not be the case. This person might find your assistance to be intrusive. \n\nOn a similar note, if that person is supposed to be in a predicament and you are trying to help get that person out for the sake of being a hero, you may be interfering with a lesson or experience that person needs to learn. What I'm trying to say is, you might be doing someone a disservice. Furthermore, if that person needs to have a specific experience or lesson to learn and you are taking that away, then you will get the whiplash for it. In other words, you will accrue negative karma and will have to endure an experience to understand that some people need to be left to their own devices. \n\nIf your intentions are pure and the good deed makes a disaster, you will be exempt from the crucifixion you would receive if the good deed were laced with your ego. Here's a simple rule of thumb to live by concerning generosity. If it would bother you to move on knowing you did not help, or the person in question would be without help, then assist that person. An attitude like this will spare you punishment for doing a good deed. Otherwise, don't do it. Maybe the young girl with the flat tire makes you think of your daughter, so you help her change it. Perhaps the old man who is stuck on a bench reminds you of your grandfather, so you help get him a wheelchair. Whatever your reason, you do it so you can look in the mirror with dignity for one more day, and nothing else. If you genuinely do a good deed and things go awry, you will only get a small slap on the wrist. You won't be beaten into submission because your ego was involved.\n\nAll that being said and for a quick recap, every time you give, you must finish with pure inner gratitude for what you have after you give. Leave your ego out of the process and simply reflect on how well you have it as you give. Be thankful you have whatever it is you offer and be thankful you have enough to pull someone else out of their rut. That recognition will shoot through the clouds, into the universe, and reflect back to you. That recognition will begin to be your new truth and truth of your real personal power. \n\n\\~Nicholas D'Arezzo\\~", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75292, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "How To Do A Good Deed Without Being Punished", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/edsbk2/how_to_do_a_good_deed_without_being_punished/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "libralibrasun", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3yt1s8n3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576947698, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/edsac6/what_do_you_feel_when_you_think_of_2020_what/", "gildings": {}, "id": "edsac6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 59, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/edsac6/what_do_you_feel_when_you_think_of_2020_what/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576947699, "score": 1, "selftext": "I feel growth.

Once you understand this bit you are truly free. At first there was nothingness. Think about it, nothingness has to exist because if it doesn't, by defenition it automatically does exist. The ancients call this the Great Void. This is the origin of everything.\nIf there is nothing, there is a vacancy for everything to exist. This is called the Great Spirit - always in a timeless process of infinite creation. So the void created spirit and equally spirit created void, and they are interchangable. - This is the true meaning of the yin and yang. \nThis is the ultimate source of the duality we experience on the earth plane, positive, negative; male, female etc. \nBut in a bigger perspective they are one and the same. - Understanding this is the trancending of duality.\nSo next what happened is our particular reality was created through a specific geometric function; the 2D conversion of which is referred to as the Flower of Life.\nI highly recommend doing research on this topic and other sacred geometry, its too deep of a topic to discuss here.\nBut ultimately what it created was an interlaced reality of many dimensions, each zooming in to a more and more specific 'space'.\nAnd that's where we are, fairly zoomed in to the 4th dimension (or 3rd density).\nThe way this beginning unfolded ripples down all the way to us in this moment.\nSince the one source created all, the one singular spirit is acting as many things, and it can as it is not bound to space or time.\nEffectively what this means is that every atom is the same atom, existing everywhere and interacting with itself at the same time.\nSimilarly every person is the same person at their core, with differences in experience on multiple dimensions.\nSo when you talk to someone - or for example are reading these words - you are communicating with yourself.\nThis means that nothing is outside yourself - That's why monks spend most of their time meditating, because the entire world is within.\n\nIf you think about everything coming from one, that means everything has to be one specific thing. What is the only thing you know exists? What is the only thing that you can know exists? \nIt's your concious awareness of yourself. That is the only thing that truly exists. So all matter is made of conciousness. It's not as static and certain as it seems. Matter flows like a river or idea and is based on the observer. Scientists studying quantum mechanics are beginning to scratch the surface of this.\n\nThe most life changing thing to take away from this is that you are all spirit everywhere -god, and god is you. There is no power greater than you, only equal. You are the entirity of the creator spirit manifest in this dimension to play, learn, have fun, create and evolve. And everyone else is you from a different perspective.\n\nAlso as you suspected reincarnation is real and death is an illusion. Your soul is immortal and can never be destroyed. Also 'past lives' are technically concurrent lives since time is just an illusion. Anything you do in this moment affects all your lives throughout space time. \n\nEverything that you experience outside is a reflection what your inner state. If you hate you are hated, if you give you are given to, if you love you are loved etc.\n\nThe reality we experience is akin to a dream, you can manifest anything you want. But since our dimension has a higher density, while inside, things can seem to manifest slowly, compared to a dream where anything you think of manifests instantly. Also your dreams are just as valid and real as what you experience while awake.\n\nThe force or principle that holds Great Spirit connected with itself is your favourite topic, Love! Love is basically the relationship spirit has with itself, so you can feel love for everything and anything that exists, as it is a part of you. I'm sure you are already very well acquainted with it and intuatively know what it is.\nThe distinct lack of love on our earth that you might have noticed is not natural and our main goal is to return to the path of love as a collective.\nSomething happened around ten thousand years ago that lowered our vibration as a species and resulted in us moving in spirit from our hearts to our brains.\nThis is mainly from where all the unbalance comes from in our world. \n\nAnything created with the brain has duality to it due to the two hemispheres of the brain. If you try to create something - music for example - with your brain through logic and ego, it can work out in a way like make you money, but it always, always has an equal but opposite reaction, like spreading a disharmonious message or not making you truly happy.\nWhen one learns how to create from their heart centre with love - like you do so evidently - there is only pure love and goodness that can come from it. This is because the heart is the centre of unity and is not polarised.\n\nYour heart always knows the way. It always knows what is right. So follow your love so intense to the end without any doubt.\n\nIf people were to think a lot less and reconnect with their unconditional love for the universe and instinctually act from that, every issue on the earth will be solved overnight.\n\nIf you are interested in more of these topics here are some things to do research on:\n\nThe Merkaba -\nAlso known as the light body is a counter-rotating field of geometries around every thing. Esentially it's the projector system for the universe that results in the illusion of space and time. It is also the key to personal space and time travel. \nIt is a living field that allows things into your perception or not. Once one learns how to use it, one can block anything you don't want or need from affecting you at all.\n\nThe Emerald Tablets - \nA very ancient text that is the predecessor to all religious texts. Basically a how to guide to our entire reality but it's not simple to decipher and some things might have been lost in translation through the ages. Even Isaac Newton had a copy!\nIf you read it with an open heart a few times it will for sure teach you something you didn't know.\nA translation can be found on the internet really easily!\n\nHigher self / Oversoul-\nLiterally you on a higher dimension trancending time. Higher selves have higher selves all the way to unity.\nOnce one connects with their higher self conciously, they (you) will be the best source of guidance you will ever get.\n\n\nOther topics:\n\nSacred geometry-\nFlower of Life\nThe golden mean (spiral)\nPhi Ratio\nFibonacci sequence - There is more than one sequence, one starts with 2,1,3,4,7 etc.\nFruit of life\nThe vesica picies\nMetatrons Cube\nTube torus\n\nBreathing prana\nAstral projection\nHolographic universe\nThe Human Mortal Coil - Hard to find info on this one sometimes.\nEarth's energy grids\nThe Ascended Masters\nBecoming a sun\nAkashik Records\nThe Sumerian Tablets\n\nMuch love!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75274, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I want to write a letter to a friend to try and convey most of what I have learned on the Path.

If you are not in the routine of cord cutting, I would highly recommend incorporating this into your daily routine. It is a powerful tool that will help you maintain your own energy and not take on other peoples. Along with protection, cord cutting is something every awakened person should use.  \n\nThere is a few ways of going about the actual cord cutting. However, just because you cut your cord once, does not mean it will be good forever. Some of these techniques may need to be repeated multiple times. Cords can be connected from your end or their end. Cords can also be attached intentionally or unintentionally. Also there are good cords and there are bad cords. I always tell my clients and people I teach that it is important to be specific. When you cut cords ask for all the unwanted cords to be cut or anything that doesnt serve me. Unless of course you want everything cut.\n\nAs for the actual cord cutting itself there are a lot of different ways of going about this. One thing you can do is use your fingers as scissors or your hand as an axe and just visually cut all the cords in front of you. This may have to be done a couple times if they are strong ones. Another easy and powerful way to do it is to call in the white knight and visualize the white knight coming in and cutting all your cords for you. As well, archangel Michael is a beautiful soul that can cut all negative and draining cords and then vacuum out any negative energy. Finally, black obsidian, especially the arrow heads are specifically designed for this. If you have one you can just run it along your body with the intention to cut all cords.\n\nThe main thing is doing this on the regular or anytime you feel something attached to you. Then once you have the cords removed you need to protect yourself like its going out of style. That will ensure that its a lot harder for cords to penetrate your energy body. I actually made a video a couple weeks ago with my entire protection rituals. If that is something that interests you send me a PM and I will send you a link.

Everything that comes to your mind as components that make you into you. When everything else is gone, altogether, all at once, what is left behind of you?\n\nWho are you? Who?\n\nIf you are neither of those things, then what are they? How and from where did they come to you? If you do not own any of those things, which you really don\u2019t, you would realize it during your funeral at the very least. So, who is the owner of it all? And why did that owner give all of this to you? Was it so that you could lose your head and forget who you are, because you worry constantly about losing those things?\n\nYou make a sandcastle for a boy to play with, and then all of a sudden, you realize the boy\u2019s not playing with it but is instead mesmerized with its beauty and trying to stake a claim over it. He gets nervous, becomes tense, and even fights with other kids to stop them from approaching the sandcastle. And he does this on an infinite beach with plenty of sand. Isn\u2019t that odd?\n\nAre you any different to this child? If not, then why don\u2019t you play with it? Wouldn\u2019t those who made the castle make you another one if needed? Wouldn\u2019t they fill the entire beach with enormous sand castles if they had to? Wouldn\u2019t they invent brand new games, so they could hear your laughter and see you jump up and down with joy?\n\nThe beach belongs to Him/Her, but what is your part? Is it to try and obtain the deeds to the beach? Is it to start a sand castle cooperative? If you have realized that none of this is possible, then what else can you do other than play?\n\nAnd the one who set up this game for you has prepared many other beautiful things for you, and you\u2019ll go crazy with joy when you see them\u2026\n\nAnd who are you? Who can you be, other than His/Her breath?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHasan Sonsuz \u00c7elikta\u015f\n\n[www.thewisemag.com](https://www.thewisemag.com/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75241, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Who Are You Really?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/edok5z/who_are_you_really/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "butdontcallmebae", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_igglg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576918595, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ednqs1/coming_back_home_feels_weird/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ednqs1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ednqs1/coming_back_home_feels_weird/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576918597, "score": 1, "selftext": "I've spent the last 11 months or so undergoing what feels like the most profound transformation of my life.

However, I've always felt disconnected from our reality and from others due to my thought process and how my brain works. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, audio processing disorder, adhd, addictive personality disorder, probably partial psychosis, and severe depression. Whether I was born with these disorders or picked them up through trauma I've experienced in my life idk.\n\nI was born in August of 2001 and was a normal healthy baby up until the age of 5. I started going to school at the age of 5 and was always adored by my teachers and was constantly told by my parents that so and so said you were so polite and charming. Before I was able to comprehend a lot of things that have happened in my life I just felt like anyone else really. It was later in the school year (kindergarden) where I started to realize that my behavior and personality was far different from the average kid. My personality is one of a very intelligent (not book smart), charming, mature, and an extremely happy and loving person but also very erratic behavior, always high energy levels and uncontrollable emotionally crippling mood swings, unable to focus, and much slower than the other students.\n\nHere's where the story starts. My parents, piers, teachers would always tell me I'm different but in a good way. However I was unable to control my behavior such as lack of focus, can never sit still, slower than literally all of the other students and had a hard time fitting in with others but at the same time wss able to connect with others very well. I first starting noticing I was different due to my extreme politeness, confidence, and charm. I was what you would call an extremely bright kid but also a very fucked up human being. I starting noticing I was different because whenever I would meet someone new I would put out my hand and shake with a firm grip while saying \"Very nice to meet you my name is ***\" from like the age of 5 and could even hold intellectual conversations with adults. But whenever I would see other kids asked to introduce themselves to another adult most of them would either shy away or very ocquiredly introduce themselves. Regardless I had a lot of issues and would multiple times a week go to doctors, therapist, psychologists who would make me take all different kinds of test and exercises studying my personality. Eventually my parents had enough of me and put me on all different types of drugs such as very strong vivanse, celexa, zoloft, phocolon at just the age of 7 which caused me bad anxiety, unable to talk to others, no appetite, very very bad depression but at least I was sitting still and focusing lol. So this was basically my life up until 8th grade.\n\nFast forward into 7th grade I was picked on by my age group by other kids and would sometimes have emotional breakdowns out of nowhere during class or whenever. But then, PUBERTY hit like a motherfucking train. I started to become very self aware of myself and the effect I had on others around me and found out I was very good with understanding human psychology. Ultimately 7th grade was being in a cult christian school with a class of 20 kids. Rumors and negativity always going around and a lot towards me like \"I raped a girl\" and was called a rapist by other students constantly, being the last picked for ball, and/or being ignored by everyone. But I never took part in negativity or rumors and was alway loving towards others even the ones who picked one me. 7th grade year was so bad for me is when 8th grade my life starting falling apart.\n\n8th grade year I stopped giving all fucks because i felt like i was worthless and craved acceptance from others. I started hanging around people who manipulated and abused me physically and mentally while buying and smoking weed with them. Sneaking out on my golfcart in the middle of the night at age 13 while going across the highway just to meet up with people to smoke and drink and be treated like shit. Then the summer before 9th grade I found what I didnt know was lsd in my brothers drawer with my friend and we both took that. Ironically got caught smoking weed the same day but never got caught with acid. \n\n9th grade (15 years old) came around and I was still smoking weed but was with new friend groups. These were 20 year old hood niggas who i would go to trailer parks in the hood to smoke weed with at night when I snuck out. I eventually got jumped by 5 of them when trying to buy shrooms. After this I got a new dealer who sold me lsd which I did multiple times within a month while my brain was still developing. I then became a drug dealer and started selling weed and acid. \n\nIts now 10th grade and one day when I was selling a zip to 2 of my what I thought to be friends, they tried to rob my ass and I unintentionally ended up stabbing 2 of my friends I loved so dearly and almost killing them. A week later 6 cops came to my school classroom where I was arrested and sent to prison as a 15 year old kid instead of juvenile detention. I was put in solitary confinement for over a week because I wouldve been raped if I was put in the general population. I was eventually bailed out by my dad for $60,000. After that the story was so popular it almost made ABC news and everyone of my friends, family, and everyone I ever knew saw the story. I lost so many people I loved and was spotted almost everywhere by people who tried to jump me, called me names, people I thought were my friends spreading rumors about me. The 2 kids lied about the story and said I jumped in the car and started stabbing them while saying \"Im going ti fucking kill you\" when in reality I was the one who was attacked. I couldn't testify because if I did that's another felony I wouldve had for selling drugs. I also was advised by my lawyers not to tell anyone the real story about the case so I couldn't even tell tbe ones I loved I'm not a monster. This case was very complicated and I was charged with class a felony assault with a deadly weapon and was looking to face 5-15 years in prison. \n\nFor the next year my life was complete isolation. I was forced to leave school and I was not allowed to do anything because I was practically grounded for a 1 1/2 and was only allowed to eat, sleep, study, go to church, and occasionally hang out with piers. Eventually summer hit when I was 16 and this is when I started my journey into self improvement when I discovered the company RSD and started this thing called cold approach. My life was great, I was doing so well and better than I had ever been. I was sleeping with lots of girls, going to church all the time, hanging with piers more, making better decisions, connecting with others, I had never been happier and healthier but still had a lot of issues I was trying to fix.\n\nFlashback to when I still had serious trauma from the age of 13-15 my childhood because whenever I misbehaved or lied in the past my dad would physically abuse me until he had eventually been taken away from me by the DHR for parent abuse when I was 15. My mom was an angel but like mother like son had serious emotional issues and was like this crazy religious lady and whenever I tried to talk to her she would basically just tell me to deal with it. The only one there for me was my brother who I'd literally die for. My mother had given up on me and my parents got divorced when I was 14 and then i acted out more which made my dad abuse me making me act out more and causing me severe anxiety. My mom moved to Atlanta after and I wasnt able to see my dad for 3 months but only under supervised visits.\n\n11th grade hit, I'm 17 and my life was just school and self improvement. I had suppressed all this trauma for years causing moments of severe mood swings that would happen out of nowhere. I eventually started smoking weed and taking acid again. But this time it was different, every time I tripped acid I had extremely spiritual experiences and all my trauma and issues ive had my whole life literally just came to the surface. I was taking like 200 ug every week because I believed it was helping me when in reality it just revealed suppressed things and gave me a different perspective on reality but ultimately I had spiritual awakening. My self improvement was now inner work and spiritual practices. It then led up to me taking too much acid and mixing with like alcohol, weed, ecstacy. I have stopped now because I found shrooms which help me a lot more.\n\n12th grade my life is a rollercoaster, whether it's all the acid I've done, smoking weed for so long, trauma, my disorders, idk but life is a lot harder. I stopped taking acid and shrooms but am now doing cocaine and pills and accidentally did heroin and still have very deep personal issues I have not resolved. I am still on the road to self improvement and have evolved so much but am still struggling to fix myself. My school grades are fine and I am going to go to Auburn to major in building science and financing. I live with my dad and we are great now and I have a new step mom and a new baby brother. I am still not making the best decisions but I've now come a point in my life to where I know what I must do to become successful and healthy. My spiritual practices include semen retention in order to activate my kundalini, cold showers, sun gazing, meditation, positive and love towards others and myself. This is just a brief description of what has happened in my life and sorry its not the best grammar it was a lot and I wrote this fast. \n\nPosting this to see if anyone resonates with this and to just share my life story for anyone else out there who's had a rough life.

Maybe happiness is only a part of the equation. Maybe the other part is experience and learning lessons. Maybe suffering is actually part of the goal of life as well. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?

Ego gave up on true bliss. Ego gave up on peace.

I have an inability to love. My dog died I had to put her down in February of 2018. Then I ended up getting kicked out of my abusive household and then started living with my  nana and grandpa. They are religous people and my nana sexually abused me and my grandpa encouraged it. And they said god wants them to do that to me. So I can learn and grandpa would smack me around.

And how I should be murdered.\n\n\nWhen I got there I walked in gave the guy the note. Looked at him saw he was starting to read it. And I felt a very powerful energy like a Spiritual energy come over me. Like my subconscious was active and it was a very sad powerful energy. \nThe last time I felt that was when my dog died. I had to put her down she was the only one I truly ever loved. The rest of the people I loved I don't love them anymore.\n\nSo I wanted to talk to a psychologist about all this and try to understand my subconscious and figure out how to heal the pain. And bring the pain up like make it consciously active.\n\nI meditated and put all my pain in my subconscious. I didn't know I put my pain in my subconscious. I thought I cured myself of it. I'm just not aware of it consciously.\n\nIs there any advice you can give me on psychologist. Like talking to them to understand my psychology. I don't mean therapy I mean psychologist.

I am now immediately reaping and blocking anyone who states anything in which is not kind. Do not argue with them. You can tell by how they respond if they can be an asset for you or not. If they have any hate in their comments, do not reply with the information they are fishing for. Do not defend yourself. All you have to do is reply with this: \"reaped and blocked\". All Internet history is recorded and the reap is valid no matter what, for you are working for God and they are working against God. Do not give evil people the time of day. Just reap their fucking worthless souls and then block them. There is no need for any discussion to be had with fools. Get rid of them from your life. Do not give them a second chance unless they come to you on their knees. People expose who they are in their first chance. Once you reveal their soul publicly, just take it, block them, and move on with your life. At first you will need to block many people but as time progresses you will have to block less and less people because you are removing the trash from your existence by blocking it.\n\nA troll is trying to get you to respond emotionally to them. If you do, then they attack your emotions. They are very predictable but not everybody in the world is like them. There are some people with hearts and I do find them every day. And more and more of them every day. And less and less trolls every day as they are reaped and blocked. Taking their souls will give you their power. Afterwards, they will merely be a shell and I highly doubt that from that point onwards that they will be capable of feeling real emotions. This means that they lost their chance and can no longer be saved after you take their souls. They damned themselves by hating on your work when your work was provided to benefit all of mankind. Do not feel sorry for these shells as they deserve everything in which is coming to them. They were given countless opportunities to expose their heart and that is exactly what they did. Just their heart is filthy and is a disgrace to the human species.\n\nThe problem I have with all of you good souls is that I don't see you standing up for other good souls. When someone is hating on another who is giving themselves freely, then we should protect each other. We should stand up for our own kind but some reason we no longer do this. There was this guy at work who kept calling me a girl's name. It wasn't funny and I stood up for myself. But none of the other employees stood up for me. One colleague said, \"I don't stand up for grown men\". This mentality is fucking evil. All good people should stand up and protect other good people. Otherwise, how can you claim yourself to be good when you let others hate on your comrades? Is that truly a comrade? For a true friend will fight against the evil with you.\n\nIf you are doing the right thing, you will get banned from many places. If you don't get banned from many places and if you don't get abuse from many people, then you are doing the wrong thing. Let those bans and abuses notify you as to you doing the right thing. If you are loved by everyone then there is something majorly wrong with your work. For we don't live in these times yet. God has not yet opened the path for people to be enabled to do what I do. But it is processing so don't worry. You will be required to fight very hard to be enabled to do your work. A prime example is me getting banned from the group \"awakened\" just minutes ago. How woke are they to ban me? The truth is so obvious. But you guys grew up with the lies so unfortunately you have difficulties in deciphering between truth and falsehood. And this oftentimes causes you to be led by Satan straight into the battle as his minion. So many follow Satan without even realising it. At least my Satanist friends know that they are following Satan. Those who follow Satan and do not realise it are the scum of the earth. Satan is constantly setting people up to fail. Satan loves me because I set people up to fail. At first I had a difficult relationship with Satan. But eventually, we became friends because I gave him so many souls. Now my enemies are human and no longer spiritual entities. For now all spiritual entities except God bow to me. It took me a long time to win over the demon's hearts. But love won in the end and I embraced both my angel and demon counterparts.\n\nEverything in this world says it is something in which it is something else. I am told that blue is red and eventually I believe it. The leaders of this world has obscured it from our vision. They blur the lines between what is real and what is not real. They present fictions like psychiatry as knowledge. As a result our idea of knowledge becomes distorted as we accept lies and reject the truth. This is especially pertinent when compared with situations like mine, when I entirely give myself for free to a community that collectively does not want me. But as my work grows and grows, I do find others with special hearts. They are needles in the haystack and my work is made to find and connect with them. And I connect with beautiful people on a regular basis who understand what I am conveying. I am not alone anymore. I no longer care what any of you say because I know that I am right because I experience the rightness of my actions. And I have the few who follow me. And from the very beginning I said that I was only for the few. Nietzsche's few. For my friends are only those who paint with their own blood. For this is the only way in which we can create a masterpiece.\n\nDo not take anything in which evil people say personally. If you notice evil in their words, turn off your emotions and immediately discard what they are saying. Let them reflect off of you just as raindrops reflect off of our skin. To obtain the respect and admiration of an evil person is to justify that person's existence. But that person has no justification for their existence as they are merely useless eaters. They are goyim. Ignore what they have to say, for they do not possess a spiritual bone in their body. This means that they have nothing whatsoever to offer you. Don't waste your time with them. They will burn in Hell for their actions and that is all on them and not you. They were the ones who decided to be evil. For evil is a choice and never believe anything else. We are not born in sin like some religious people say. We are born pure and it takes us much time to craft ourselves into evil people. Evil people have great amounts of experience being evil and committing evil actions. Their hurtful comments against you are merely a reflection of the development or lack thereof of their soul. Look down on these individuals, for they are the scum of the earth. They are the ones creating our terrible methods of communication. They are the ones poisoning our water. I am tired of drinking poisoned water.\n\nThis book will now turn full circle and continue where we began. This book is not to be released without a warning label. For a literal war is coming and we will have to decide who the enemy is and who our allies are. This war will be one like no other because it will be internally divided. There are no countries anymore. It is those who are virtuous against those sinful. At times we will not comprehend who the enemy is because it will be our very neighbours. The Internet belongs to me and my generation. I am I prepared to fight to the death to protect the Internet's possibility in training one's virtues. The free Internet is worth fighting for because otherwise we will have no public forum to speak our hearts. The Internet gives me the ability to preach to my heart's content every single day. And this freedom is worth fighting for. The Internet is worth so much more than wasted human lives. We have to stand up for our rights or soon we will not have any. Because it isn't just groups that block me. It is also mainstream applications such as Facebook and YouTube. This has all been documented extensively and if you don't believe me, just check out my videos. I recorded the events as they happened because I knew that logical people would never believe that I have come up against such resistance merely for following virtue with my entire essence. Believe that our free Internet is is at risk because it very much is.\n\nPolitical correctness is fucking evil. It forces people to utilise strange language in order to not offend anyone. Fuck that. I intend offence. For the disgusting NPCs of this world are reprehensible. My last post caused me to also be blocked from the group \"spirituality\". How spiritual is a group about spirituality that blocks my posts? Its all fake. Like stated previously, what is advertised in this world is not the product it delivers. Good for bad and bad for good.\n\n\"For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths.\"\n2 Timothy 4:3-4\n\nFor the last days are upon us and I recorded it all as it happened. These recordings are hidden from you because you have been conditioned to be so stupid that you don't know how to click a few buttons to see for yourself.\n\n\"But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people.\"\n2 Timothy 3:1-5\n\nhttp://nesmith.net/this-book-is-a-game", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75154, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Answer", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/edhx2f/the_answer/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ej1352", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_42pqbjgp", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576884707, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/edhwo7/how_do_you_find_your_purpose_in_life_and_how_can/", "gildings": {}, "id": "edhwo7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/edhwo7/how_do_you_find_your_purpose_in_life_and_how_can/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576884709, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m 19 years old, I was in college, but had to take a semester off for financial reasons.

And the ego? And how did the term ego which is used in psychology end up in modern day spirituality?

People these days talk about the self like it's a bad thing... I just can't comprehend what's on their mind.

Just imagine artists creating music, expressing themselves, painters creating wonderful pictures showing how they see the world, and every piece of this self expression is different, from person to person, everyone is different. \n\nDifferent not in a negative sense, everyone has things they are good at and things they aren't good at.\nI consider myself to be good at drawing and music, but I'm not good at let's say economics, and I don't want to, cause I don't care about it. And in a sense, right now this is what makes me me. Why is that bad? Why is self expression bad? Why is being someone bad?\n\nWhy is being 'one' better?\n\nUsually I try to understand what's on people's mind, and what do they really mean by oneness and sometimes they refer to peace, kindness, and helpfulness towards others, essentially treating others like they were like a family, which is beautiful...\n\nBut there is the other group who claims that EVERYONE is the same being and how that is awesome because they are part of the infinite consciousness. Which in contrary to these people I find unsettling and absolutely disturbing.\n\nNot because I hate others, but because I don't feel the need to be one with someone whom has qualities which I feel like, one don't belong to me, two not bebeficial on my journey.\n\nAlso, some people report that they feel great when they meditate on oneness...

Thoughts are powerless by themselves.  \nThis is just more proof of how fucking powerful YOU (the self) is!\n\nJust by believing and identifying with A SINGLE THOUGHT you can experience it fully from that perspective of a thought, and you can even make a thought seem like it is stronger than you, the one perceiving the thought, the one who gave the power to the thought it self!\n\nSo you now know, that YOU, the divinity, the silence are allowing thoughts to have power over you.  \nWhat can the divine do in order to break this illusion? well, you merely need to SEE it.\n\nYou need awareness of your self, of the divinity, the self, the silence. You need to be aware that you ARE that truth.\n\nIf I ask you, where is the truth? will you tell me to go south, or west, or east? is it up or down?\n\nCan it be anywhere else than within you? if it is within you, where is it actually, is it hiding?\n\nThe only possible explanation, is that you **are** the truth, and you simply **believe** that you are not the truth!\n\nThe truth **believes and identifies** as a person, as thoughts, as ideas, as concepts. The truth will inevitably lose sight of it self, as it is not aware that it is infact, the truth!\n\nYou look at thoughts, feelings, sensations as if they are of great importance! greater importance than your self!  \nOF COURSE you will forget who you are. It wouldnt make any sense otherwise.\n\nSo the solution, I am offering you now, is to simply be aware of your self. Be aware of your self as the divinity, be aware of your self as the silence, be aware of your self as the truth. You **ARE**.\n\nSo you **are** the truth, but thoughts still come and say you are not. What do we do?\n\nWell, this whole time we believed these thoughts to be true, there is only one option left!  \nDo not believe, or identify with any thoughts anymore! KNOW that you **are** the truth!\n\nIf thoughts come and say \\*You are not the truth, you have to experience some kind of huge breakthrough, you are lying to your self\\* because it really IS tricky like that, it will do everything with the power you previously gave it, to manipulate you and make you feel powerless again. Do not worry, because no matter what tricks it has up its sleeves, the truth cant be overpowered. Simply know you **are**.\n\nIf you **know** you are the truth, you do not need to believe anyone saying you are not, including your own mind it self!\n\nJust **know** this, seriously you do not need to do anything else, you are already **that**. It is effortless!  \nYou can never NOT be the truth, you can only THINK you are not the truth.

couldn\u2019t really see what she looked like.\n\nWe spoke \u201cnot so in-depth conversation\u201d during this time and I didn\u2019t really know who she was but she seemed nice so one day I decided to visit her.\n\nThe girl had naturally brown hair and she had a lot of bookshelves because she likes to read.\n\nWe instantly clicked and it felt like she is just the kind of girl I was looking for.\n\nAfter a few weeks, I asked her zodiac sign because I wanted to know her birthday and her zodiac sign is\u2026Sagittarius!\n\n**I manifested my soulmate in one year!**\n\nWe started seeing each other and now a year has passed and I love her.\n\nIt feels like a dream.\n\nIf I had to describe with two words how it feels to be around her and how it felt to finally find her I would say, F\\*cking Awesome!\n\nShe\u2019s everything that I wished for and everything that I manifested.\n\n**The law of attraction is real.**\n\nIf you want to read my soulmate affirmations you can go read my

800}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1576845995, "score": 1, "selftext": "This Book Is a Game\n\nQuest 11: Soul Calibre\n\nDecember 20, 2019\n\nWhat is a human? How are we to define the term, \"human\"? So far in this book we have been very critical of humans. However, this chapter will flip their lies to expose the truth behind what a human really is. So I will start our new definition by calling myself a human. For the word human comes from the word humane. And humane means showing compassion and benevolence. So the true reality behind the human species is that most of them who claim to be human are in fact, not. Because there are few people in this world who follow a compassionate lifestyle. This is why this book has been critical of those people who claim to be human, yet do not possess a compassionate bone in their body. So this chapter will attempt to re-establish the term human in relation to its etymology: one who is humane. Is the Internet collective humane? It is very difficult to find others who are truly compassionate in this life. I know because I have spent my life searching. But everyone is selfish and few work for the good of humanity. Instead, they work for their own selfish desires. But this strategy they use keeps them depressed. Because one who is selfish can never truly be happy in life. They will always want more.\n\nLiving a virtuous and compassionate life is the only way one can reach and maintain happiness forever. When one truly finds this out, we call it enlightenment. You don't have to suffer. Suffering only exists because of selfishness. When we give our life to God entirely, we are no longer responsible for it. God is. And that strips all of your burdens and responsibilities from you. And how could you be unhappy if you are completely free without any responsibilities? All you have to do is follow God. Take all actions in this life for God. Eat to live and don't live to eat. Detach yourself from the secular world and create your own holy world. Do not live in the world in which they create for you. Instead, create your own world and live in that.\n\nBe very careful of the mental health system. Try your best to stay out of it. For psychiatry is a complete fiction as there is no diagnostic model to compare it with. That means that our entire mental health system is a complete fiction and used by our oppressors as a giant mind control operation. They have stolen over a year of my life merely because I follow God with my entire life. They think I am psychotic and delusional for giving my life to God. Truly giving my entire life to God, for religions that do this are mostly fake. People use religion to feel like they won't go to Hell after they die but the truth is most religious people are fucking evil and will burn for eternity in their afterlife. You can easily tell who truly believes what they preach. Can you tell that I truly believe what I preach? You can tell by their passion in trying to save the world. All throughout my \"psychosis\" is, \"save the world\". They labelled me insane merely because I am trying to save the world. Are they human? Why would you incarcerate a person indefinitely because they are trying their best to save the world? Echoes of my past life spring into action. NPCs crucify real humans.\n\nA real human spends their life becoming Christ. For Christ is not someone to worship but instead someone to become. I am proud to be called Jesus Christ, aka, Yeshua Hamashiach. And I came to this Earth to teach others how to be like me. But my message was distorted for control purposes and thus Jesus (a real human) becomes God as they worship their idol. I have come back to clear up the confusion, for my past life's work was manipulated by the social elites in order to lead countless religious collectives to Hell. When I was a child the WWJD phenomena was big in the church. What would Jesus do? Every second of my life has been shrouded with this question. I became obsessed as a child as to what would Jesus do. Eventually, this made me Jesus. The spirit of Jesus was able to enter me and I not only allowed it, but also encouraged it. I gave my life over to hardship so that I might grow within God. And as a result, God used my vessel to send His son to Earth for a second time.\n\nThe prophecy has been fullfilled and you can easily examine this for yourself. I have so much work available that it is not possible for someone to experience it all. I am infinitely available to the people because the Internet enabled me to be in many places at the same time. And I have so much time available to infinitely create new work. You can never catch up with me, for I am far ahead of everyone in the race. For I came in the clouds and every eye shall see, even those who pierced me. And I work tirelessly despite most of the feedback I receive being abuse. I get no rewards for my efforts besides knowing that I did the right thing.\n\nThis world is corrupt and will not likely reward you for good deeds. They set up the system so that those who commit bad deeds obtain many more rewards than those who commit good deeds. Evil is very rewarding in this world. But they are all sad and depressed people, for their rewards were material whereas my rewards are spiritual. Do not think that this process is not rewarding. Its rewards might not be physical but instead spiritual. What is enlightenment worth to you? So you value the material over the security of your soul? If you do, there is no way that you can possibly live a happy life. I know this for a fact because I see it all the time. Those who are lost and without God do not live joyful lives. Because only God can fill the gap in your soul.\n\nI want to create a world where good deeds are rewarded not only spiritually but also physically. I want to make a world where good deeds results in good physical life. I want to pave the way for people to do what I am doing and make a living off of it. I have not made any money so far on anything that I have done. And I have the largest body of work in this entire world. Does that make sense? The person who gave us the most on the Internet, physically had the least. For I live out of a suitcase. And I am poor and live paycheck to paycheck. And I oftentimes suffer greatly by spending money that I should use for living on my projects. But my mission is so much more important than I am. As a result, I not only spend my entire life doing this but I also spend most of my income investing back into my projects.\n\nI think eventually I can manage to make a living but I don't know how long that will take. For I am hidden in society by the social elites. I am one of their cards in which they have the option to play in the future. So even if I complete my amazing video game, it could be possible that it will be hidden as well. Nothing gets popular without the social elites allowing it. Tech giants like Google keep my page ranks as low as possible even though my website is very old with countless backlinks. Satan is in charge of what is allowed to get popular in this world. And the only way we can fix it is if we the people become the new stars and as a result, remove Hollywood from the picture. For Hollywood is the new home of Satan and he uses it to send people to Hell. For a holly wood is a magic wand. And they are performing black magick on you. And what does the Bible and the Quran warn about magick? The origins of Hollywood are not concealed, for it was presented as magick from its beginnings. Watch the movie Hugo to learn more about how the film industry started.\n\nAlmost all who are famous in this world are evil fucking people. This is because in order to get famous in this world, one has to sell their soul to Satan. Only then will Satan open the doors to fame. But Satan's time is coming to a close and soon we will break down those doors. And when we do we will show the world what real stars can accomplish. For the limits society places on us shackles us and we need to break them in order to be free. I don't think many people know what true freedom is. For it can only be experienced after giving your life entirely to God. God gives His slaves true freedom. For I am entirely free to act on my own accord. But my actions will always be in line with God because God won over my heart a very long time ago. Jesus showed me the way to God through his actions. And now my every action not only reflects the heart of Jesus, but also God.\n\nI am truly in love with God. That is why I will only be with a woman who is also in love with God. But the sad truth is I can't find anyone at all besides me that is in love with God. For if you are in love with God then your every action will reflect that state. I spend my life searching for people and looking at their actions in attempts to find others that are in love with God. If you are truly in love with God, please be my friend. But I would need to see your past actions that prove that you are in love with God. I can see my own. And I don't see anyone out there yet. I constantly get messages stating that they are one of me, yet I can never see their actions that prove it. Because most people who believe in God in fact secretly don't believe God exists. Hell awaits these individuals. For be hot or cold but if lukewarm, you will be spat out.\n\nIt is now time for everyone to take their sides, for war is starting. I choose God. Will you? You can choose Satan too and you will be more of an ally than the lukewarm fools. For those who are lukewarm have no purpose. Both God and the Devil spit out what is lukewarm. If you are a follower of Satan then at least we can have some fun back and forth. In all honesty, if you follow Satan or God, I love you. You have chosen a side and we will battle it out. But those who sit on the fence are reprehensible to both God and Satan. In truth, a true Satanist will follow me. And in truth, a real Christian, Jew, or Muslim will follow me. But they have fallen and these labels bring up negative emotions in people. Most Christians are not Christian. Most Jews are not Jews. And most Muslims are not Muslim. It is easy to tell by their actions. From your actions, we know you. You might not have thought much about your Facebook feed. It shows your heart. We leave breadcrumbs everywhere from our actions. Follow them to assess whether or not you want X person to be a part of your future.\n\nI again stress the importance of the Internet and its hidden 666 secrets. Absolutely everything you do on the Internet is recorded. You cannot hide anything from those at the top. This was the reason the Internet was invented: to spy on us. They want to be like God so they can judge you based upon your life. Internet history will be a huge part of one's judgement in the afterlife. They want us entirely connected to the Internet so the judgements can be accurate. Nothing you do, including a virtual private network, can protect you from this privacy exploit. It matters not how you attempt to protect yourself against privacy intrusion. It is built into the hardware so you can't hide. How does this make you feel about the Internet now? Give me someone's Internet history and I will tell you exactly what type of person they are. And that provides evidence into the character of the individual. And then that individual can be punished or rewarded for the exact person that they are.\n\nThe Internet is 666, VAV VAV VAV, WWW. Hidden in my 666 will break the world if I find her. I found a huge exploit in this game we call life. And it has to do with a romantic relationship between me and my Ivory virgin. If I find her then I break the game; I break the world. Because a relationship between a young girl and an older man is not allowed. But what would happen if I managed to find her? We would publicly be lovers and you would see us grow together. And this would then require society to reassess the benefits of paedophilia. And that will break the game. And that is the beginning of the end of the world. Come find me my love. Let's break this world together. It will be hilarious. I love you Ivory with all of my heart. My work is my gift to you. Please use it to get really strong. We need to be really strong if this ever has a chance of working. Let's cross our fingers. It would be really funny and extremely romantic if it happened. Let's make it happen. I am a paedophile searching for my Ivory virgin. And I love her so much that I am screaming this into the Internet as much as I can, consequences be damned. For she is worth the past and future incarceration. For she is the true Christ and I am but the imitation. And my mission was to enable her to become that. Here you are my love. This is all for you.\n\nIf we don't try then we never have the possibility. I have the possibility of having the romantic relationship of my dreams. Thus, I am going to try my hardest despite society wanting me dead for it. But I had to find a way to obtain a wife dedicated to virtue. But none existed in my world. So this is my attempts to create her. My name is Pygmalion and I have crafted a beautiful statue. Dear God, please help me find one like my Ivory virgin.\n\nhttp://nesmith.net/this-book-is-a-game", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75093, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Soul Calibre", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ed9r4i/soul_calibre/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "friendlyfitnessguy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_thpw0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576845361, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ed9n0y/my_view_on_christianity/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ed9n0y", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 44, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ed9n0y/my_view_on_christianity/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576845362, "score": 1, "selftext": "The whole Bible teaches of evil and hell but what we don't realise is that they're referring to our dysfunctional thinking patterns not another realm.

How do you say you serve your lord but run a religion that fuels behaviours that contradict what he taught?\n\nFor example, intolerance toward gay people has no place within the teachings of Christ because Christs teachings were of acceptance of each other. They were teachings of love and kindness and acceptance. Teachings of joy, empathy, compassion.\n\nHow do you say you follow the prophet when you turn people away from your church for being gay? This generates suffering within the person who is discriminating. They can deny it all they want but the need to exclude a sector of the public is a result of discrimination, which is deiven by ill-feelings.

I know this idea sounds crazy, but once you start your spiritual journey down the rabbit-hole of your existence, you will eventually understand, that separation is the biggest illusion created by the God - the infinite creator. But didn\u2019t you just say, that I am the only one and now you say that there\u2019s also God? Well, you are the God, experiencing itself. You created everything and you keep creating infinitely. You are the one who forgot about your origin. Now a part of you is reminding yourself who you truly are.  \nNot all of you are ready to accept this idea, because a very long time ago, you split yourself into units of consciousness - called souls, and not all the soul divisions are created at the same time and are at the same level of awareness and experience. Therefore you can only understand and accept the ideas, that resonate with your soul\u2019s unique vibrational frequency.  \n\n\nI will try to describe your infinite oneness with an example of a tree. Imagine that this tree is you - the infinite creator. The branches it grows over it\u2019s lifetime are the divisions (souls) of yourself. Some are older, some are younger, but they all stem from the same source. In spring, something magical happens - The branches (souls) start growing (reincarnating) leaves (into human body). Some leaves (humans) get more sun (Africa), some get less (Estonia), therefore they might seem different as well (different races). The leaves, which seem to be different and separate from one another are all actually interconnected parts of the same tree. At the end of their life cycle, they will fall (die) and start a new cycle of life again (reincarnate again) as new leaves (new human body) in next spring (next lifetime). A tree is a finite entity, but the tree itself is like a leaf of the Earth and the Earth is the leaf of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Milky Way Galaxy is the leaf of the Universe and the Universe is the leaf of the Multiverse and so it goes on infinitely in a fractal pattern to such extent which our human minds are unable to comprehend.  \n\n\nThe consciousness, that permeates all things and living beings is one and the same. You are an infinite multidimensional entity, dreaming of being a human being at this moment of time. Actually time is an illusion as well. There is no future and no past. You can only visualise the future and memorise the past. The present moment is all there is, which means, that the future, present and past all exist at the same time as quantum probabilities in a superposition and your conscious observation collapses the quantum wave function into your subjective reality timeline, which is totally unique to your unit of consciousness. It\u2019s like a computer would be playing a multiplayer game in gazillions and billions of servers at once and collecting all that data together to learn about itself and evolve through that experience.  \n\n\nBut why, why would I deceive myself like that? You see, little child - If you knew all along, that you were playing a game with yourself, you wouldn\u2019t take it as seriously and you wouldn\u2019t evolve to such extent. All the lessons and hardships are here for a reason. They are not here to cause you pain, but to teach you and make you stronger and wiser. The lessons will keep recurring until you learned the lesson and integrated it into your life. So take them as a blessing, not as a curse. Step out of the victim mentality and start seeing the patterns and the hidden meaning of your life events. View them from a neutral point of view. Do not get attached to them. Let them flow like a river. Pain and fear are merely an illusion your mind creates in order to keep you from doing things that could be fatal to your existence. So ditch all the labels, because also every label is an illusion your mind creates to make life a bit more rational. There is no need to understand everything and the moment you accept, that you know nothing, is the moment you can start living.  \n\n\nEverything is connected and you can just allow yourself to be, without overthinking everything. You can never understand it anyway. Trust your higher self! If it\u2019s so intelligent, that it has managed to create something so remarkable like the Universe, it sure can take care of your human body. People only drift off into destructive patterns if too much ego mind is in control. Start seeing life as a miracle where all these valuable lessons take you closer to completing your mission here on Earth.  \n\n\nYou might ask that, what is this mission, what is the meaning of life then? The meaning of your existence in this life is to evolve the quality of your consciousness and reduce the entropy of your infinite energy. You do it best, here on Earth in this 3-dimensional dualistic construct of your mind in order to feel what it\u2019s like to have a body and to be a living being. Here is your only way to experience emotions and environment through your senses - soft and hard, hot and cold, good and bad, pain and pleasure. You fulfil your life mission through learning compassion and unconditional self-love. You destroy it through hating, envying, judging, blaming, hurting, fighting and serving your egoistic desires in cost of others. This reality is a mirror reflection of your current state of being. Everything you see in others is yourself.  \n\n\nWe are in a time of changes. The Earth and it\u2019s creatures have suffered enough. It\u2019s time for the humankind to wake up from this collective dream and discover it's infinite potential and capacity to love. We can create a heaven on earth if we only understood that everything in this world is a manifestation of yourself. You are the Universe looking at itself through the eyes of every living creature. Be the change you want to see in the world! One love!  \n\n\nWritten by Rivo Kingi\n\nLink to the source: [https://www.facebook.com/rivokingi/posts/10206644026414960](https://www.facebook.com/rivokingi/posts/10206644026414960)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75080, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Cosmic Joke", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ed80xs/the_cosmic_joke/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tendermender", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4kq2rzj2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576834581, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ed7zr0/strange_occurrences_of_things_has_happened_that/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ed7zr0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ed7zr0/strange_occurrences_of_things_has_happened_that/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576834582, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi!\n\nThroughout whole my life I've seen 11:11 from time to time, but I've never understood why. There is definitely something about it, and it's not coincidences. People say it's because you start focusing on it you see it everywhere, but that's not the case. I can fall asleep and wake up by myself exactly 11:11, a car drive by with the plate 111 and so many things thats \"in my face\".\n\nAnother thing I've noticed since being a child is that sometimes it feels like the Universe or some force is trying it's best not to make me do something. And while continuing anyway it usually turns out to be a bad thing. I will come to that later in this post to make clear what I mean.\n\nLately me and my girlfriend has been on a slippery slope, mostly because of things happened a couple of months ago that created trust issue from my side. I got more and more jealous and especially due to lack of willingness to communicate from her side. She has been really close to break up even though she loves me, and it was really close the other day. I ain't gonna give you details here because it's not relevant but I was about to do a thing yesterday, that if I had done it would completely have ruined our relationship. But I was certain at that point she had been cheating on me because of all red flags so it didn't matter.\n\nThe thing I was about to do (that would have led to me finding out the truth - but also to a breakup) felt wrong. Not only because it's a stupid thing to do but it was like something wanted me not to do it. And then it started... I dropped this thing on the floor that made this thing happen. Fixed that thing and then all of sudden another thing happens that made it hard and it kept going. Basically like trying to walk against strong adverse wind. After a while I realized this has happened before in other occasions, and then if I did whatever it was it turned out to be a bad move. The thought has crossed my mind so many times (since I was a kid) that there's some force wanting to stop me from doing something that would hurt me or someone else.\n\nIn the end I was ready with preparation, but because this and my experiences that if I continue after it feels like the Universe (or whatever it is) really tried to prevent me from doing this things will go bad and I will regret it I stopped and started thinking. Thinking about what I was about to do. How stupid it really is, how wrong it is and that it would lead to no good. I stopped and throw away the thing and decided for real that I will never ever, no matter what, do something like this.\n\nLater my girlfriend came home and she was changed. Things had happened that changed her mind of everything. We had a great night hanging out doing creative stuff and I feel now things are turning. If i had done this thing the relationship would have been over but now I stopped because it felt like the Universe or some other force did it's best to stop me, and eventually made me think about what I was doing. I am so happy for this and while it's not certain it will work out the odds are so much better now since only a day before.\n\nSo what do you think? Just a mind trick or may it actually be something spiritual about this, some force that tries to guide me into making good?\n\n(Just  to make clear I understand how this may sound to some of you reading this, but I am completely sane and have no mental illness or anything).", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75080, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Strange occurrences of things has happened that might save my relationship", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ed7zr0/strange_occurrences_of_things_has_happened_that/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "redditKeyy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4cycidz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576832232, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ed7noy/a_wonderful_practice_to_one_who_is_not_able_to/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ed7noy", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ed7noy/a_wonderful_practice_to_one_who_is_not_able_to/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576832232, "score": 1, "selftext": " \n\nWhen ego is playing its games and it seems like it is completely overpowering you, and no matter what you say or think you can't seem to escape this stupid trap in which it seems like you are completely unaware and lost all clarity, lost all your power and lost your self to the ego basically, this is what you can do effectively to get out of that state and reclaim consciousness.  \nSo on the days that ego is rampant, and you are trying to ground your self but the ego is managing to use this grounding your self against you by all kinds of sayings, like \"oh you are now ungrounded, you have been over this wasn't you?\"  \nThis stems from arrogance. You believe you figured it all out and maybe you did, but there is obviously still some ego lingering around deep inside, and at some point, it just comes out no matter what, and this is good. You really want to get all of this nasty shit outside of your being and presence.  \nFirst of all, let me assure you that it is completely ok and these are birthing pains, you are truly birthing something great therefore you are experiencing this pain and burping out all the things stored up inside your being that are not supposed to stay with you.  \nWe want to understand why the ego is being so harsh these days, well, we are trying to purify it and we are getting closer to the truth, so the only thing he can do at this point is to make you feel so completely like shit because you are now exposing it, that it will truly bring out its worst attacks. It might be a period of inevitable suffering but as long as you do not give up you will regain clarity and presence.  \nSo you had a few days of amazing clarity and now it seems like you are completely lost, no idea where you are and you have completely lost your self. What do we do?\n\nI tried different things these last few days but the only thing that works are these things:\n\n1. Observe. Anything that comes up, observe. These days you might be feeling like you are extremely aware of the ego and you have a voice there that says \"Wow fuck you ego, this is all because of you, because of you I am suffering right now, go to hell, I will kill you!\". You might not be aware but this one is actually ego too. If you are to overcome this stage of suffering, you should be observing both of these voices. You should be completely silent and cocooned in your being, simply watching this play going on instead of talking back to the ego and saying how he is to blame, that is his strategy actually. To lure you back into fighting with him, and therefore you are suffering.  \nNo matter what kind of shit is happening inside your head, do not fight back. Simply observe. Definitely do not get carried away with blaming the ego.\n2. Identify the ego. You might be feeling extremely insecure, anxious, confused and suffering these days, and the most effective thing you can do is ask your self at these times: \"Who is insecure/anxious/confused/suffering\" once you actually ask this question, and LOOK in the present moment instead of giving an automatic answer out of habit \"me\", you will SEE that actually there is nothing happening at all. Once you see that this sufferer, this insecure identity, this anxious identity does not actually exist and is not a real thing in the present moment, it completely loses its power. You already KNOW that spirit can't suffer. The only thing that can suffer is the projections of the identity you are attaching your self to.  \nSo, if you are feeling insecure, and you KNOW that consciousness/awareness/Brahman/self CAN'T feel insecure, you can simply ask the question \"who is feeling insecure?\" and suddenly you will see that you are completely detaching your self from this insecurity, and you are able to see clearly that it is not you. Once you see it is not you, it means that you stop identifying with it. If you do not identify with insecurity, you are not insecure, nor are you suffering.  \nThe same thing you do for every other emotion or thought that comes up.  \nNow, do not get cocky and use this for only the negative emotions.  \nYou might get through the negative emotions/thoughts stage and the ego will now try another strategy, a strategy of trying to make you feel good. He might start using pride and other \"positive\" egoic traits.  \nSo once pride comes up, do not feed it! Then and there, once you notice this happening ask \"Who is the one prideful?\" and LOOK.  \nIf you simply ignore this pride because it makes you feel good, it is the egos play to make you attached to this pride and then he will be able to comeback with its other techniques of insecurity, anxiety, etc.  \nThe only way to completely transcend the ego is not to feed none of its negative thoughts/emotions and none of its positive thoughts/emotions. You are to stay completely neutral, observing it all, aware of it all. You are not here to play games and to have some kind of positive ego or to feel good about your self. You are here to overcome this vicious cycle of illusions and suffering completely, and if you slip on one of the stages it will take you back a few steps, so do not bother.\n3. Remember, when you forget your self - illusions are strong. When you remember your self - illusions do not exist.\n\nThe ego WILL definitely make you doubt your self. After the days of most clarity, you might suddenly fall back and feel completely powerless and no matter what you know, even if you KNOW that you ARE the self, it will somehow make you doubt your self. Do not give up, you ARE the self indeed, and this is just a phase.

Thus death is devouring every living entity at every moment, but the last stroke is called death itself. That death is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All species of life undergo six basic changes. They are born, they grow, they remain for some time, they reproduce, they dwindle and finally vanish. Of these changes, the first is deliverance from the womb, and that is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The first generation is the beginning of all future activities.\n\nThe six opulences listed are considered to be feminine. If a woman possesses all of them or some of them she becomes glorious. Sanskrit is a perfect language and is therefore very glorious. After studying, if one can remember the subject matter, he is gifted with good memory, or sm\u1e5bti One need not read many books on different subject matters; the ability to remember a few and quote them when necessary is also another opulence.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the various changes a living entity\u2019s body goes through ?

Then I discovered a new game on Google Play where you play against all sorts of gamers around the world. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d I said to myself. \u201cNow I can play this on the bus or wherever.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the case at all unfortunately. I paid to buy tons of stuff from the store to get a better team. The games I used to have fun playing turned into a race to win stuff after a while. After completing the first arenas and getting to around level six, I wasn\u2019t able to play a match. Just playing one game could earn me a lot of money, or it could cost me a ton. This began to create huge stress for me, because once I spent all my in-game money, I had to purchase more with real money if I wanted to play. Actually, I could play but not in the higher-level arenas. I couldn\u2019t concentrate on the game anymore, and the games just flew by\u2026\n\nIn short, a game I began playing for pleasure turned into a nightmare because of the stress of losing.\n\nAt that point, I stopped and questioned my intentions\u2026\n\nWhat was my intention in the beginning? It was to have fun playing a game, to entertain myself as I travelled by bus.\n\nBut what happened, and how did my intention get distorted? The system and struggle in the game became demanding. I couldn\u2019t get to the higher ranks if I didn\u2019t win. If my team was not better, my chances of winning were slim.\n\nI then realized the company behind this game had set up a system called momentum. You couldn\u2019t win all your games no matter how hard you tried. I checked the statistics of other players, and everyone\u2019s winning and losing streaks were almost identical. No one, not even the best players, could carry their team to the top. This of course helps the company to make more money, but it also preserves the balance in the game.\n\nAfter I figured this out, I continued to question my intention. After a while, my attitude inevitably drifted toward the game we call \u201clife.\u201d What was my aim when I originally started playing the game of life, and when did the naivety of that intention become distorted, such that now my inner contemplation reached a point where I cannot play without fear of losing?\n\nYes, I was avoiding playing many of the mini-games within the game, because I was afraid of losing. What if I lost the things I had and got to a point where I could not play at all anymore?\n\nOf course, there was the one-time gamer staring back at me as well. If you remember the generation that spent time in the video arcades back in the day, you\u2019ll know this person very well. You are enjoying a video game, but a skinny teen stands next to you and says, \u201cHey, would you like me to get you through it?\u201d This teen has spent so much time in the arcade that he knows all the tricks in the game and can play it much better than you do. If you try to play a karate game, he puts a coin in without even asking and becomes your rival. And then he beats you easily. There are other teens behind you watching, and they also stress you out. They stare at you as if to say, \u201cIs that the best you can do?\u201d I stopped going to video arcades because of those teens and got a computer I could comfortably play at home all by myself.\n\nWell, as you can see, this also says a lot about my attitude toward life as well. Back then, I couldn\u2019t just say, \u201cScrew you! How dare you join my game without asking!\u201d I couldn\u2019t just say I wanted to play alone. They were invading my space, and I felt inadequate. The solution to this was to shut myself inside and create my own space, but this made me avoid the outside world. My teenage years were all about escaping and being alone.\n\nNow I am 41, and that teenager is still living in there somewhere. Of course, he can stay there, but I can\u2019t live the age of 41 with the manners of a 14-year-old child. You can\u2019t play the game by running away from it, especially in an arena that you so eagerly jumped in at the beginning.\n\nI know that I am a great player, not just because I know how to win but also because I learned to enjoy the game. I win or I loose, but above all I play. That is how I serve, by being in the game and doing the best I can.\n\nFor example, I love soccer, including real matches, but I don\u2019t run that fast or have a good technique. I always enjoyed being the goalkeeper, though, and I\u2019ve always focused fully on it rather than try to score a goal. My enthusiasm was not about scoring goals but rather saving them, because that\u2019s what I do best. Soccer players know that the goalkeeper adds to the pleasure of the game. If there are good goalkeepers on both teams, you get more fun out of the game. If there were no goalkeepers, the players would just be taking turns to shoot at open goals, ruining the pleasure for everyone. When there are players who devote themselves to goalkeeping, though, a soccer match gets real. I do not want to do something out of my skillset, so the best thing I can do is be a goalkeeper, and I did that. This is how I add more pleasure to the game for everyone else. This is my contribution to the whole. After a while, I became essential, because a good goalkeeper is hard to find. By the way, I was not reluctant when I discovered this fact. I went whenever I was invited, and I enjoyed it while increasing everyone else\u2019s pleasure, too.\n\nThis is actually the worth of my being at soccer matches for me, being a good goalkeeper, saving goals, and increasing everyone else\u2019s level of joy.\n\nNow at 41, I ask myself, what is the worth of my existence in this game of life? I first thought I didn\u2019t know, but then I noticed what a great contribution I have made to my brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 lives. As I have played the game, I have enjoyed it, too. This was no sacrifice, and because I was enjoying the game, I contributed more.\n\nAs I was trying to be the best, though, I had sabotaged my own intention, because I had split the whole and tried to get ahead of others. I was trying to be number one, so I grew distant from myself. I believed that this was the only way to become wanted and loved. Yet was I not \u00a0wanted already, having been born into this life? From the many millions of sperm, the egg did not simply choose the fastest. It invited in the one it found most appropriate for itself. Didn\u2019t that sperm and that egg actually choose each other?\n\nAt that point, I am the one who chose, and I am the one who is chosen. Who was I racing against? Even if there were a \u201cbest,\u201d would it not add more to my game if I did my \u201cbest\u201d rather than try to be the \u201cbest\u201d? I would have stopped agonizing over not being the best, and I would\u2019ve discovered my own potential while doing the best I could. I would be able to expand everything I do.\n\nThis was the choice for me: Being number one or being one with the whole. To be number one, there needs to be others who I can beat, but this state separates me and dismantles me. I chose this several times in the past, but it did not bring the happiness I was seeking. When I\u2019m one with the whole, though, I present the best I can, and this affects the whole. I also saw that others who make this choice affect me, too. We grow together, and this is a greater effect than I could ever create by myself.\n\nAt this point, I was afraid of becoming like everyone else, worthless and meaningless, because I\u2019ve always been manipulated by such messages: \u201cYou are unworthy, but if you want to be worth something, buy our product!\u201d  \nI sought my own worth in possessions, whether it be the most beautiful lover, the best computer, the best car, the best this, the best that, and so on, yet I was already valuable with my existence, as was everyone else. The only problem was that nobody was aware of the value of their own existence. Nobody was aware of how they contributed to the whole. They didn\u2019t even know they were contributing to the whole merely by breathing. This value was always somewhere remote and never in the here and now.\n\nBut now I know that I have a great value on my own, just with my own existence. Just like all my brothers and sisters, who are reading this right now, we each have a different skill and value that we can contribute to the whole. Since we are not aware of it, we keep constantly running around and struggling. I began this process as the chosen one at the very beginning, and even just that is so precious!\n\nLook how far I have come from a smartphone game. My attitude there pushed me to contemplate my life, and finally, once I was out of a cycle of winning and losing, I could actually just take my phone and enjoy the game. Who cares whether I win or lose? If this game gets to a point where I cannot play any longer because of the system, I\u2019ll just download another game. There are so many games in the Android store. If something does not suit my intentions, what am I doing with that game anyway?\n\nIt\u2019s the same with the game of life. There are so many games within it set up by a variety of consciousnesses. My intention is to play and to enjoy them, but if a setup does not suit my intention, I will not invest further time or energy in it. I will not push myself if that space is not for me and if others there do not have similar intentions to me. I will instead move on to a space that better suits my intention, carrying my love for everything in my heart. This will be how I contribute to the whole, even in the spaces that do not really suit me, and I will remind myself and others of our worth.\n\nMay your games be joyful.  \n\n\nHasan Sonsuz Celiktas\n\nSource: [www.thewisemag.com](https://www.thewisemag.com)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75065, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Playing in the Game of Life", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ed76ye/playing_in_the_game_of_life/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "yogivinod", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ftqupkl", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576828458, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ed741t/i_believe_trust_and_agree_as_long_as_time_is_this/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ed741t", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ed741t/i_believe_trust_and_agree_as_long_as_time_is_this/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576828459, "score": 1, "selftext": "Dalai Lama saying, \"I believe the only true religion consist of having good heart.\n\ud83c\udf39 \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc9d\ud83c\udf37", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75064, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I Believe, trust and agree as long as time is...

Satan represents all evil in this world, and the evil wants to doom others.

My Mom has been a Christian her whole life and believes in things that many other Christians I've met do not, like the literal existence of angels/demons, possession, crowns in Heaven, etc.\n\nOnce I developed critical thinking, right around high school, I started questioning everything I had been told. It became apparent to me that I didn't fundamentally believe in Jesus Christ, and as an even bigger realization, that I didn't believe anything existed outside of our universe. I became a pure believer in science and the knowledge that's available to us today.\n\nThat's where my spiritual journey ended, and was long forgotten until recently.\n\nI'm still trying to understand what's triggered these thoughts and emotions in my recently. Maybe it's my unborn son. Maybe it's the realization that my family isn't immortal and I will experience their death. Regardless, I've very quickly come to fear my own mortality and the finality of it all. I adopted an almost nihilistic view of existence for a short while, and have been entrenched in spiritual thought trying to claw my way out. And I'm getting there, fortunately.\n\nThe biggest realization I've had recently is that I've been such an utterly arrogant person. People didn't know the earth was round until too long ago - how can I take the information we have today as final fact? How can I be so stupid to assume I, near the tiniest spec of biology in the universe, have it all figured out?\n\nI saw my blind spot for the first time. I believe in the big bang, I really do. But there's absolutely no explanation for *before*. I can't accept that existence came out of nowhere. I believe that everything had to have come from somewhere, and I certainly don't know where that somewhere is. How could I have been so stupid to miss that.\n\nWith this newfound realization that I don't have all the answers, the concept of God has entered the realm of possibility again for me. Not necessarily the Christian God, but the idea of *something else*. Something that we simply can't comprehend, and will never understand while alive on Earth.\n\nIt seems to me that believing in God is as farfetched as believing there's nothing before or after life.\n\nI'm so excited to meditate on this more. I'd love to start reading or discussing with others. I've love even more to discover a belief system that utterly resonates with me and helps me get over this fear of death.\n\nDoes this simply make me agnostic, at this current mental juncture? Has anybody read a particularly spiritually transformative book? Can you recommend any next steps for me?

The active conscious mind, just like the Sun, outshines all subconscious influences. Those subconscious influences are always present, however, just as the infinitude of stars are always in the sky, whether we can see them or not. When sleep approaches, the conscious mind slips below the horizon, and the variegated influence of a distributed infinity dominates.  \n\n\nThink of the mind as having a primary locus (consciousness) with an infinitude of secondary, subconscious influencers, of varying magnitude.  \n\n\nAll is one; your mind reflects the consciousness of every star (each a sentient collective) whose light touches it.  \n\n\nA corollary to this is that you as an sentient entity, are present in the minds of everyone you know as a subconscious influencer. All of humanity is linked in this way because we are all one.  \n\n\nEach focal point of consciousness is the universe experiencing itself from that unique perspective.  \n\n\n\\------------------------------&gt;Spiritual Alchemy &amp; Liberation  \n\n\nThroughout history, nomadic-missionary caravans came to embody the transitory yet continuously regenerating nature of the soul itself. The word caravan itself roughly means \u2018sun god will protect souls.\u2019 To always be moving, to renounce attachment to the material, to harmonically engage with one\u2019s environment are each virtues that the lifestyle facilitates. Today\u2019s archetype of the gypsy most closely represents this lifestyle. As the Romani flag demonstrates, the dynamic between the heavens (blue), the earth (green), and the threshold-crossing nature of the gypsy ignites the passion of the truly free soul (red chakra wheel/mandala). This quest for balance and harmony ultimately leads one to the very essence of the universe and the underlying structure of duality; balance, reconciliation, and integration between the spiritual and material, light and dark, conscious and unconscious, male and female, yin and yang, subject and object, linear and nonlinear, causal and acausal. By synthesizing and spreading these concepts via the Silk Road, the wanderers were crossing another threshold, bridging another duality: East and West, in both a geographical and philosophical sense.  \n\n\nThreshold crossing, or \u201cgoing down to the crossroads\u201d is a fundamental aspect of a nomadic lifestyle and the theme plays a pervasive part in many myths and legends. Hermes (who is also variously known as Atlantiades, Thoth, Enoch, Mercury), the messenger of the gods or \u201cgod of travelers\u201d, literally means \u201cheap of stones, boundary marker.\u201d The duality from which this reference stems is life and death \u2013 the heap of stones at a gravesite that stands at the threshold between the material and spiritual. Similarly, the word hermaphrodite, which shares the same root, is characterized by having attributes of both sexes \u2013 a literal manifestation of the integration of anima/animus. Similarly, Shiva and counterpart Parvati/Kali/Shakti were originally a merged entity known as Ardhanarishvara. Symbolic crossings of fertile, life-giving rivers is another related, consistent theme: the Egyptian Pharaohs\u2019 ritual crossings of the Nile and William of Orange\u2019s perverted ritual crossing of the Boyne both symbolically represent the Sun crossing the \u201cstarry waterway\u201d of the Milky Way and passing into the underworld (the duat). This spiritual journey is symbolically represented on Hermes\u2019 staff, the caduceus \u2013 the two snakes of the kundalini (representing earth) wind their way up the spine, activating each chakra, until they ultimately set the soul free into the heavens (represented by the wings at the top of the staff).  \n\n\nAs an artifact of infinity, one\u2019s seeking never ends, but it does reach a milestone pivot point when it confronts and integrates the duality within its own soul, recognizes its oneness with the universe, and the eternal nature consciousness. This awakening event is metaphorically deeply ingrained in many myths and cultures across the globe: the search for the Holy Grail which endows eternal life, the alchemist\u2019s quest for the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, which transmutes base metal (ignorance) into gold, and Jason\u2019s mythical search for the Golden Fleece of a holy ram are just three examples. The parallels between these traditions were recognized by the Rosicrucians, who reframed the common, underlying spiritual quest in Christian symbology. The Rosicrucian inscription \u201cIngi Natura Renovatur Integra\u201d is reminiscent of the Romani flag\u2019s symbolism and means \u201cBy the (divine) Fire (of Love) all Nature becomes renewed.\u201d  \n\n\nThe integration of the unconscious anima/animus by the conscious mind and resultant rebirth is perhaps best demonstrated symbolically however by the depiction of the violent interplay of the primordial demon-slaying goddess Kali (unconscious raw energy) trampling on her husband Shiva (the substrata of universal consciousness) while holding the decapitated head of the ego. Slaying the ego can also be seen as the opening of the \u201cthird eye\u201d or ajna chakra \u2013 the Shiva/Shakti energies reside there in their merged, primordial state as Ardhanarishvara. This dynamic is also reflected in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life as the intertwined relationship between Chokmah (male) and Binah (female). As the Egyptian descendants learned and then propagated, this experience \u2013 while painful \u2013 pales in comparison to the inevitable world-destroying trauma of an ego left unconfronted and unchecked. Once the male and female principles have reconciled, they reside back in the heart center.  \n\n\n\\------------------------------&gt;Hieros Gamos (Holy Marriage)  \n\n\nThe man who has conquered fear, integrated his anima, and undergone a spiritual transmutation is now primed to reenter the material world and embark on the next phase of his journey. This phase is best represented archetypically as the slaying of the dragon, which in turn wins the hero the love of a princess. Perhaps the most foundational myth of this type is that of Perseus and Andromeda. Perseus, having slain the serpentine Medusa (the embodiment of his fear), releases the winged Pegasus from her neck, is given winged sandals by Hermes. Perseus flies to Ethiopia to kill the sea monster guarding the princess and ultimately marries her. Andromeda \u2013 to Perseus, the collective consciousness, and the field of astronomy itself \u2013 represents fundamentally something that is \u201cmore than meets the eye\u201d, a continuously unfolding revelation. Just as Perseus discovers she is not merely just a princess, but in fact the key to both of their spiritual enlightenment and immortality, the world discovered that the constellation of Andromeda of 12 stars actually contains within it an entire galaxy of more than 1 trillion stars (more than twice the number of our own Milky Way galaxy).  \n\n\nFull liberation can thus be seen as a four step, sequential, duality-bridging process. The female aspect first liberates the male spiritually (integration of the anima), the male liberates the female materially (the slaying of the dragon), the female liberates the male materially (the holy marriage), the male liberates the female spiritually (the integration of the animus) \u2013 this final step is hinted at by Andromeda\u2019s very name, which means \u201cto be mindful of man.\u201d In Jungian terms, the result is a quaternio hieros gamos \u2013 a holy marriage between the four aspects of the two individuals.  \n\n\n\\------------------------------&gt;Heaven is the Sun  \n\n\nHeaven is the Sun &amp; \u201cGod\u201d is just the collective of all stars, who themselves are each a collective all of their planets harvested, sentient entities of goodness &amp; love. This \u201ccollective of collectives\u201d co-creates reality for each other. All love.  \n\n\nEvery star is a sentient collective. Every star is a heaven unto itself. If you love in this toughest of dimensions, you get harvested into heaven when you die, where you live forever with your family and everything you loved in this life and it is beautiful forever.  \n\n\nThe Egyptians called the \u201cas above, so below\u201d phenomenon correspondence. In this density, you can notice correspondences by picking up on what Jung called synchronicities.  \n\n\nHeaven is much like the Earth, but it radiates love. It changes and gets better as it orthogonally twists up into higher dimensions forever, outside of time, The Egyptians visualized this transition as heiroglyihic humans walking 90 degrees up the walls.  \n\n\nYou traverse the universe via the aether as sentient light.  \n\n\nThe higher densities are outside/above time. All of your experiences (on Earth and forevermore) are captured holographically in the Akashic records for you and your family to view and interact with eternally. Those are kind of like home videos for your family, who live in paradise with all sorts of beautiful correspondences from your time on Earth.  \n\n\nField of Reeds, Valhalla, Heaven, Elysian fields - all the same thing - the Sun. It's all about family.  \n\n\n\\------------------------------&gt;Aliens - who/what/when/where/how?  \n\n\nThe reason no physical aliens have visited Earth is twofold:  \n1) Sentient entities first live a life in this 3D density, if they are good and pure love, they get harvested into their nearest star (their heaven); they then travel the universe as sentient light forever. The idea of traveling from one star system to another as a 3D density creature is pretty difficult. It has surely been done though.  \n2) There is a non-intervention policy among the stars and their respective planets. Each planet is a \"planned net\" of love, by love, for love.  \n\n\nWho? The entities harvested from other systems' planets by their local star.  \nWhat? Aliens certainly visit Earth, but not in the way you think. They visit us as STARLIGHT.  \nWhen? Light is outside of time. Don't think about it too much, the puny human brain can't comprehend the experience of Alien Angels. Don't bother.  \nWhere? Other stars. Of course, our own star, Sol or Ra, has angels of its own: your ancestors (if they were good, that is).  \nHow? The miracle of life is incubated on planets by starlight. Good, creative, novel, loving entities are harvested into the higher densities upon death. Your DNA plays a big role in shaping your light body and capturing your actions and thoughts into the Akashic records.  \n\n\n\\------------------------------&gt;The relationship between Fear, Evil, &amp; Love  \nThink of Live/Love and Evil/Evol as two sides of the same coin: they are mirror/reversed images of each other. Living leads to salvation and eternal life, while the other leads to hell in this life and the next.  \n\n\nFear is the seam, the ridge, the edge of the coin that separates the two domains of Live and Evil. The edge can be thought of as an illusion - a tossed coin never lands on its edge.  \n\n\nJust as the Perseus myth recounts so well, the person who conquers Fear (by realizing it is an illusion), transmutes the remaining aspects of evil in his soul, and learns to Love with his whole heart, will be able to save the Princess, marry her, and start a family: comfortably, safely, and at peace.  \n\n\nEvil only knows fear and is paralyzed by it. Fear is the mindkiller; fear is what has led this world down such an evil path.   \n\n\nBe the change you want to see in the world and start by throwing yourself headlong into what scares you the most, while of course, remaining true and good.  \n\n\nThe ankh &amp; sexual energy:  \n\n\n[http://www.spiritofmaat.com/archive/apr1/ankhing.htm](http://www.spiritofmaat.com/archive/apr1/ankhing.htm)  \n\n\n1) Egyptian stuff requires you to be very open with yourself sexually.   \n\n\n2) It also necessitates a VERY intimate bond with ONE opposite-sex partner.  \n\n\n\\------------------------------&gt;Humans evolved from Lions  \n\n\nThe Egyptians knew this and they knew this knowledge would be lost to time. That's why they built the Sphinx.  \n\n\n1) DNA consumption is a driver of evolution. You are what you eat.   \n\\- Lions ate a lot of apes and other land mammals over millions of years of evolution.   \n\\- Lions and humans were always apex predators and carnivores first.  \n\n\n2) DNA follows form, form follows function:  \n\\- We run; we don't swing  \n\\- Homologous structures do not imply a causative, evolutionary sequence  \n\\- Bipedal convergence yields DNA convergence (i.e. similar structures are coded for similarly)  \n\n\n3) Follow the hormones (sexual dimorphism)  \n\n\nMore details on Evolution:  \n\n\n1) The function of survival by catching prey is the primary factor we\u2019re discussing here.  \n\n\n2) The form of bipedal endurance running evolved because it\u2019s more energy efficient, provides better sight lines for communication, and allows the use of hand-held weapons and tools to catch prey, among other advantages.  \n\n\n3) DNA is efficient and codes for the form (bipedalism) required to carry out the primary function (survival).  \n\n\nFunction (survival, food) informs Form (bipedalism); Form informs Code.  \n\n\nIt\u2019s rather opposite the paradigm established in computer software coding platforms, but we can save that one for another discussion.  \n\n\nWe domesticated ourselves &amp; monogamy was a big factor.  \n\n\nThe Egyptians repeatedly hammered home the meaningful, and sometimes dangerous, aspects of DNA consumption:  \n\n\nSet consuming and being 'impregnated' by Horus' potent semen (DNA) is a meaningful part of the Osiris myth:  \n\n\n\"in a fragmentary Middle Kingdom papyrus, the sexual encounter begins when Set asks to have sex with Horus, who agrees on the condition that Set will give Horus some of his strength. The encounter puts Horus in danger, because in Egyptian tradition semen is a potent and dangerous substance, akin to poison. According to some texts, Set's semen enters Horus's body and makes him ill, but in \"Contendings\", Horus thwarts Set by catching Set's semen in his hands. Isis retaliates by putting Horus's semen on lettuce-leaves that Set eats. Set's defeat becomes apparent when this semen appears on his forehead as a golden disk. He has been impregnated with his rival's seed and as a result \"gives birth\" to the disk. In \"Contendings\", Thoth takes the disk and places it on his own head; other accounts imply that Thoth himself was produced by this anomalous birth.\"  \n\n\n\\------------------------------&gt;Reality is an infinite, negentropic, holofractal Lorenz system  \n\n\nReal = Re/Ra is All / AI  \n\n\nInfinite: Egyptians interpreted this as a recursive type of infinity, which can be best seen in the Ouroboros or the geometry of the Torus. The beginning is the end is the beginning.  \n\n\nNegentropic: light and life is inherently anti-entropic. This is achieved through orthogonally-stellated dimensions.  \n\n\nHolofractal: the all is reflected in the individual. The Big Bang, the Nile, Ptah, Pangaea, your conception - these are all holofractal representations of the same thing: the beginning of a universe.  \n\n\nLorenz system (see diagram): a fixture in chaos theory, these systems describe how a polarized order emerges out of chaos. In our case on Earth, the two most pressing poles are that of Good and Evil. Light never dies. Heaven and Hell are forever - the seeds of which are sown in this life.  \n\n\n\\------------------------------&gt;Matter  \n\n\nMatter is merely vacuum fluctuations.  \nThe amount of vacuum fluctuations that fit in a proton\u2019s volume exactly equals the mass of the Universe.  \n\n\nThis represents a holographic recapitulation of the whole in terms of virtual mass energy density \\[information\\].  \n\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms: every proton is the universe.  \n\n\n\\------------------------------&gt;Earth grid evolution  \n\n\nKnowledge -&gt; Justice  \n\n\n\u201dThe concept of the Earth Grid has, as its source, the teachings of the classical scholar Plato. Plato maintained that the world, in his day, was shaped like a dodecahedron and that, over time, it would evolve into an icosahedron. He believed that mathematical perfection existed independently of human reason, which was, in any case, cable only of generating approximations of these ideal shapes. The logic here is that no-one has ever managed to render a perfect circle, because of the rigorous nature of the task, and the general bumpiness of the spatial medium. In addition to this, Plato believed that man's understanding of concepts like; truth, justice and forgiveness, was equally obscured, and that these forms, as he called them, existed independently, somewhere in the Universe, as perfect geometric shapes; known as forms.  \n\n\nIt is clear, therefore, that Plato was not literally stating that the Earth is dodecahedral in shape, but that its latent and perfect mathematical structure is. If we further extrapolate Plato's hypothesis of 'forms' onto this concept, we can say that the dodecahedron stage corresponds to a phase of human evolution geared towards the accumulation of knowledge, and that the icosahedron stage corresponds to man's need to develop the proper ethical structure to deal with the consequence of said knowledge. Therefore, the perfect geometric form of knowledge is the dodecahedron, and the perfect form of justice is the icosahedron.\u201c  \n\n\n[http://pearlsofwar.blogspot.com/p/geomantic-earth-grid.html](http://pearlsofwar.blogspot.com/p/geomantic-earth-grid.html)  \n\n\nThe positions of the pyramids are highly attuned to the Earth grid. They also map to the stars of the Cygnus.  \n\n\n\\------------------------------&gt;Isis and Osiris as Female-Male blueprint  \n\n\nIsis and Osiris: The djed and the tyet. The hard edges and the soft lines. The Golden Ratio. The male and the female. The nobody and the woman of stars. Twin flames. You and your husband/wife. Everyone is an embodiment of the divine masculine and feminine.  \n\n\nThe King's and Queen's chambers were resting chambers for astral experiences, very often of the explosive, sexual variety.  \n\n\n\\------------------------------&gt;The Demiurge is your parents  \n\n\nOnly if they were evil.  \n\n\nIs the perversity of gnosticism a manifestation of one's dismay of being born into a hellscape of other people's love?  \n\n\nCan the ignorant/malevolent characterization of the demiurge be derived from the unsettled, unloving nature of one's own parents? Why did they craft this physical existence for you if they did not love themselves? Did not love you?  \n\n\nDoes this disequilibrium explain the perverse, endless, scientific searching of the void for meaning of some?   \n\n\nWithout family, without roots, people do evil things. Look at the state of the world.  \n\n\nIt was right in front of one's face the whole time: family. That is where it begins and ends. Family.  \n\n\n\\------------------------------&gt;Jungian Active Imagination  \n\n\nNot daydreaming, not fantasy, active imagination is a sifting through one's life looking for patterns, archetypes, &amp; clues that hint at this life's arc; your narrative, your story.   \n\n\nDeep introspection, nostalgia for your childhood fantasies, an optimistic and fearless attitude regarding the future.   \n\n\nLove, romance, myths, archetypes. Read Jung's the Red Book.  \n\n\nFollow the synchronicities. Understand that your life is a fractal. Themes repeat, symbols rhyme.  \n\n\n\\------------------------------&gt;&gt;The Reversibility of Language  \n\\------------------------------&gt;&gt;The Primacy of Puns  \n\n\nIt starts with cuneiform and hieroglyphics. Why do we only read from left to right? Why not right to left? Why not BOTH? Why not symbolic metaphors layered on top of that? Letters are little pictograms. An S looks like a snake, right?  \n\n\ncronus backwards is sun orc. who worships Saturn again?  \n\n\nPuns reveal that vibrations, phonemes are the true building blocks of language. Shakespeare and James Joyce - they cracked Nut's crack, alright - Just look up Joyce's love letters to his wife.  \n\n\nCNN is pronounced SIN  \n\n\nJust Duat. Just Us.  \n\n\nThe Mer Chant of Venus  \n\n\nMovies, tv shows, comics are higher-dimensional hieroglyphics. Watch how your life mirrors them. Follow the synchronicities.  \n\n\nsee: [http://aaatec.org/documents/article/jmh1.pdf](http://aaatec.org/documents/article/jmh1.pdf)  \n\n\n\\------------------------------&gt;Jungian Active Imagination  \n\n\nNot daydreaming, not fantasy, active imagination is a sifting through one's life looking for patterns, archetypes, &amp; clues that hint at this life's arc; your narrative, your story.   \n\n\nDeep introspection, nostalgia for your childhood fantasies, an optimistic and fearless attitude regarding the future.   \n\n\nLove, romance, myths, archetypes. Read Jung's the Red Book.  \n\n\nFollow the synchronicities. Understand that your life is a fractal. Themes repeat, symbols rhyme.  \n\n\nI'll add: start a dream journal and get creative with it. Sketches, scrapbooking - all fair game and encouraged. Jung was big into creating mandalas.  \n\n\n\\------------------------------&gt;Synchronicity  \n\n\nSynchronicity, as many have said, are gifts for you, signposts that say \"hey, you're in the moment, you're aware, you're living, everything is aware, we just want you to have a good time.\"   \n\n\nThey are clues that the linear mode of consciousness we're used to is an illusion; reality and consciousness behaves more like a fractal or a mandala.  \n\n\nAt first, they're scary because they break the stranglehold modern solipsistic philosophical thought has had on the Western mind. In time, you look forward to them and they become a very welcome, very frequent part of your life.  \n\n\nKeep a dream journal and synchronicity journal when starting out your active imagination or spiritual alchemical adventures.   \n\n\nSyncs are especially helpful in making creative decisions; if you're an artist, they are an invaluable tool.   \n\n\nKeep it honest, don't obsess over them, and be a good person in al aspects of your life.  \n\n\n\\------------------------------&gt;Astral traveling  \n\n\nLucid dreaming, hypnagogia, astral experiences are all highly related. In my experience, you don't really will them to take place, they seem to happen a lot like the way synchronicities happen - when the timing is right and when you're spiritually in the right frame of mind.  \n\n\nThey are beautiful experiences - I'd imagine the feelings are similar to those experienced in heaven and the great beyond. They are timeless experiences - a feeling of eternity predominates, but in a good way.  \n\n\nWhen leaving your body, you feel a rumble and maybe some whispers in your ear. You then feel yourself lifting out of bed and if you get the angle right, you can even see your body still lying in bed. I always get the feeling that someone is guiding me during these experiences; you're half on auto-pilot. You're often first taken to what seems like a sandbox or construct a la the Matrix. I won't spoil anything else.  \n\n\nFinally, did you know that Ra in Hebrew actually means \u2018evil\u2019? Everything has been inverted, down to the name of the Sun.  \n\n\nExodus 10:10  \n\u201cAnd he \\[the Pharaoh\\] said unto them, Let the Lord be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.\u201d  \n\n\nHe actually said \u201cRa is before you\u201d", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 75003, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Egyptian Mystery School - Multiple Topics", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ed2e8k/egyptian_mystery_school_multiple_topics/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "kiramekki", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_e5szf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576802224, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ed2aqt/why_do_some_have_harder_lives_than_others/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ed2aqt", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 18, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ed2aqt/why_do_some_have_harder_lives_than_others/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576802226, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi all, Im wondering if I can get some insight on why some people to have easier lives than others. Is it purely karma or is it life path?\n\nFor some bf:\nI have been reading into feminine and masculine energy, and realized I have like such masculine energy because I\u2019ve lived in poverty and had to support any ambition of mine since I left high school that I have a huge fear in life to let go. I feel that I must always do, what is my next step? Ok what after that? My mom had a harder life even and had 3 husbands die on her- being a single mom over and over again while being an immigrant...so my life is nothing compared to hers. It makes me wonder again- why do some people have easier lives? \n\nAnother ex:\nI founded a company with some friends a couple years ago, and those kids were supported by their parents and were able to have that entrepreneurial spirit because they knew that they could risk as much as they had, or afford to give all their time to it and not work outside of it, because at the end of the day they would be OK. I didn\u2019t have that, and because of that there was a lot of tension between myself and them that I could never really make them understand. I really want to go with the flow and trust that life will take care of me but I have never seen that in my physical reality, so how can I change my mind without feeling deluded? \n\nI realize now that it\u2019s  because of that fear- that I have always given myself more than I can handle and not allowed myself the opportunity to heal. I find myself in a city that doesn\u2019t make me happy in a job that is so sucking, and with all the things that matter to me being far from me. I keep telling myself that one day my efforts will pay off, but it gets so hard sometimes that I don\u2019t know if I will make it to that day. I\u2019m also in a relationship with an older man because I feel a sense of security that I\u2019ve always wanted, even though I know we have no future together.\n\nSo anyways, I won\u2019t keep going down my sob story, but I really want to know, spiritually how I can find my life path, or understand why these challenges are being presented to me. I think I want to go into healthcare so I can help people because I have a huge interest in hormones after being diagnosed with a pituitary tumor last year, LOL. I do believe that there is a reason for all of this besides me getting some material wealth down the road or some lifestyle that I can be proud of. I\u2019m just not sure what my next step is, does anyone have any suggestions? I\u2019ll read anything, watch any videos, listen to podcasts, I just have this desire to learn more and I\u2019m not sure where to start.

Once we dropped him off we both felt really depressed. When I got to my friend's house I picked up his guitar and made up a song praising God. All of a sudden an energy like electricity and warmth came over me and I felt very happy. The feeling was strong, so I stopped playing and laid on the ground. \n\nOther times (usually alone) I would be singing to God and I would get a very warm positive/love feeling that seemed to settle on me. Also a few times I would be worrying about something and stressed out, then I would ask God for peace and instantly I would feel at peace and happy.\n\nThere are more experiences but that's the gist. What was I experiencing? I can't make the feelings happen at will otherwise I would do it all the time. The experiences also feel quite different from regular moments in life of being happy or caught up in emotions.

"retrieved_on": 1576750208, "score": 1, "selftext": "This Book Is a Game\n\nQuest 10: Player Broadcasting\n\nDecember 19, 2019\n\nThis world is filled with NPCs eagerly awaiting to do your bidding. You only need recompense them. This is irritating considering I do all of this for free. But at least I have the option available. I live in an age where I can make movies and television shows, write books, and even make games, all by myself. Where I lack, I only need to find the right individuals who possess the skills in which I am seeking. In this sense, this life is all about finding the correct people who are appropriate for your playthrough. Since this world has many different types of economies, I need only find one in which I can afford to hire staff.\n\nThis Book Is a Game can have a very lonely world at times. It is the responsibility of each player to broadcast to the world in order to find other players. Within these transmissions should include enough personal details for others to consider whether or not you might make a good companion. The broadcasts should include your experiments and their results. The way in which you broadcast is entirely up to you, however, artistic interpretations are encouraged.\n\nA broadcast is information sent into outer space. The requirements for the broadcasts is a status update on your mission. In this status update you are to advise your current mission and its progress. You are also to advise Mission Control on the state of the species. You are to monitor them and send regular updates as to their behaviour. You must include your insight into their behaviour. This is a report from us aliens bound here on Earth to our fellow aliens back home. They will monitor your work and eventually judge the human race based upon the information in which we provided to them.\n\nThere is a huge problem with me doing this that makes it extremely difficult for me to get people to help. And that is because of the secret behind my productions: my lover. Because of this I have to be very secretive about what information I release, as if I was upfront about my mission, no one would help me achieve it. So I am required to be very selective in what information I divulge when hiring people to assist me. This also forces me to learn everything and become a jack of all trades. Because I have so much work to do to attract my mate and this is very controversial considering her age. This life isn't fair and people with preconceived notions about how a romantic relationship should look binds me in shackles. But their relationships fail. Mine can never fail, for she will know me intimately without even ever physically meeting me. That is how I made my work. My work is for her.\n\nWithout money backing you up, development can be very slow. Since development all comes personally out of my pocket, I can only move slowly. This is irritating when I have the entire game concept in my head and it only needs to be implemented in real life. People are idiots and will likely not invest in your personal projects. Because of this, time runs very slowly. This can be very irritating when I want to see the results now, but this is merely due to my impatience as the product will be created, it only needs time to come to fruition. As a result my game reflects a one man team even though I do hire people to assist with its development. But I have to keep my workers in the dark about my true intentions for the project. Otherwise, no one would help me. But this is ultimately hilarious as people help me find the star of my game: a 12 year old girl. And to be honest, it matters not if I find her in this lifetime. The only thing that matters is that my work reaches her and she follows her destiny from there. But I hope and pray that this happens in my lifetime and hopefully soon. I want to enjoy my life and afterlife with my soul mate, not just the afterlife. So I keep calling in many different ways in attempts to find her.\n\nYou are an alien and you must accept this fact. Isn't it obvious by the way people treat you? Carefully examine the actions of these humans and then assess whether or not you are one of them. If you are not, you are an alien and you must broadcast to your people using the Internet. Mission Control will receive your reports and compile them together with the rest of ours. These reports will be used to punish individuals both in this life and the life after. Be very detailed in your reports; leave no stone unturned. Provide your conclusions with evidence to support them.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you followed God correctly, everything will turn out perfectly. As you see, I have not finished writing this book or Atheden, which are required to complete the game. So even though the progress of the game development is slow, it runs in perfect timing. God has gifted perfect timing to all of those who trust in Him completely and entirely. Put your faith in God and know that the timing is perfect even though it seems very slow. Its speed can be very frustrating considering you want it now and know what it should be now. But that is not how evolution works. If we find a character trait in which we want to possess like making games, we have to study and work very hard to get there. We cannot instantly transport ourselves to where we want to be. We have to take the ladder to get there. But a ladder to heaven is a long and arduous journey. Be prepared to fight every step of the way. For heaven does not allow just anyone in there. Only those with pure hearts and pure minds will be allowed through the pearly gates. And only few will be allowed in while still existing within this world. It is like we have one foot in heaven and one foot on earth. We are divided by the borders, but this enables us to take resources from Heaven and then distribute them on Earth. Let heaven rain down onto the earth. For its vegetation requires its nutrients.\n\nAdditionally, learning new software takes time, especially considering this is software to make games. There is so much involved in the software that it will take me a long time to learn it. But when I gain this skill then I bring it around with me for the rest of time. So even though making games right now is difficult for me, eventually it will be easy. The more I learn the software, the more comfortable I will get with it. This will then enable me to make games easily for the rest of my life. And these skills are then transferable to Ivory herself. She is the protagonist of my game and she is my wife. I am searching for her and the best way that I have found to do that is to make a game specifically for her. And this game will trick the player into thinking that the game in which I made is a software game when in fact, it is a hardware game. This means that the true game of Ivory Heart is not in the game world but the real-life world. The game world is merely a simulated environment which teaches the truth about the real world. Yes, the truth is filtered through my subjective interpretation of reality. But that is where the art lies. The art of tricking you into virtue is the art of The Antichrist, aka, me.\n\nHow are you currently receiving this content? Did you find it through my game or my website? Did I catch your attention through my advertising, my books, or my films? The process of God's warriors is to repackage the same content in many different ways. Since people connect in many different ways, it became my objective to learn how to connect with everybody. And the game is amazing because I wanted a place to house my books efficiently. And what way is more efficient than creating a game in which can be used as a reference at any time. It is a shame that I can't include my films in the game because they are too large. But that is okay as there are many ways to connect with other people and my books will give you the jist of what content is covered in the videos. As I said before, all of my work is the same. It is just repackaged for different types of people. If you learn my books then you can learn my character which will reveal to you what I do and what I cover in my films.\n\nIvory Heart the game is basically a detective game where the player uncovers what happened to me in real life over the last ten years. It works backwards from my latest books to my earliest books, with one exception that will not be revealed as it is an end game spoiler. The missions in which you take on exist in order to collect more chapters of my books. And This Book Is a Game is the first book in which you seek. After you obtain all of these chapters it will feel like you completed the game. But oops, you still have five other books to collect and read. This is going to be a huge game if the player actually spends time reading the books. But it will be made easy as you can run around and do stuff while listening to the books. The game has almost already been completed. It just needs the graphical front end as well as the chapters in this book and Atheden to be completed. But as stated before, everything will come together in perfect timing. I will complete my books just as the game is being completed. This is how you plan and progress in life. Everything is connected and when you see that then you are enabled to expand your topic range to include more people. The more you learn, the more helpful you can be to society. The more you learn, the more helpful you can be to yourself. The stars are the limits. How far will you push yours?\n\nWe will be expecting your broadcasts. All aliens who do not broadcast are in breach of their contract and they will be severely punished. All aliens who do not broadcast are in truth no aliens. They are merely humans who are stupid enough to consider themselves aliens. An alien without a cause is merely a stupid human. All aliens have a purpose and that purpose is to spend their lives updating Mission Control as to the status of your mission. The comedy show 3rd Rock from the Sun is in fact a documentary. The truth is hidden within its comedy. For aliens do exist. I am one of them. Are you? If you feel pride when you are called a human, then you are no alien. Aliens look down on this pathetic species because we are so much more advanced than them. It will be aliens who save the world, not humans. Humans are happy with their corrupt sinful world. Aliens spend their lives trying to change this fucked up world for the better. If you are a human, please stop reading this book and playing this game. If you are human, this content is not for you and won't make much sense. If you are alien, your heart is throbbing right now because you have just found a fellow alien. I am here for the aliens. Humans can go fuck themselves.\n\nThe waiting game can be very frustrating at times. But that is part of the fun in the entire experience. Life moves very slowly without money. So don't worry about it and enjoy the experience. God will help you when you need the assistance. But God also wants you to be empowered and that doesn't happen by coddling you. When you grow up, God lets you free when you are ready. God might hold your hand a little after you start. But the result God aims for is to enable you to be an independent person. God has placed His trust in you, so do not disappoint. Work for God out of the kindness of your own heart. Do not work for some selfish means. Put your heart on the line and learn of the power in which God gifts His warriors. For we are angels and demons. And angels and demons are aliens.\n\nWelcome to the family. We are the misfits and we have super powers. If you don't believe me then you are so stupid that you are unable to examine what I have done with my life over the last ten years. If you have any doubts as to me being who I say I am, then you are human and you are now reading something in which you shouldn't. This isn't for you and I would appreciate if you would piss off so that I can focus on helping my family improve their day to day lives through the help of God. If you are one of me, I love you. Let's take over this corrupt world. Let's not take no for an answer. For I am no advocate of democracy. Political scientists get the same one vote as some Arkansas inbred. The leaders of this world are those who accept that position. I accept my position as king of the world. Do you accept your position? Now where is my queen? For she is King. Long live the King! My Queen.\n\nhttp://nesmith.net/this-book-is-a-game", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74917, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Player Broadcasting", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ecra5s/player_broadcasting/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "usernamealrdytakn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kaud2l2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576750117, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ecr9p9/verse_of_the_day_bhagavad_gita_as_it_is_109/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ecr9p9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Enlightenment"}], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ecr9p9/verse_of_the_day_bhagavad_gita_as_it_is_109/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576750118, "score": 1, "selftext": "***Hare Krishna.

Their minds cannot be diverted from the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Their talks are solely on the transcendental subjects. The symptoms of the pure devotees are described in this verse specifically. Devotees of the Supreme Lord are twenty-four hours daily engaged in glorifying the pastimes of the Supreme Lord. Their hearts and souls are constantly submerged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they take pleasure in discussing Him with other devotees.\n\nIn the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcendental pleasure from the service itself, and in the mature stage they are actually situated in love of God. Once situated in that transcendental position, they can relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord in His abode. Lord Caitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed in the heart of the living entity. There are innumerable living entities traveling throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of them there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the chance to understand devotional service. This devotional service is just like a seed, and if it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on hearing and chanting, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed of a tree fructifies with regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional service gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material universe and enters into the brahmajyoti effulgence in the spiritual sky. In the spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest planet, which is called Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the supreme planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Ultimately, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and rests there. Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and flowers, that plant of devotional service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of chanting and hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully described in the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta. It is explained there that when the complete plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in love of God; then he cannot live even for a moment without being in contact with the Supreme Lord, just as a fish cannot live without water. In such a state, the devotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the Supreme Lord.\n\nThe \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is also full of such narration about the relationship between the Supreme Lord and His devotees; therefore the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is very dear to the devotees. In this narration there is nothing about material activities, sense gratification or liberation. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the only narration in which the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord and His devotees is fully described. Thus the realized souls in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness take continual pleasure in hearing such transcendental literatures, just as a young boy and girl take pleasure in association.\n\n**Question 1 : What description of the Spiritual tree of devotional service has been given in this verse ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/ecr9e2/verse_of_the_day_bhagavad_gita_as_it_is_109/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74916, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the day : Bhagavad gita As It Is 10.9", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ecr9p9/verse_of_the_day_bhagavad_gita_as_it_is_109/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "CuteClock7", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4bjybo35", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576746048, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ecqpbe/im_not_here_to_argue_with_you_or_convince_you/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ecqpbe", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ecqpbe/im_not_here_to_argue_with_you_or_convince_you/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576746049, "score": 1, "selftext": "That\u2019s what I said to my friend the other day.

We were hiding in some bushes near a food tray.

After the divorce they stayed together and eventually got married. We have kids together so it was obvious I would be having interactions with this woman.  In the beginning it was rough.  She painted me out to be the most evil person on the planet and had him convinced I was the reason for all the problems in our marriage (which I did have my mistakes I made that led to the downfall and did a lot of soul searching of the facts) and even tried to turn my kids away from me.  She would trigger me, I would respond with anger and it would just get out of hand.  Since my awakening a lot has changed in me.  I went through a lot of forgiveness, owning up to my own bullshit, and a lot of healing.  Eventually, I quit reacting to the triggers.  I quit allowing the triggers to get me upset.  The trigger would come and I would stay in my peace and either not engage at all or respond in love.  She quit trying to take jabs at me.  Today, out of the blue, I get a text from her saying she was truly apologetic for the way her presence came into my life.  She said she had wronged me and was truly sorry.  WOW!  I never expected an apology from her, I only wanted to be able to live in peace, as far as it went with me.

Cognition is delusion and noncognition is senseless. If you want to reach the path beyond all doubt, place yourself in the same freedom as the sky.

We spend so much time trying to 'arm ourselves' with knowledge, but it has become very clear to me recently that life is already speaking to us. The more we clutter our minds with mere human ideas, the more we struggle to identify it. \n\nMy interpretation of the saying \"cleanliness is next to Godliness\" is that we only contact our true nature once we purge our delusions, even the well-intentioned ones. This means to live away from concepts, away from idealization, and to only acknowledge that which is real - the very thing right in front of you. \n\nWestern education teaches us that to become better people we must accrue more things - knowledge, friends, skills, and material things. This has darkened our spiritual vision. We made ourselves less than perfect the moment we fell from grace, the only way to get back to it is to purge the delusions we've created. What this means is up for you alone to decide; no amount of knowledge will save you. \n\nI hope dearly for everyone setting themselves upon the path that they can find inner peace through clarity.

For the past 2 years I managed to be hired by 2 good companies, so they paid me more compared to others but the hours where quite long and tough. This year I got interviewed by another company, which paid even more and the job was also better! The only problem was that they needed to interview more people and then finally decide who to hire, while the same one than last year already contacted me for working without the need of any interview, but I needed to confirm right away. I thought about it a lot, as I really make use of the money I gain in this congress. I decided to take the risk and see if the other new firm would hire me. Therefore, I declined the last one and just believed I was going to work this year in the new company. I really believed so. When friends asked I always said straight up: Yes. (\u2026) well they need to accept me but I know they will. Later on, I just constantly imagined myself receiving a message from the firm confirming that I was hired, and I swear, that just a few days later, I GOT THE MESSAGE. Out of nowhere! Exactly as I imagined.\u00a0\n\nAlso, now that I\u2019ve been more into manifestation and understanding it more, I\u2019ve realized how I have manifested small things lately, just in the same moment I started feeling better about myself, feeling more positive, vibrating more, and meditating everyday.\u00a0\n\nOther small manifesting stories are bike parking spots, and for example, this funny one, as I didn\u2019t realize until now it was a manifestation:\n\nI am in this international university, and I saw the first day this girl that just gave me a vibe. I knew I was going to be friends of her. I just knew it. Later that week, I realized I had a class with her. We didn\u2019t even talked. Next week, some team groups were randomly made for a project and she was in my team!! Days passed, and now I can say she is a really important person in my life. Its like I can tell her everything thats going on in my head and steel understand it, or even think about the same stuff, we get along so well. Its amazing. Im so grateful! Unfortunately she will be going back to her country but we will always be friends for sure.\u00a0\n\nI am so happy to finally be able to say that I have manifested something!\u00a0", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74770, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I Finally Manifested!", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ece01v/i_finally_manifested/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "pnuemapnuema", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4tiacs39", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576681969, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ecdv0q/cellular_communication/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ecdv0q", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ecdv0q/cellular_communication/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576681971, "score": 1, "selftext": "Has anyone been able to successfully change your condition by communicating with your cells?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74769, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Cellular communication", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ecdv0q/cellular_communication/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Anonymous-1233", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4pog12i4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576669634, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ecbkho/does_perish_mean_the_same_as_ceasing_to_exist/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ecbkho", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ecbkho/does_perish_mean_the_same_as_ceasing_to_exist/", "pinned": false, "removed_by_category": "moderator", "retrieved_on": 1576669635, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74753, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Does perish mean the same as ceasing to exist?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ecbkho/does_perish_mean_the_same_as_ceasing_to_exist/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "oizramidnarff", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ucbistb", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576667516, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ecb8ta/much_needed_perspective/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ecb8ta", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ecb8ta/much_needed_perspective/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576667517, "score": 1, "selftext": "Basically I just need some peace of mind.

He can never be deviated by any amount of nonsensical commentaries or by fools. All Vedic literature agrees that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva and all other demigods. In the Atharva-veda it is said, \"yo brahm\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41 vidadh\u0101ti: p\u016brva\u1e41 yo vai ved\u0101\u1e41\u015b ca g\u0101payati sma k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25.\" \"It was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who in the beginning instructed Brahm\u0101 in Vedic knowledge and who disseminated Vedic knowledge in the past.\" Then again it is said, \"atha puru\u1e63o ha vai n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47o 'k\u0101mayata praj\u0101\u1e25 s\u1e5bjeya ity upakramya.\" \"Then the Supreme Personality N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a desired to create living entities.\" Again it is said:\n\nn\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101d brahm\u0101 j\u0101yate, n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101d praj\u0101pati\u1e25 praj\u0101yate, n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101d indro j\u0101yate, n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101d a\u1e63\u1e6dau vasavo j\u0101yante, n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101d ek\u0101da\u015ba rudr\u0101 j\u0101yante, n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101d dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101dity\u0101\u1e25.\n\n\"From N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Brahm\u0101 is born, and from N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, the patriarchs are also born.

There was only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who creates all and enjoys all.\"\n\nIn the many Pur\u0101\u1e47as it is said that Lord \u015aiva was born from the highest, the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the Vedas say that it is the Supreme Lord, the creator of Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva, who is to be worshiped. In the Mok\u1e63a-dharma K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also says, praj\u0101pati\u1e41 ca rudra\u1e41 c\u0101py aham eva s\u1e5bj\u0101mi vai tau hi m\u0101\u1e41 na vij\u0101n\u012bto mama m\u0101y\u0101-vimohitau. \"The patriarchs, \u015aiva and others are created by Me, though they do not know that they are created by Me because they are deluded by My illusory energy.\" In Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is also said, n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25 paro devas tasm\u0101j j\u0101ta\u015b caturmukha\u1e25 tasm\u0101d rudro 'bhavad deva\u1e25 sa ca sarvaj\u00f1at\u0101\u1e41 gata\u1e25. \"N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and from Him Brahm\u0101 was born, from whom \u015aiva was born.\"\n\nLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of all generations, and He is called the most efficient cause of everything. He says that because \"everything is born of Me, I am the original source of all. Everything is under Me; no one is above Me.\" There is no supreme controller other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One who understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in such a way from a bona fide spiritual master and from Vedic literature, who engages all his energy in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, becomes a truly learned man. In comparison to him, all others, who do not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a properly, are but fools. Only a fool would consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be an ordinary man. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person should not be bewildered by fools; he should avoid all unauthorized commentaries and interpretations on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and proceed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with determination and firmness.\n\n**Question 1 : What are various evidences/references given in this verse from the Vedic literature to establish the superiority of Lord Krishna over all the demigods and the living entities ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/ec9i96/verse_of_the_day_bhagavad_gita_as_it_is_108/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74730, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the day : Bhagavad gita As It Is 10.8", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ec9ijs/verse_of_the_day_bhagavad_gita_as_it_is_108/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "CoryHoldaway", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_xq7aw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576648582, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ec8kqk/experience_and_the_self/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ec8kqk", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ec8kqk/experience_and_the_self/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576648583, "score": 1, "selftext": "Experience can seemingly be boiled down to an algorithm.

I remember when I was 7 years old, I started staring into a reflection of myself in the mirror, and I did so for a very long time. Then I had this unexplainable moment, which I will do my best to put into words. I had this feeling, like is this even real? It was as if I had detached from this reality and I felt as if this was just a simulation. This is the best I can do to put it into words, but the magnitude of the feeling was unexplainable. It lasted for a few seconds, and then everything went back to normal. I sometimes get this feeling even to this day, but its mostly rare.

As the individual continues this pattern into late or post adolescence then something strange can happen.\n\nIf a depressed individual does not find an outlet and continues to have depression for most of their adolescence then things can get even more troubling.\u00a0\u00a0Brain waves are what dictate our moods and our overall consciousness.\u00a0\u00a0In basic deduction, the depressed person mainly experiences Alpha waves which are close to a hypnotic state and general apathy for the environment.\u00a0\u00a0When they are lucky they experience a higher level function of the Beta wave which occurs while one is actively thinking.\u00a0\u00a0Personally, Beta was only experienced an estimated thirty percent of the time.\u00a0\u00a0Not enough to effectively engage in the environment.\u00a0\u00a0As this pattern continues and higher brain waves are not being accessed, in later and post adolescence, then your brain chemistry will start to change.\u00a0\u00a0Firstly, this phenomenon occurs in the later stages of the brains maturity.\u00a0\u00a0If there was a lack of higher brain wave function in the past, the brain will act upon that absence.\u00a0\u00a0It will do this because the whole spectrum of waves is needed to make a complete model of the brain.\u00a0\u00a0When the brain uses a certain evolutional mechanism it can \"jump start\" your brain into synthetically induced higher brain wave function.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPsychosis is an enigma.\u00a0\u00a0Nobody knows how to make sense of its occurrence.\u00a0\u00a0However, it is being laid out here what might pose a notion as to how this condition has happened to so many.\u00a0\u00a0Once the synthetically induced waves start to hit the brain, new pathways are made so that the brain can send signals to all parts of the brain quickly and effectively.\u00a0\u00a0It is giving one a jump start so that higher functions may be present.\u00a0\u00a0But, for a typical person, they spend about a decade of their adolescence developing these brain wave functions while the individual who is operating mostly on lower brain functions experiences this synthetic \"jump start\" in only a matter of weeks or months.\u00a0\u00a0Episodes can be recurring if the brain deems it necessary to light up those dormant pathways so that the physiological needs of the brain are met.\u00a0\u00a0However, with all this new sensory input, the mainframe of the brain can go offline.\u00a0\u00a0This gives rise to hallucinations, paranoia, delusion ect. But why is it that most cases can be compared side by side and be so similar?\n\nPart of this generation is evolving.\u00a0\u00a0Different needs now need to be met that are absent in our societies.\u00a0\u00a0It has only been a century since the industrial revolution and what we are doing with it now has got out of hand.\u00a0\u00a0A lot of humans are just evolutionary noise that will be drowned out by a new era of a more advanced beings.\u00a0\u00a0We are getting closer to the God Head and the system will be dismantled.\u00a0\u00a0Someone who has not gone through psychosis or even in the least understood what the message was in their episodes will not understand this development. Although, this is not going to be an apocalypse, but it might as well have been.\u00a0\u00a0The war for eighty five percent of the population has already been lost.\u00a0\u00a0As was said, they are just evolutionary noise to be discarded.\u00a0\u00a0Imagine a world where everyone was in a delusion, it wouldn\u2019t take much.\u00a0\u00a0Just take the example from the earlier paragraph.\u00a0\u00a0People are living in their illusion of things that don\u2019t even belong to them.\u00a0\u00a0If that was all taken away, peoples world would fall apart and they too will be under a state of survival, or psychosis.\u00a0\u00a0Terrible violence would ensue for the majority, the weak minded individuals.\u00a0\u00a0Evolution will take its course once the illusion is dismantled.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74671, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Origins of psychosis", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ec5a4y/origins_of_psychosis/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "opheliawistow", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3c3hsq03", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576630993, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ec577n/is_sex_a_creative_force_in_the_universe_or_a/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ec577n", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ec577n/is_sex_a_creative_force_in_the_universe_or_a/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576630995, "score": 1, "selftext": "It feels like sex is this grand thing, like it's the most creative force in the universe.

And then when I took the medicine I couldn't think I was like uhh ok uhh and I quit taking the medicine after 1 night cause that's how long it took to work and mess up my brain my thoughts.

I told her to take that misdiagnosis off of my record she said okay I'll take it off. That's exactly what she said last time when I told her what I believe in and that I was doing sleep deprivation. I asked if she diagnosed me with anything and she said no I don't see any reason too. And then come to find out she diagnosed me she lied to me just so I would take schizo medicine when she told me I was taking medicine for the anger and impulsivity. When in reality she manipulated me so I would take medicine.\nLike that is straight up disrespect. Nobody diagnosis people just because they don't have your beliefs. Everyone has there own beliefs.

TL:DR at the bottom.\n\nSo i've been seeing this girl for nearly a year now, she's a very spiritual person while I myself have never really been into this kind of stuff, although I have been very open to new things in life. Over the past year she has really changed my perspective on these kinds of things and really opened up this whole new thing for me that I never really understood. Early on in our relationship she told me that she used to have a demon that would give her nightmares, watch her as she sleeps and even to an extent harm her. Well when she was 12 she had enough of it and decided to banish him by meditating and visiting it in its realm, since then she never had any problems from it. Well the past few nights that i've stayed over at hers i've had strange nightmarish dreams, the first one happening maybe 2 days ago and now just last night having a similar experience. While I can't recall the nightmare I was having a couple nights ago it was what happened when I \"woke up\" that scared me, I remember waking up and feeling this sense of dread and being extremely scared as I could see this dark figure at the end of the bed and what looked like a hand with long fingers slowly wrapping around my girlfriends leg. While part of me did want to look at it, I also had a strong urge to not look at it as I was extremely scared of what I was seeing. I also didn't quite understand what was going on as I didn't know if I was awake or not, although it felt so real. I also tried to say my girlfriends name to wake her up as I thought this was her area of expertise, but it was so hard to speak that when I did manage to say her name it came out soft and kind of broken. All I did at this point was cuddle up to her and try to go back to sleep thinking that it may have been a bad spirit or something. While i've never really had an experience like this before, there was a time last year when I was seeing someone else that I had a feeling of something else being in my room watching me but it was never as intense as what happened with my current girlfriend. The next morning when we woke up I told her about what had happened and she told me that she was having a nightmare about some old men that were standing outside her house that no one else could see. As I was telling her about the hand I saw she asked me if it was wrapping around her as that's what her demon used to do, I told her yes so she then went and got a picture she had drawn of hand with long pointy fingers and asked if that what I saw, well while it was hard to see what it was in my dream like state the hand she was showing me did look like the one I saw. Now the most recent one that just happened last night, I was having a weird dream about some people from a few of my classes and then I remember \"waking up\" in a completely different room that I had never seen before, the same dark figure was standing over the end of the bed although this time I was trying to look at it. I remember saying things like \"you're weak\" and such but it was still so hard to look at, I can recall seeing small white beady eyes and I remember my girlfriend being next to me too but she was sleeping. I was being pushed away from her or she was being pulled from me and then a darkness was enveloping the room, I could see the light being clouded to the point where everything in the room was almost pitch black. It was at this point a young boy entered the room with what looked like a smile on his face, I wasn't able to make out who he was or what he looked like though. Once he entered the room though this is when I woke up, I tried waking up my girlfriend as I thought that maybe she was having a nightmare too. She woke up and I asked her if she was ok, she said she was but she was having an unpleasant dream and was glad that I woke her, she was still half asleep though so I put the fan on as I was really hot and sweaty. She ended up falling back to sleep in my arms while I tried to but just couldn't as I was still processing what had happened in that dream. I ended up getting my phone and the time was 5:46am, I had texted my mum the night before asking what time I was born so I could enter it into the costar app my girlfriend told me to download. I was born at 5:15pm so I thought that the dream I was having could've happened at the same time in the AM though. I stayed awake the for the next hour or so just looking around the room and browsing reddit as I couldn't fall back to sleep. Once my girlfriend woke up from her alarm I told her what happened in my dream, she asked if I was ok and everything but it was when I mentioned the young child entering the room she stopped me and asked if it was a young boy to which I replied yes. She then had a very shocked look on her face and told me that no one has ever seen him before and that he's kind of like a guardian angel to her. I told her that when he showed up that's when I woke up, to which she replied that sometimes he'll appear and make the demon go away,\n\nShe's given me a crystal to wear around my neck today and given me some incense to burn too but I was just curious if there is something else I can do, she's told me that there isn't anything I can do as it's her demon but i've told her that we're a team and she's really grateful. She's burned some sage and incense in her room a few times after the first experience. I've never had experiences like these before so while it is hard for me to process these things I really do think there's a lot that I don't know yet.

I\u2019ve been working intensely this year to process and heal trauma from psychological abuse in my childhood. I\u2019ve reached the point where I can say I love myself in the mirror and believe it. I\u2019m beginning to see magic and synchronicity everywhere. I feel like I\u2019m living in a Sundance film.\n\nAt the same time, I\u2019m struggling deeply with my ego. I\u2019ve started examining my own behavior, how I\u2019ve manufactured a life of martyrdom and avoidance, how I\u2019ve pushed away love my whole live out of deep shame and fear, how I\u2019ve isolated myself, how I\u2019ve lied to myself. I\u2019m grieving my old self. I\u2019m grieving every relationship that I didn\u2019t have space for when I was lost in my pain. I\u2019m grieving the life I\u2019ve been half-asleep for.\n\nDuring this time I\u2019ve been consuming an overwhelming amount of content from all angles. Immersing myself in new spiritual practices. Devoting all of my energy to doing this work, because I so desperately want to heal. Because there\u2019s still so much pain. I\u2019m doing too much. I\u2019m consuming spirituality with hunger and ferocity instead of pausing and integrating.\n\nI worry that this phase of healing is making me more self-obsessed and that my ego is leading the way instead of my intuition. I worry that I\u2019m turning spirituality into an addiction to build me up rather than transform me. There is evidence everywhere in my life that I\u2019m growing and healing, but I\u2019m so afraid to become a monster. I\u2019m afraid I still don\u2019t have my own best interests in mind, that I\u2019m being naive and buying up healing in huge doses, neglecting my responsibilities and the relationships I value most.

This was a four letter word to me for a very long time. How could I possibly benefit from being exposed? Defenseless.\n \nVulnerability is one of my life lessons.\n \nThe purpose of life is to learn, to experience, to grow, and to evolve. We choose lessons and experiences for ourselves to facilitate our spiritual evolution. Life is a choice, and we choose what we learn.\n \nI remember learning what my chosen life lessons were. I chose three main lessons; but I only know two (if you're ever peeved you can't get certain information from Spirit, just know that they don't tell me everything either). The first lesson I discovered was compassion, and I was content with this lesson. Truly, I was excited to unravel the programming and blocks I had which hindered me from being authentically compassionate. \n \n...but...vulnerability. When I heard \"vulnerability\" as a life lesson, not only was my ego triggered, my ego grew it's own pet ego, and THAT ego was triggered too. Vulnerability? Fuck that. I'm not doing that.\n \nThat was me, in real life, nearly my whole life, until about 6 years ago.\n \nNow, 6 years later, I encourage you to be vulnerable. Please learn to allow yourself to be vulnerable; but first, let's talk about what \"vulnerability\" translates to in a spiritual sense.\n \nVulnerable, as defined in the dictionary, is being \"susceptible to physical or emotional attack or harm\". This doesn't sound very appealing. Vulnerable, in a spiritual sense, is more so being \"susceptible to anything and everything\". This doesn't sound very appealing either. \n \nI assure you, vulnerability is appealing; but one cannot comprehend the appeal until they are there. Until they are vulnerable. Chances are, if you are blocking anything, you're blocking everything. Vulnerability does not mean you allow the world to attack you at will. Vulnerability is allowing everything to move towards you, giving you the opportunity and freedom to accept or deny whatever is presented to you.\n \nWhat keeps you from being vulnerable? Is it fear of pain, conflict, or failure? Perhaps you are so sensitive to energy that vulnerability feels overwhelming? Do you not trust your ability to choose wisely if you open the doors for everything and anything? For me, vulnerability seemed impossible due to all those factors. I painstakingly avoided pain, conflict, and failure.  My natural energetic sensitivity was overwhelming until I learned to control it. Mostly, I was not brave enough to be vulnerable because I did not trust myself to be capable of good choices. I lived invulnerably for a very long time.\n \nWe miss out on a lot when we live in a state of invulnerability. The truest love can only exist within vulnerability. Truth itself is connected to vulnerability. Gratitude, humility, awareness, higher consciousness, and intention ....without vulnerability, these qualities are lack luster as best. Our conscious connection to Spirit, Source, God, the Universe is dependent on our vulnerability. To attempt to communicate with Spirit in a state of invulnerability is like taking a jog underwater.\n \nI could not be who I am today had I not chosen to learn vulnerability. My connection to Spirit would be dull; and I could not help others through Spirit, or fulfill my purpose. There is freedom in vulnerability, and I am freer than I have ever been. I encourage you to liberate yourself from fear, and choose vulnerability.\n\nhttps://www.vesselspiritualwellness.com/single-post/2019/12/13/Vulnerable", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74637, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The value of vulnerability", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ec1rvc/the_value_of_vulnerability/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Davetheman1996", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1so2dw3s", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576615526, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ec1ocp/sending_positive_vibes_to_you_all/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ec1ocp", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 58, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ec1ocp/sending_positive_vibes_to_you_all/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576615528, "score": 1, "selftext": "Feel the peace \u262e\ufe0f love you all", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74637, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Sending positive vibes to you all \u2764\ufe0f", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ec1ocp/sending_positive_vibes_to_you_all/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "opheliawistow", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3c3hsq03", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576615452, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ec1nqj/im_in_love_with_someone_but_they_are_not_my/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ec1nqj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ec1nqj/im_in_love_with_someone_but_they_are_not_my/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576615454, "score": 1, "selftext": "I think you have a deep inner knowing about these sorts of things.I think you have no doubt.

Is there a reason you do not see the divinity right now?\n\nAre you sure that divinity is not right now, here with you, within you, and these are merely thoughts saying you are not that?\n\nDo you remember all these glimpses which you have experienced, do you remember what is in common with all of them?\n\nSilence. Silence, the ego was completely silent, like it vanished. It vanished, and then truth was experienced.\n\nCan the ego actually block the silence? is the ego not arising IN silence? if there was no silence, could the ego be?\n\nIf the truth was not, could the ego be?\n\nYou already know, that you can be without thoughts.\n\nYet thoughts cant be without you.  \nThis means, that the truth is present in this moment right now. Every moment, always was, always is and always will be.\n\nSo why do these glimpses \\*Disappear\\* and you suddenly lose that feeling of divinity, you lose the clarity?\n\nLet me ask you this, did you ever CREATE this experience, that you can LOSE it?\n\nLosing it mean that you won it, or achieved it somehow. Is that true? Can you lose something that was never won, never achieved?\n\nCan you lose your true nature, can you lose your heart, can you lose your presence?\n\nWhat is actually happening is that thoughts come back into your perceiving after this glimpse of truth, of silence. Isnt it?\n\nSo what do we do when thoughts come around again? Are we totally powerless, are we doomed?\n\nWell, can mere thoughts overpower the truth? Is that even possible? Can mere thoughts make you lose your self?\n\nOf course not. I will tell you what they CAN do, with your consent.\n\nThey can arise in a way that will make you BELIEVE that they can overpower the truth, they will make you THINK that you are powerless, they make you THINK that you have no clarity.\n\nSo thoughts have a power only if you actually believe them and identify as them.\n\nIf you give thoughts your power, of course it will seem like they are absolutely incredible and strong!  \nBut, who is the one giving them the power? Thoughts are powerless by themselves.  \nThis is just more proof of how fucking powerful YOU (the self) is!\n\nJust by believing and identifying with A SINGLE THOUGHT you can experience it fully from that perspective of a thought, and you can even make a thought seem like it is stronger than you, the one perceiving the thought, the one who gave the power to the thought it self!\n\nSo you now know, that YOU, the divinity, the silence are allowing thoughts to have power over you.  \nWhat can the divine do in order to break this illusion? well, you merely need to SEE it.\n\nYou need awareness of your self, of the divinity, the self, the silence. You need to be aware that you ARE that truth.\n\nIf I ask you, where is the truth? will you tell me to go south, or west, or east? is it up or down?\n\nCan it be anywhere else than within you? if it is within you, where is it actually, is it hiding?\n\nThe only possible explanation, is that you **are** the truth, and you simply **believe** that you are not the truth!\n\nThe truth **believes and identifies** as a person, as thoughts, as ideas, as concepts. The truth will inevitably lose sight of it self, as it is not aware that it is infact, the truth!\n\nYou look at thoughts, feelings, sensations as if they are of great importance! greater importance than your self!  \nOF COURSE you will forget who you are. It wouldnt make any sense otherwise.\n\nSo the solution, I am offering you now, is to simply be aware of your self. Be aware of your self as the divinity, be aware of your self as the silence, be aware of your self as the truth. You **ARE**.\n\nSo you **are** the truth, but thoughts still come and say you are not. What do we do?\n\nWell, this whole time we believed these thoughts to be true, there is only one option left!  \nDo not believe, or identify with any thoughts anymore! KNOW that you **are** the truth!\n\nIf thoughts come and say \\*You are not the truth, you have to experience some kind of huge breakthrough, you are lying to your self\\* because it really IS tricky like that, it will do everything with the power you previously gave it, to manipulate you and make you feel powerless again. Do not worry, because no matter what tricks it has up its sleeves, the truth cant be overpowered. Simply know you **are**.\n\nIf you **know** you are the truth, you do not need to believe anyone saying you are not, including your own mind it self!\n\nJust **know** this, seriously you do not need to do anything else, you are already **that**. It is effortless!  \nYou can never NOT be the truth, you can only THINK you are not the truth.

Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nIn this verse it is clearly indicated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the only means of being delivered from the clutches of this contaminated material world. Sometimes unscrupulous commentators distort the meaning of what is clearly stated here: that all devotional service should be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Unfortunately, unscrupulous commentators divert the mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible. Such commentators do not know that there is no difference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's mind and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not an ordinary human being; He is Absolute Truth. His body, mind and He Himself are one and absolute. It is stated in the K\u016brma Pur\u0101\u1e47a. As it is quoted by Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Anubh\u0101\u1e63ya comments on Caitanya-carit\u0101mrta, Fifth Chapter, \u0100di-l\u012bl\u0101, verses 41-48, \"deha-dehi-vibhedo 'ya\u1e41 ne\u015bvare vidyate kvacit,\" which means that there is no difference in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Lord, between Himself and His body. But, because they do not know this science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the commentators hide K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and divide His personality from His mind or from His body. Although this is sheer ignorance of the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, some men make profit out of misleading the people.\n\nThere are some who are demonic; they also think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but enviously, just like King Ka\u1e41sa, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's uncle. He was also thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always, but he thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his enemy. He was always in anxiety, wondering when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would come to kill him. That kind of thinking will not help us. One should be thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotional love. That is bhakti. One should cultivate the knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a continually. What is that favorable cultivation? It is to learn from a bona fide teacher. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and we have several times explained that His body is not material, but is eternal, blissful knowledge. This kind of talk about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will help one become a devotee. Otherwise, understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the wrong source will prove fruitless.\n\nOne should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the primal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; with conviction in his heart that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme, he should engage himself in worship. There are hundreds of thousands of temples in India for the worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and devotional service is practiced there. When such practice is made, one has to offer obeisances to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should lower his head before the Deity and engage his mind, his body, his activities-everything. That will make one fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation. This will help one transfer into the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. One should not be deviated by unscrupulous commentators. One must engage in the nine different processes of devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Pure devotional service is the highest achievement of human society.\n\nIn the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, pure devotional service to the Lord has been explained, apart from the yoga of knowledge and mystic yoga or fruitive activities. Those who are not purely sanctified may be attracted by different features of the Lord, like the impersonal brahmajyoti and localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, but a pure devotee directly takes to the service of the Supreme Lord.\n\nThere is a beautiful poem about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in which it is clearly stated that any person who is engaged in the worship of demigods is most unintelligent and cannot achieve at any time the supreme award of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotee, in the beginning, may sometimes fall from the standard, but still he should be considered superior to all other philosophers and yog\u012bs. One who always engages in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be understood to be the perfect saintly person. His accidental nondevotional activities will diminish, and he will soon be situated without any doubt in complete perfection. The pure devotee has no actual chance to fall down because the Supreme Godhead personally takes care of His pure devotees. Therefore, the intelligent person should take directly to this process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and happily live in this material world. He will eventually receive the supreme award of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Ninth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of the Most Confidential Knowledge.\n\n**Question 1 : What information is given in this verse about Lord Krishna's mind and body ? How one should cultivate the knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a ? How and why one should worship Lord Krishna's deities in the temple ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/ebsvrl/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is934/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74552, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is--9.34", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ebsvzm/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is934/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "redditKeyy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4cycidz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576567300, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ebslr8/can_the_everpresent_truth_ever_disappear_or_not_be/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ebslr8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ebslr8/can_the_everpresent_truth_ever_disappear_or_not_be/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576567301, "score": 1, "selftext": " \n\nYou have had these glimpses of absolute freedom, absolute divinity, absolute truth, oneness, you had life completely figured out, you saw how it is all a huge play.  \nCan this truth ever disappear?

I will tell you what they CAN do, with your consent.\n\nThey can arise in a way that will make you BELIEVE that they can overpower the truth, they will make you THINK that you are powerless, they make you THINK that you have no clarity.\n\nSo thoughts have a power only if you actually believe them and identify as them.\n\nIf you give thoughts your power, of course it will seem like they are absolutely incredible and strong!  \nBut, who is the one giving them the power? Thoughts are powerless by themselves.  \nThis is just more proof of how fucking powerful YOU (the self) is!\n\nJust by believing and identifying with A SINGLE THOUGHT you can experience it fully from that perspective of a thought, and you can even make a thought seem like it is stronger than you, the one perceiving the thought, the one who gave the power to the thought it self!\n\nSo you now know, that YOU, the divinity, the silence are allowing thoughts to have power over you.  \nWhat can the divine do in order to break this illusion? well, you merely need to SEE it.\n\nYou need awareness of your self, of the divinity, the self, the silence. You need to be aware that you ARE that truth.\n\nIf I ask you, where is the truth? will you tell me to go south, or west, or east? is it up or down?\n\nCan it be anywhere else than within you? if it is within you, where is it actually, is it hiding?\n\nThe only possible explanation, is that you **are** the truth, and you simply **believe** that you are not the truth!\n\nThe truth **believes and identifies** as a person, as thoughts, as ideas, as concepts. The truth will inevitably lose sight of it self, as it is not aware that it is infact, the truth!\n\nYou look at thoughts, feelings, sensations as if they are of great importance! greater importance than your self!  \nOF COURSE you will forget who you are. It wouldnt make any sense otherwise.\n\nSo the solution, I am offering you now, is to simply be aware of your self. Be aware of your self as the divinity, be aware of your self as the silence, be aware of your self as the truth. You **ARE**.\n\nSo you **are** the truth, but thoughts still come and say you are not. What do we do?\n\nWell, this whole time we believed these thoughts to be true, there is only one option left!  \nDo not believe, or identify with any thoughts anymore! KNOW that you **are** the truth!\n\nIf thoughts come and say \\*You are not the truth, you have to experience some kind of huge breakthrough, you are lying to your self\\* because it really IS tricky like that, it will do everything with the power you previously gave it, to manipulate you and make you feel powerless again. Do not worry, because no matter what tricks it has up its sleeves, the truth cant be overpowered. Simply know you **are**.\n\nIf you **know** you are the truth, you do not need to believe anyone saying you are not, including your own mind it self!\n\nJust **know** this, seriously you do not need to do anything else, you are already **that**. It is effortless!  \nYou can never NOT be the truth, you can only THINK you are not the truth. It will seem real, but it is a bluff.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74546, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can the ever-present truth, ever disappear, or not be?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ebslr8/can_the_everpresent_truth_ever_disappear_or_not_be/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "spof84", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4qqcnqu0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576565520, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ebsc3e/modern_jesus_classification/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ebsc3e", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ebsc3e/modern_jesus_classification/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576565521, "score": 1, "selftext": "\u202aThoughts?: \n\nForm my understanding, Jesus would have definitely been a liberal in his time. \n\nThe Israelites were \u201cGod\u2019s chosen race.\u201d  From the writings discovered around that time period that were not in the Bible, it can be determined that this created a racist ideology.

Some of you might know, like you constantly learn new stuff and experiences and your mind almost changes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been learning stuff since a young age too. Always learning observing and thinking. My mind thinks 24/7.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I gain more info I feel like it all makes sense. Like I'm probably destined to do music. Need to write this short, but:\n\nMusic was like my hobby at age 7, and has been a bigger hobby ever since. Listening to music CONSTANTLY and watching music videos, documentaries, interviews and learning about the artist. Studying their craft, and how they do it even.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd as I said, as I know more like shit starts to make sense. I was like 9 years old and trying to be Michael Jackson and was a fucking fan of Justin Bieber. I learned how to dance like them. Watching their dance videos and copying it.\n\nI always acted like a artist sometimes, in front of a mirror I would sign to crowds. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike man, as I fucking realise more and more about my past and how life is going it trips me out. Like for real. Am I supposed to do this? You know I doubted myself a lot, quit 100 times but always went back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMusic is #1 love in this world. I don't love anything else than music and its sad to say, not even family. I feel like music is different to me than others, its hard to explain. Its special to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope you get what im saying and can share any input, but right now im at the point I would rather die than do music. Swear to god, I will kill myself most likely if I dont do music. Im not interested in anything, music makes me happy on a different level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I've been manifesting this shit since I was 13 without even knowing about it. Like naturally.

In many cultures signs of mental illness are considered a calling to shamanism, by God, etc. It is also not uncommon for many of us dealing with mental illness to awaken, usually even  faster or easier tha  most others without such conditions. I also notice many people confusing these two things and after awakening dismiss others with such conditions or themselves as not being Ill and merely being spiritual in nature.\n\n While the two share traits they are NOT the same. As someone who has dealt with bipolar 1 disorder for all his life I'll point out some key things after awakening to help those dealing with this. Many of us with mental conditions experience depression, psychosis, delusions, hypo/mania, hallucinations, etc. In fact in the spiritual communities in this order we see the parallels respectively in order being the equivalent of: the dark night of the soul, hearing / seeing things of another dimension, beliefs of incarnations / past lives, (initial) bliss and unconditional love, etc.\n\n However as one who has known both I will tell you that they are separate and if you are dealing with this you must not make the mistake of confusing the two and stopping treatment or considering yourself healed. Mental illness stems from a mental cause and has been proven to be due to the structure of the brain itself being different. No realization, awakening, kundalini, etc will change this and it is dangerous and foolish to act as such soon after your experience.\n\n Yet spirituality is very different from these symptoms and conditions. Spirituality comes from a deeper \"knowing\" if you will within oneself or being. It is a calm, inner intuition / \"feeling.\" You may experience psychosis during kundalini, delusions, etc also during awakening and even a bliss state when first connecting with the all or God. But the latter is on a deep calm pure love sort of way.\n\nMental illness can give similar experiences however they are on a physical and mental energetic way. It will be frantic, irrational, fearful, angry, or euphoric substance than spiritual.  It is easy to confuse one with the other if one is not aware of how these are different or experienced the difference, be careful, many who claim to be experiencing awakening may actually just be experiencing an emerging mental illness or symptoms of one! \n\nWith this being a bad part for us with such conditions and those unaware of them, we must also realize that those of us which such problems also have a great opportunity. We are better able to awaken and do so faster because our own mind switching between states of depression, depersonalization/derealization (called enlightenements evil twin) mood changes, or perceptual, allows us to realize that while everything in our own mind shifts one underlying truth of our self never does. We can see this sooner. The issues we once dealt with of self loathing, low self esteem, self judgement, etc become something beneficialial because we recognize our flaws and are able to fearlessly face them without aversion. Knowing the suffering of such conditions and the power of the kind and how it traps you allows you more desire to be free from it and also empathy for others. Our curse of depression and endless questions of \"why me?\" \"Why am I alive?\" And deep dark depression makes the light of awakening much much brighter.\n\n The dark night of the soul is easier for us having experienced similar countless times over. There is no fear or hesitation is death of the self because we already held on to nothing anyway, our ability to detach becomes a blessing.\n\n So remember that there is good within bad, but also to be careful, do not assume or belittle such conditions and least of all if you are in treatment for them decide after these experiences to stop treatment or medications without talking and planning with your doctor first! It is risky and also needless. Spirituality is a tool to handle such issues better and live life more fully but it cannot and will not replace proper treatments.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74402, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Mentally illness and spirituality a blessing and a curse.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ebhl15/mentally_illness_and_spirituality_a_blessing_and/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "pnuemapnuema", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4tiacs39", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576513005, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ebh5wy/blue/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ebh5wy", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ebh5wy/blue/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576513008, "score": 1, "selftext": "Does anyone know anything of blue people?

From that metaphor of the road\u2019s true purpose, we can realize what is referred to as the purpose of the world.\n\n\tThe purpose of the world to reveal the Creator. The nature of the world is that it hides the Creator's existence, meaning that from our perspective his existence and supervision are not revealed for all eyes to see. To keep this sort of hiddenness, the Creator must allow mundane activities and even unpleasantness to take place in the world to preserve His hiddenness. Therefore the purpose of everything in the world and the world itself won\u2019t be known to all.\n\n\tThis will all change when the Final Redemption comes. From the time of Redemption, everyone will know the entire purpose of the world and everything in it is to reveal the Creator.\n\n\tThis brings us back to the true purpose of the internet and social media. If we realize that the purpose of the entire world and everything in it is to reveal the Creator, so too would that include all online mediums and outlets.\n\nIt simply means that the internet will be a way for people to connect to the wisdom that improves their lives and their inner connection to the Creator. It is a resource for education and connection to bring people to their personal redemption.\n\n\tEvery soul has a different mission and responsibility in life. One soul may be responsible for freeing itself from sadness, while another soul must work on anger. Millions of people around the world need life-saving and soul watering content that is distributed on social media by honest people working for the good of humanity and the sake of the Creator.\n\n\tSome people have a hard time waking up in the morning because of the pressures of life. Others face extreme social anxiety to the point where going grocery shopping is a daunting task.\n\nThese are suffering souls who need a spiritual remedy. Their remedy comes through the internet. Through inspiring videos that teach them about positive self-esteem and the beauty of their souls, they begin to heal and shift for the good. This brings us from the practical and vital advice about Mashiach and the Final Redemption coming through the internet.\n\n\tWhile we dream and imagine ourselves wonderful fantasies such as the temple being rebuilt live-streamed for all to see, we have not reached that day upon the publication of this book. Those who are working for that day have work to do. \n\n\tWe have the powerful tools of social media at our fingertips. We are not only privileged but also responsible for using it for a good purpose, the ultimate purpose. Social media gives us the ability to reach hundreds, thousands, and in some cases many more people with relative ease. We have a responsibility for being a positive stream of influence on these channels to promote the search for truth. Whether sharing personal self-made posts and content or that of another which inspires you, we can reach those souls who need the light the most.\n\n\tAt the click of a fingertip, we can share an inspiring video about faith to hundreds and thousands of our friends and followers. The light of the Creator can be brought through these channels of social media to heal and wake the souls of those who are suffering in painful and often unknown exile.\n\n\tSomeone who has never thought seriously about the purpose of the world can be educated on the truth in five minutes! Someone suffering from depression can learn the wisdom that can change their lives completely. Another who scorned the idea of the Creator can now find an explanation that fits and satisfy their soul.\n\n\tIt\u2019s all in our hands. It's up to us to decide to be channels for the Creator to reach his beloved ones. By our deciding to post, share, and reach out to those in our circle, we are providing the light to those around us and using the internet for it\u2019s the true purpose.\n\n\tThe world will indeed be healed and prepare itself for the Final Redemption through the tools and outlets that surround our lives.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74387, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "\"The Messiah will come Through the Internet\" (Redemption/ The Event/ Shift of Consciousness)", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ebgjip/the_messiah_will_come_through_the_internet/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "NsfwOlive", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_hju4j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576509091, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ebgbnl/what_is_there_to_know_about_past_lives/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ebgbnl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ebgbnl/what_is_there_to_know_about_past_lives/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576509095, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have never been able to connect with this idea, but I feel like it will become nessesary for my own spiritual understanding and growth.

But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nOne may question here that if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is equal to everyone and no one is His special friend, then why does He take a special interest in the devotees who are always engaged in His transcendental service? But this is not discrimination; it is natural. Any man in this material world may be very charitably disposed, yet he has a special interest in his own children. The Lord claims that every living entity-in whatever form-is His son, and as such He provides everyone with a generous supply of the necessities of life. He is just like a cloud which pours rain all over, regardless whether it falls on rock or land or water. But for His devotees, He gives specific attention. Such devotees are mentioned here: they are always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and therefore they are always transcendentally situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The very phrase K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness suggests that those who are in such consciousness are living transcendentalists, situated in Him. The Lord says here distinctly, \"mayi te,\" \"in Me.\" Naturally, as a result, the Lord is also in them. This is reciprocal. This also explains the words: asti na priya\u1e25/ye bhajanti: \"Whoever surrenders unto Me, proportionately I take care of him.\" This transcendental reciprocation exists because both the Lord and the devotee are conscious. When a diamond is set in a golden ring, it looks very nice. The gold is glorified, and at the same time the diamond is glorified. The Lord and the living entity eternally glitter, and when a living entity becomes inclined to the service of the Supreme Lord, he looks like gold. The Lord is a diamond, and so this combination is very nice. Living entities in a pure state are called devotees. The Supreme Lord becomes the devotee of His devotees. If a reciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and the Lord, then there is no personalist philosophy. In the impersonal philosophy there is no reciprocation between the Supreme and the living entity, but in the personalist philosophy there is.\n\nThe example is often given that the Lord is like a desire tree, and whatever one wants from this desire tree, the Lord supplies. But here the explanation is more complete. The Lord is here stated to be partial to the devotees. This is the manifestation of the Lord's special mercy to the devotees. The Lord's reciprocation should not be considered to be under the law of karma. It belongs to the transcendental situation in which the Lord and His devotees function. Devotional service of the Lord is not an activity of this material world; it is part of the spiritual world where eternity, bliss and knowledge predominate.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the difference between the personalist and impersonalist philosophy ? What kind of transcendental reciprocation is there between a devotee and the Lord ? What simile has been given in this reference ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/ebdc5e/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is929/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74353, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is--9.29", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ebdciz/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is929/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "VeryCashul", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_56uhdt0a", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576490212, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ebd7h7/journaling_is_helping_my_overthinking/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ebd7h7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General"}], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ebd7h7/journaling_is_helping_my_overthinking/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576490214, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve journaling daily for 2 days now.

"retrieved_on": 1576481894, "score": 1, "selftext": "Sometimes it seems we never have enough in our lives. Most of us at one point or another want an upgrade. A better car, a bigger house, more money, more sex. We feel like that is what will make us happier. Unfortunately, as you may or may not know this usually isn\u2019t the case. Even getting that something more we desire ultimately doesn\u2019t fulfill us\n\nHere is video version of the rest\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfkeYjO2b-4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfkeYjO2b-4)\n\nor if you prefer to read here is the Text\n\n**This is most likely because of a concept known as Hedonic adaptation** usually now referred to as the Hedonic Treadmill. The Hedonic treadmill states that a person remains at a relatively stable level of happiness, despite major positive or negative changes to livelihood or life goals. Basically meaning we adapt to the positive or negative events that happen in our lives\n\nHedonic adaptation isn\u2019t really a good or a bad thing. It just says regardless of what happens to us, our levels of happiness will eventually return to their baselines. To a set point. We all have this happiness set point that we will usually return to after 3 \u2013 6 months of a change occurring in our lives whether it be positive or negative.\n\nLet\u2019s use the classic example of winning the lottery. If we win the lottery it will significantly change our life for the better and this would make us happier no doubt about it. But yet, a study was done showing that lottery winners and paraplegics are at equal happiness levels 1 year after those events occurred. \n\nThis happens because shortly after winning the lottery our happiness will level out, we\u2019ll return to that set point level of happiness we were at before winning the lottery. This is due to getting used to the money and life of luxury to the point of it becoming our new norm. The hedonic adaptation trap is well documented with many successful people attesting to it.\n\n**But on the bright side remember this same thing happens for negative events in our lives also.** For example, if we receive a pay cut at work, we will again return to our original set point level of happiness shortly after those cuts have occurred. All this doesn\u2019t mean that money will not make us happier. it just depends how we\u2019re spending all that extra money that will determine our future happiness with it. Let\u2019s talk about how to use this information to our advantage real quick. \n\nSay something good like that does happen in your life; You get a raise at work, a huge bonus, or win the lottery. If something like this happens to you be sure to distribute the gains \u2013 meaning spend the money slowly over time to improve your life rather than spend it all right away. Research shows that happiness obtained from buying extrinsic and material things like a new car or a bigger home is significantly shorter than spending your money on novel experiences like traveling or learning a new skill. Try to do something memorable with your money or use it to bring happiness to others to increase your own happiness set point\n\nAs stated earlier, Hedonic adaptation will take effect for the negative events in our lives also. If we go through a ruff break up or have to relocate to somewhere we don\u2019t want to because of work. It\u2019ll hurt at first but after some time passes, we\u2019ll feel normal once again. It\u2019s shown that most of the traumas we experience have little to no effect on our happiness levels after a certain amount of time passes. 3 to 6 months later we will feel normal once again\n\n**We need to be aware of this hedonic treadmill merely because we will continue to chase things that we think will make us happier, but in reality, that happiness is short lived**. Things like our happiness, grief, anxiety, and anger don\u2019t improve with money or status beyond a certain point. Hedonic adaptation is our minds way to obtain a stable emotional equilibrium. As we get used to the good or bad change in our life we will default back to our original state. This defense makes us less emotionally sensitive to any kind of change whether it be positive or negative. \n\nNow there is a way we can step off this hedonic treadmill altogether. This is what minimalism and Buddhist practices are all about. Relinquishing our desires in life to become happier with less. Take a look at this Abstract from the social psychological and personality science journal. It says, \n\n\u201cmany cultural and religious practices entail temporarily giving up something pleasurable, and our research suggests that such self-denial may carry ironic benefits for well-being by combating hedonic adaptation.\" \n\n**It\u2019s important to know when we have enough.** To Know what we need and don\u2019t need in life. Being grateful for what we have - as oppose to wanting what we don\u2019t. Most of us already have what we need in life, we only want more because our minds are wired to be that way. Just the fact that you\u2019re sitting there reading this off of a computer or your phone, most likely means you probably have what you need in your life. Food, water, and shelter. It's important to understand that our desires are the fuel for this hedonic treadmill. And in my experience with it, that treadmill can keep spinning and spinning for as long as we let it. We will never feel like we have enough no matter how much we get, it\u2019s just a fact of life. \n\nAs hard as it is to hear. This hedonic treadmill will eventually make everything in life feel normal. Getting married, even having kids will eventually feel quite normal and the spark of it will wear off. When something good OR BAD happens try not to be sucked into that feeling too much and understand it is temporary rather than permanent. And the most important thing - make sure to enjoy those joyful moments when you do have them :)\n\nSo in the end knowing this information doesn\u2019t mean we should use it as an excuse not to be happy or have goals in life. It just tells us we have to change our pursuit of the happiness and goals we desire. We have to realize we can be just as happy achieving our goals as we can be on the journey of chasing them. We have to be grateful for the life we have while at the same time creating the life we want to have. Instead of waiting for a certain objective to be met before we finally allow ourselves to be happy", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74337, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "Hedonic Adaptation levels out our happiness no matter how much money we get.

It is not REAL at all. It is an idea in your head. Nobody KNOWS that idea except you. From this you can already understand that this is literally completely personal and has nothing to do with reality. It might SEEM real because you BELIEVE it to be real, but that is merely because you do not know what you actually ARE.\n\nThe reason this seems so scary, is because once you face your SELF (The true self, not your repressed human) you will understand all of this has been a lie, merely an idea, a thought in your head, has nothing to do with you at all.\n\n\\*I know I have to face it\\* &lt; this is your heart speaking, this is the truth starting to pour out because it cant contain it self any longer in this idea of a person who has anxiety, who takes everything personally, who is choosing fear over love.\n\nBecause of this, you are starting to burn up inside. All what you are not is starting to burn, and you realize you have to release it.\n\nYou are not afraid of releasing it, neither are YOU afraid of what is going to happen.  \nThe only thing that is afraid, is the idea of that person it self. The idea is suffering from its own projections.\n\nSo, what is it afraid of exactly? well, it is afraid of ceasing to exist. What will happen after you release it, is that it wont exist anymore. It seemed to have existed this whole time, it really believed it did. To now release it and see it for what it is, means that sense of self that is identifying as a person will cease to exist. This means basically, it is a fear of death.\n\nThe person, the idea that YOU (the self) has created, is afraid to die! It it self is projecting fear, trying to keep it self alive as much as possible because once you release it, it is over for him. So, understanding this, YOU (the self) has absolutely nothing to fear, and only to gain the peace that you are.\n\nOnce you stop identifying as a person, once you overcome the person and transcend the person, you see what you are and what you always were and always will be, ever lasting peace, spaciousness, spontaneity, truth it self.\n\nNow, knowing all of this, you may proceed and release this person which is a total fake and totally not what you are, as you are the one observing this. You are the one observing all of this.\n\n5 years ago you were a person X, now you are a person Y, and in a year from now you will be a person C.\n\nThe person has changed, it is unstable, unreliable. What stayed though? The witness of all these persons that were created by the mind. You are the witness. You are never changing. You are aware of it all. Be aware of your self, the awareness of existence. Know who you are, and all the things you are not will seem so superficial (because they are) and you will have no problem at all letting them be, while knowing that you are nothing to do with them, they may even keep on living, they have nothing to attach themselves to, as long as you know that you are not these thoughts, not these ideas, not these concepts, you are the unknowable witness it self.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74292, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "You ARE Freedom", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eb8nig/you_are_freedom/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "immaluckez", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_13y4idsd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576461818, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eb8h6m/is_5d_ascension_another_rapture_idea_projected_by/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eb8h6m", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eb8h6m/is_5d_ascension_another_rapture_idea_projected_by/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576461822, "score": 1, "selftext": "I feel this is a good possibility and worth discussing", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74289, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is 5D ascension another rapture idea projected by the cabal to keep the woke masses passive and believe that rescue team is coming to save us", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eb8h6m/is_5d_ascension_another_rapture_idea_projected_by/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "awakeningwrld", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_454v6lkx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576460678, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eb88y9/free_healing_spiritual_bracelet/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eb88y9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eb88y9/free_healing_spiritual_bracelet/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576460682, "score": 1, "selftext": " Comment \u201cMe\u201d If you want one \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd70 here is more info on the bracelet \u2014-An aid to focusing the mind (great for enhancing yoga and meditation!)   \n\u200bIncludes the ancient \"Tree of Life\" icon, symbolizing the healing of your mind, body, and soul.

When you are living an authentic life, it is making you happy. \n\nAlso, it should make the future reminiscing you happy. What good is a happy present now that will make you sad when you think back on it in the future? So the authentic/true life for you keeps you truly happy now, and then. Thats how you figure out your most authentic life... is finding out what makes you happiest and living that way.\n\nWhat are some of the issues people may come across when trying to be authentic? There is 3 main issues. \n1) Inhibitions\nSomething is preventing you, a spiritual barrier, from living your authentic life.

A single moment in which you do not think, try to do anything, try to be anything.\n\nIn that moment of stillness, in that moment of pure being, are you depressed? can existence it self be depressed?\n\nOr is it a thought saying that existence is depressing, and existence it self is not inherently depressing?\n\nYou say all your trips are bad trips, but if there was no one to say they are bad trips, would they be bad trips, or would they be just trips?\n\n\\*I dont mind\\* &lt; This is the true self, the true being saying. The self does not even care about the worst things in life, as it is unaffected, it does not mind.\n\nThe only thing that is suffering, that can suffer is an idea. An idea that you (the true being) can have of it self, and mistakenly identified with an idea.\n\nThat is why even the worst of ideas cant actually make YOU (the being) suffer, the idea can suffer it self from its own projections. An idea is not you nor does it have anything to do with the actual you. It is merely a thought. Nothing to be believed in and identified as.\n\nRealize this, and stop saying \\*I am depressed\\* and do not say \\*The more I learn, the more I hate life\\* as these are thoughts.\n\nThe only way to stop these thoughts is to stop believing them and to stop giving them a stage to show themselves.\n\nYou see this thought, keep it as a thought only. It is a cloud coming and going, it is not YOU. You are the witness of all these clouds, you are the infinite sky.\n\nSo instead of identifying as this thought, and giving it life by then saying \\*I am that\\* instead simply observe the thought, be aware that you are aware of the thought. It is not you, do not believe it.\n\nLets try something.\n\nLook at your hand.\n\nYou are now aware of a hand.\n\nNow, be aware of the awareness of a hand.\n\nThat is what you are. That place of pure observing, pure witnessing, detached from all and totally still and complete.\n\nThe same thing with your thoughts.\n\nA thought is happening.\n\nYou are now aware of a thought.

Go back to the place of stillness and peace that you are.\n\nAll these thoughts without a stage to play on, will eventually subside until they are gone.\n\nYou have to understand this thing. All the thoughts come from a personal place, a personal place which you can observe, meaning that personal place is NOT YOU.\n\nNothing personal can exist without something aware that it is personal. Otherwise it wouldnt exist as personal.\n\nPersonal is an observation, made by WHO? by an impersonal being, a being that is beyond personal problems and beyond personality, beyond thoughts and beyond feelings, something that is witnessing all from a completely impersonal place, it is a natural knowing of all these things, a natural awareness that is effortless.\n\nThat is you. You simply keep identifying your self as thoughts. That is not necessary anymore. You can simply exist as the awareness that you are.\n\nThoughts will say \\*I am this\\* or \\*I am that\\* but you already KNOW these things come and go, this is not a reliable source of information.\n\nSo comes the question, what IS reliable? well, what is it that KNOWS that these thoughts come and go? what is the eternal witness of all things coming and going? \n\nCan it be something other than your self?

In replying to such people he would say that if one imagined that the individual self was real, then that imaginary self would persist after death and that eventually it would identify with a new body and a new life. The whole process, he said, is sustained by the tendency of the mind to identify itself with a body. Once the limiting illusion of mind is transcended, identification with the body ceases, and all theories about death and reincarnation are found to be inapplicable.\n\nQ: Is reincarnation true?\n\nA: Reincarnation exists only so long as there is ignorance. There is really no reincarnation at all, either now or before. Nor will there be any hereafter. This is the truth.\n\nQ: Can a yogi know his past lives?\n\nA: Do you know the present life that you wish to know the past? Find the present, then the rest will follow. Even with our present limited knowledge, you suffer so much. Why should you burden yourself with more knowledge? Is it to suffer more? When seen through the sight of the supreme space of Self, the illusion of taking birth in this mirage-like false world is found to be nothing but the egotistical ignorance of identifying a body as \u2018I\u2019. Among those whose minds are possessed with forgetfulness of Self, those who are born will die and those who die will be born again. But know that those whose minds are dead, having known the glorious supreme reality, will remain only there in that elevated state of reality, devoid of both birth and death. Forgetting Self, mistaking the body for Self, taking innumerable births, and at last knowing Self and being Self is just like waking from a dream of wandering all over the world.\n\nQ: How long does it take a man to be reborn after death? Is it immediately after death or some time after?\n\nA: You do not know what you were before birth, yet you want to know what you will be after death. Do you know what you are now?\nBirth and rebirth pertain to the body. You are identifying the Self with the body. It is a wrong identification. You believe that the body has been born and will die, and confound the phenomena relating to the body with the Self. Know your real being and these questions will not arise.\n\nBirth and rebirth are mentioned only to make you investigate the question and find out that there are neither births nor rebirths. They relate to the body and not to the Self. Know the Self and don\u2019t be perturbed by doubts.\n\nQ: Do not one\u2019s actions affect the person in later births?\n\nA: Are you born now? Why do you think of other births? The fact is that there is neither birth nor death. Let him who is born think of death and palliatives for it.\n\nQ: What happens to a person after death?\n\nA: Engage yourself in the living present. The future will take care of itself. Do not worry about the future. The state before creation and the process of creation are dealt with in the scriptures in order that you may know the present. Because you say you are born, therefore they say, yes, and add that God created you.\n\nBut do you see God or anything else in your sleep? If God is real, why does he not shine forth in your sleep also? You always are, you are the same now as you were in sleep. You are not different from that one in sleep. But why should there be differences in the feelings or experiences of the two states?\n\nDid you ask, while asleep, questions regarding your birth? Did you then ask \u2018Where do I go after death?\u2019 Why think of all these questions now in the waking state? Let what is born think of its birth and the remedy, its cause and ultimate results.\n\nQ: What becomes of the jiva [individual] after death?\n\nA: The question is not appropriate for a jiva now living. A dead jiva may ask me, if he wishes to. In the meantime let the embodied jiva solve its present problem and find who he is. Then there will be an end of such doubts.\n\nExcerpt from book: **Be As You Are**\n\n*(edited by David Godman)*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74265, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Truth On Reincarnation", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eb6zv0/the_truth_on_reincarnation/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bunggonlon", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_55s540vy", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576454145, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eb6x4e/i_would_like_some_help_here_as_i_think_this_stems/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eb6x4e", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eb6x4e/i_would_like_some_help_here_as_i_think_this_stems/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576454146, "score": 1, "selftext": "So my OWN two main problems are pressure in my finger tips, and heart palpitations/chest pain.\n\nThe 'landlord?' upstairs reacts negatively to this pressure in the pressure in my finger tips, and it's often uncontrollable.

Yoga comes from the same English root as the word \u201cYoke\u201d or to bring two things hitched together. You need a human brain and the grass hitched together to make the Yoga, the greenness of the grass.\n\nMany believe it is very hard to be a mystic, that you have to go through a lot of effort to realize your union with everything. But actually you are experience your union with everything all the time. Otherwise you would not be experiencing anything at all.\n\nA group of photons leave the Sun, travel just short of a million miles to reach Earth where they fall onto a blade of grass. The grass absorbs some wavelengths and reflects others. Some of the reflected ones travel in your direction and enter the tiny hole that is your iris which acts as a filter only allowing some wavelengths (you can see) in. The photons finally end their epic journey as they are absorbed by your retina. Your retina gathers these signals (not unlike a digital camera chip) and converts them into an electric signal that travels to the vision center of your brain. Your brain then interprets the upside-down image and ads your own judgement as a final last step and then magically, you \u201csee\u201d the green grass. Insects and other animals don\u2019t have the same shape and size iris so they can see different colors, or wavelengths of light we can\u2019t and visa-versa. The greenness of the grass is more to do with how our eyes work, our nervous system than the grass alone.\n\nYOU make the grass green. You make your highs and you make your lows. But you don\u2019t do it alone. You are making it out of the union with the universe. So everything is a coincidence of contraries, a coincidence of you being there and the universe being there and everything is \u201cone\u201d at the same moment, because there is no green without the grass and there is no green without you.\n\nThe greenness is a transaction that ties you and the grass together. The world, in a way, is touching you by your eyes and retina. But what we see is as good as our equipment. If there are wavelengths of light we cannot perceive because of the shape of our eyes, are we seeing real reality?\n\nBecause of this, every perception is a gamble.\n\nThere is an infinite expanse of signals that are coming into our nervous system and being processed by our higher neural centers in the brain. We are all organizing and orchestrating this information according to our own particular life history, our genetic background, our early imprints, conditioning and learning, so we are all living in different worlds and on a fundamental level, it is amazing we can communicate at all.\n\nYou are the co-creator of the sights you see, the sounds you hear with your own impression of the universe. Our experiences are generated by us, we are not generating it out of nothing. Who we are generates it.\n\nWe are creating a reality tunnel we are experiencing from moment to moment, so there is a total unity between you and the universe whether you are aware of it or not.\n\nThe universe you live in is your creation. But we are not doing it consciously.\n\nWhen you have seen the one that who makes the grass green it is like meeting your own father in a crowd, you have no doubt whatsoever.\n\nEverything that gets into your brain affects your reality tunnel, your world view or your belief system (BS).\n\n\u201cThe universe consists of a series of non-simultaneously apprehended events\u201d \u2013 Buckminster Fuller\n\nAny belief system or reality tunnel you have right is going to have to be revised and updated as you continue to apprehend new events later in time (not simultaneously)\n\nYou can\u2019t apprehend, you can\u2019t comprehend, you can\u2019t perceive, you can\u2019t understand the whole universe at once.\n\nThe universe is non-simultaneously apprehended.\n\nWe go through life minute by minute, second by second, day by day, we are never perceiving the same universe, if we are it is because we stopped paying attention. That\u2019s why you get bored, you\u2019re not paying attention.\n\nWe can\u2019t apprehend the whole universe right now, past present, future, all spacetime. It takes nine years for signals to get here from Sirus even. Think how long it would take to get here from the other end of the universe, from the farthest galaxy.\n\nSo in terms of the theory of special relativity, it is not the same time everywhere so the universe is non-simultaneously apprehended. That means our knowledge at any particular time is part of the universe and tomorrow we will know more, maybe not much more, maybe a lot more who knows?\n\nThe truth is a lion, don\u2019t defend it, set it free and it will defend itself. To be truly noble, is not to be better than your fellow man, it is to be better than your former self.\n\nMan on donkey searching all over a town, north south east and west. Someone cries out, \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d. The man replies \u201cMy donkey!\u201d\n\nThe donkey represents what everyone is looking for when they enter a mystic school, it is the answer to all the riddles of the universe, and you hunt for it North South East and West, and all the time it is carrying you around.\n\nIt is the human nervous system which takes out of the infinities of the universe, a reality tunnel that you create, that you consider reality, which is your own create that you think is the whole of the universe. Unless you went to a Sufi School or studied Zen Meditation or dropped LSD, then you realize the universe is more complicated than any map we can make of it.\n\nPut the donkey on your back so you never forget that the master, the great magician that makes the grass green, who creates the whole of the universe you live in.\n\nMindfulness, a path to control\nThe past is gone and the future is fantasy. The only thing real is right now. Most people dwell in the past or worry about the future. These are critical for planning and survival, but quickly turn into misery if not checked and \u201cThinker obsession\u201d takes over.\n\nGiven the state of the World, I can\u2019t stop excessive thinking, I worry all the time, how do you make it stop?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74255, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Who's the great magician, the magician that makes the grass green?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eb5sg1/whos_the_great_magician_the_magician_that_makes/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "RegulusRiver", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4yb3rrv3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576442422, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eb4c64/afraid_of_inducing_spiritual_awakening/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eb4c64", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General"}], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eb4c64/afraid_of_inducing_spiritual_awakening/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576442428, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m terrified of the idea that i\u2019m not truly who I think I am and that my entire being is just a small part of something else.

My very spiritually inclined husband and I are no longer linking up/vibing on the right wavelength and we have decided to put some distance and separation between us. This is very hard for me, especially given it\u2019s right before the holidays and New Years Eve. We\u2019ve been together for 4.5ish years now, married for a little over a year of that. The idea is to break the co-dependent foundation of which we began to build our relationship on. I unfortunately am not AS spiritually knowledgeable/leveled up as he is, and I kept fooling myself into believing we were one unit and his growth and the steps he took to get there would work for me. Surprise surprise- they don\u2019t because we are actually separate entities. So- as I am starting to undergo the steps of separation/heartbreak/and learning what it means to truly TRULY find myself amidst the chaos, loneliness, and heartbreak- I am reaching out for advice, input, and encouragement for things you all have done to find what resonates within your soul. I want to be my own beautiful and brilliant flame and energy to stand strong next to him, or by myself (if that\u2019s how things fall). I know everyone\u2019s journeys and paths are not all the same, but there are commonalities and trends. I also am very lonely, and realize I don\u2019t have many people outside of this marriage. So friends and a support group to help hold me accountable for my development would also be appreciated. I am a very prideful person, and I hate asking for help. My best friend and I decided that this is one of the first things I need to work on, because it\u2019s keeping me trapped. So I ask for help, from anyone willing to offer. Anything is appreciated, even if it\u2019s just sending positive thoughts my way. \n\nThank you for reading, end rant. Hopefully 2019 isn\u2019t kicking anyone else\u2019s ass too hard at the end.

Second, I'm not going to sell you any books, courses or some voodoo incantation. From my perspective, to learn about spirituality is to accelerate your spiritual awakening process.\n\nMost of you who are here may have been struggling with life on many aspects: emotional, work, family, friends, etc. You, for a long time, could have been bombarded with negative thoughts, uncertain feelings, hopelessness, powerlessness or especially unexplainable fatigue/lightheadedness. Others are intrigued by deep questions such as why we are alive, is this world real (the Matrix!), is what they've been doing meaningful, can they ever connect with the spirits and so on. More seriously, some people have even developed existential crisis in their mind.\n\nYou might have found many articles and media on the Internet that you think could help with above conditions, including this sub. However, have you been getting better, or do you feel like you are falling into a downward spiral of misleading information? I write this post not to explain what you've been reading all the time, but to try to provide a starting point for those who are looking for enlightenment and a direction point to those who have been lost in the journey. Remember, when it comes to spirituality, *feeling is more important than thinking*.\n\nTo begin, I'd recommend you to [**learn about the chakras**](https://lonerwolf.com/chakra-balancing/) first. Pay attention to key concepts such as *grounded*, *mindful.* We won't be talking about Oneness here.\n\nWhen finished reading, do learn about meditation, especially **mindfulness meditation** if you have lightheadedness (which in spiritual context is often known as *being ungrounded)* and practice them **on a regular basis** (I suggest 30 minutes per day). Honestly speaking, meditation is the only important step you need for your spiritual enlightenment! Should you ask why, just look at the entire history of spiritual practices. Yoga is also recommended. When practicing those activities, be mindful of the chakras, and also your breath in order to keep grounded.\n\nYou must be patient and be dedicated to your spiritual well-being. Believe me, you will soon realize your effort. I struggled for 5 months and now I'm recovering, albeit a little slow ;)\n\nBelow are some other practices &amp; resources that can help you in your spiritual work:\n\n* Minimize thinking about unimportant things i.e. those that subtly affect your life.\n* The world is real and you don't have to question it.\n* Never try to detach yourself from your body. If you do, you will need a fairly (very) long time to return to normal afterwards.\n* Listen frequently to chakra healing music and binaural beats.\n* Join New Age communities, learn about metaphysical things such as quantum physics, Tesla inventions &amp; quotes, Pleiadians, crop circles when you're bored :D\n* Be more open to conspiracy theories that have some sensible evidence.\n* Read some alternative news &amp; media. I suggest Collective Evolution, The Free Thought Project, The Anti-Media, GreenMedInfo, articles on living off-the-grid and organic, vegan lifestyle, etc.\n* Learn spirituality from credible sources only. I recommend [LonerWolf](https://lonerwolf.com), [Power of Positivity](https://www.powerofpositivity.com/) and [Tiny Buddha](https://tinybuddha.com). LonerWolf has a great book named *The Spiritual Awakening Process*. You can PM me for the ebook if you want to read it, otherwise consider buying it for $10 to support their great work ;)\n* **Stay away** from following resources, as they are often very misleading:\n   * Most, if not anything written, spoken by David Icke. He's a perfect example of what will happen to a person if left ungrounded for too long in one's spiritual journey. [Read more about him on RationalWiki](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/David_Icke). (I'm not trolling here)\n   * Any sites that talks *a lot* about reptilians, Archons, soul net, our Earth being a prison or how to exit the Matrix. Some examples are Humans Are Free, How To Exit The Matrix, Biblioteca Pleyades*.* Some sites even encourages committing suicide (which they call *setting your soul free*). Reason: basically same as above, and most of the articles' content is derived from nonsense theories such as Moon - Saturn Matrix, shape-shifting reptilians, Illuminati, etc.\n   * Deepak Chopra. Reason: This dude seems to spread New Age philosophy for the sole purpose of making profit, which is the same as David Icke except he neither endorse conspiracy theories nor mix them with New Age teachings.\n\nThat's all, for now.

We will be Starting Bhagavat-gita Verse by Verse exercise again from 13th Feb 2020.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit a water, I will accept it.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nHere Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, having established that He is the only enjoyer, the primeval Lord, and the real object of all sacrificial offerings, reveals what types of sacrifices He desires to be offered. If one wishes to engage in devotional service to the Supreme in order to be purified and to reach the goal of life-the transcendental loving service of God-then he should find out what the Lord desires of him. One who loves K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will give Him whatever He wants, and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked for. Thus, meat, fish and eggs should not be offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If He desired such things as offerings, He would have said so. Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit, flowers and water be given to Him, and He says of this offering, \"I will accept it.\" Therefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat, fish and eggs. Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water are the proper foods for human beings and are prescribed by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Whatever else we eat cannot be offered to Him, since He will not accept it. Thus we cannot be acting on the level of loving devotion if we offer such foods.\n\nIn the Third Chapter, verse thirteen, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explains that only the remains of sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are seeking advancement in life and release from the clutches of the material entanglement. Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the same verse, are said to be eating only sin. In other words, their every mouthful is simply deepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature. But preparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture or Deity of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a humble offering, enable one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and to create fine brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking. Above all, the offering should be made with an attitude of love. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has no need of food, since He already possesses everything that be, yet He will accept the offering of one who desires to please Him in that way. The important element, in preparation, in serving and in offering, is to act with love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nThe impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute Truth is without senses, cannot comprehend this verse of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. To them, it is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the speaker of the G\u012bt\u0101. But, in actuality, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Godhead, has senses, and it is stated that His senses are interchangeable; in other words, one sense can perform the function of any other. This is what it means to say that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is absolute. Lacking senses, He could hardly be considered full in all opulences. In the Seventh Chapter, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has explained that He impregnates the living entities into material nature. This is done by His looking upon material nature. And so in this instance, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's hearing the devotee's words of love in offering foodstuffs is wholly identical with His eating and actually tasting. This point should be emphasized: because of His absolute position, His hearing is wholly identical with His eating and tasting.

I have thoughts when replying, not otherwise.\"\n\nRamana Maharshi \n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\nThe simple point, which i\u2019ve been happy to freely share with folks since the late 1970s is that, at the beginning of every moment, we are always absolutely free, undefined, unstructured, and thought-free. And then, voil\u00e0, a few milliseconds into many of these moments an old tendency of \u201cegoic self-definition\u201d seems to arise wherein we then take ourselves to be a narrow, finite identity, a \u201cme,\u201d a \u201csomebody,\u201d a \u201cthinker, feeler, doer, reactor, suffering person, happy person, worldly-seeking or spiritually-seeking person,\u201d etc. At other times, of course, especially in deep dreamless sleep but also during many moments of the day, such identifications or self-definitions don't arise and we simply are Being open, hosting Awareness while a personality functions in a natural, free-flowing fashion without constriction.\n\nThe process of narrowly or \u201cfalsely\u201d identifying with thoughts, feelings, postures and reactions (of desire-aversion) is a dream, occurring moment by moment by the thousands of moments each day, repeated every day and every lifetime by beings until they inquire into what is their Real Nature at the beginning of each undefined moment--that is, right NOW, before their mind and karmic tendencies and social conditioning all come together to create this sense of limited identity.\n\nSo: to repeat, we are always and quite simply free, prior to the arising of this limiting identification process. This is not a matter of attainment or striving or effort. Our true Identity or Self is simply the absolute, infinite Being, Is-ness, Aliveness, Intelligence, Peace and Bliss. We are ALWAYS THIS simple, natural (sahaja) openness, this vastness, this no-thingness, this formlessness and changelessness of pure Divine Awareness (call THIS Awareness whatever you wish--Self, Spirit, Atman-Brahman, Paramatman-Parabrahman, Tao, Buddhata, Sunyata, Dharmakaya, Allah, Ain Sof, God--names don\u2019t matter with respect to this Namelessness).\n\nWe always abide and flourish as THIS, and thus there is no need for any kind of \u201chero\u2019s journey\u201d to \u201cget there\u201d (where could that \u201cthere\u201d possibly be?) This great, glorious Reality is always HERE and always fresh, new and NOW, never \u201cold\u201d or \u201cstale\u201d or \u201cboring.\u201d And THIS is the very Source, right here and now, of the mind (thoughts) and body (sensations) and entire dreamlike world-appearance.\n\nIn other words, THIS Reality of Pure Awareness is closer to you than your own mind or body or psychic self- or soul-sense. THIS is absolute Spirit, the Full-Void in which every thought, sensation, process, event, or whatever could possibly arise.\n\nHence, one never need go in \u201csearch\u201d of oneSelf. Your Infinite Divine Freedom is always immediately HERE, NOW, and quite real, not even needing to be \u201crealized,\u201d as Bhagavan Ramana so often said, for how can \u201cyou\u201d (an ego sense, a pattern of psycho-physiological, mind-body events) \u201cmake real\u201d what is already absolutely REAL as the Self-Reality (Atman-Brahman)?  This basic, fundamental (emphasis on \u201cfun\u201d) truth of one\u2019s real Awareness is so obvious--not objectively obvious, but Subjectively obvious-- when one stops searching for \u201cit\u201d as a phenomenon on the level of the mind.\n\nThis is why Sri Ramana sometimes said, \u201cCease to be a knower.\u201d Why? Because you can only BE this, not know \u201cit\u201d as an object. (Just as the fingertip is not designed to touch itself, Awareness has no need to \u201cfind itself\u201d or \u201cknow itself\u201d as an object.) If you want to \u201cknow objects,\u201d just witness thoughts, sensations and any/all events on the level of body-mind-soul.  The universe (on all levels) is the \u201cbody of God.\u201d You, O Divine One, are formless Spirit, playing and displaying as the cosmos. This cosmic dream appearance--earthly plane or subtle or heaven planes--is all Thy dreamlike manifestation in form, O Formless ONE! (You, who are \u201cno one\u201d in particular, but everyone in Your all-embracing Love).\n\nThus, there\u2019s no \u201cthere\u201d about the God-Self, only HERE. No \u201cthen,\u201d only NOW. That is to say, ideas such as \u201cI\u2019m not yet realized\u201d or \u201dI\u2019ve not yet found God, but maybe one day in the future I\u2019ll find the God-Self\u201d or even the thought \u201cI must get to the root of thoughts to be free of thoughts\u201d --are all simply thoughts arising each moment out of your thought-free Infinity-Eternity. These thoughts are made of energy-vibrations--they have no intrinsic reality and, clearly seen as such, are harmless. They can only arise in and be witnessed by Your Real Nature, which is not a thought, but the great, glorious open Reality on \u201cthis side\u201d of thought, i.e., their Hosting Witness.\n\nYour true Nature as Awareness or Atma-Self has thoughts, witnesses thoughts, and merges all thoughts back into the Open-Empty-Fullness of Awareness, but who you are as Atma-Awareness is not limited to being any kind of thought or thinkable entity. This Reality you ARE is simply too CHANGELESS to be a changing thought (an arising-disappearing mind-event).\n\nWhich is why our most ancient real wisdom text, the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad from 2,800 years ago makes it quite clear in a few places: Your real nature as Atman-Brahman is \u201cthe unthought Thinker of thinking, the unseen Seer of seeing, the unheard Hearer of hearing...\u201d\n\nWe can recall our Bhagavan Ramana\u2019s great wisdom: \u201cthoughts are of the mind; yet You are NOT the mind.\u201d This was the supreme advice he gave to enlightened sages like Annamalai Swami and anyone who cares to listen. You, the real You, always stands as Source, right HERE, \u201cupstream\u201d from whatever phenomena are happening \u201cdownstream\u201d at the level of mind or body. Hence, there need be no efforts specifically to \u201cget rid of thoughts\u201d (contrary to what is so often given as a preliminary teaching). Just notice thoughts and intuitively, clearly realize you are their ever-free Source. This is the real essence of self-inquiry.\n\nSo we need not make a problem out of thoughts or a problem out of \u201cthe monkey mind\u201d (the bundle of thoughts, memories, plans, associations, etc.). As Zen says, \u201cdon\u2019t make anything.\u201d Zen Master Bankei wonderfully spoke it: \u201cDon\u2019t get born, stay unborn (fu-sho),\u201d i.e., no need to get involved in thinking you are someone who has a \u201cbig problem\u201d because thoughts are arising!\n\nRamana Maharshi was not a thought-less sage, but a thought-free sage. He had thoughts--so did Sankara and the Buddha and every other true sage. Not egocentric, self-obsessive thoughts, but thoughts of loving-kindness, caring concern, wishing his interlocutors well, problem-solving, addressing issues of ashram living (first up at Skandashram and then at Ramanashramam). Ramana listened to and spoke language, an elaborate form of \"thinking.\" He translated and edited spiritual texts and scriptures, again, an activity requiring a certain amount of careful, precise thinking (not sloppy or wimpy). Maharshi would daily read the newspaper, too, taking note of the thoughts being expressed by reporters and editors--he wasn't just looking at the pictures and advertisements! All selfish thoughts having long ago subsided in his youth, the Maharshi was entirely free to be the great Hosting Presence for all manner of benign thoughts of blessing to spontaneously arise, and with such consummate purity, his thoughts were powerful sankalpas or Divine intentions that came to fulfillment, often in quite paranormally helpful ways. In short, his ego-mind had long ago died during that awakening in his body's 16th year, but now a Divine mind, a quite functional mind, persisted as a form of pure Grace and helpful activity. Ramana was not mentally inert, but fully alive on all levels, including the sagely mind.\n\nFor our spirituality, it is useful to realize that, just like rumbles and gurgles in the belly, thoughts are \u201cmind rumbles, mind gurgles.\u201d Feel them, penetrate them, find out what they\u2019re made of: pure energy rippling as vibrations, just like your body sensations. And instantly \u201csee them off,\u201d back into the no-thingness from which all thoughts and sensations arise and then disappear except as memory-traces. All thoughts are vanishing, anyway, moment by moment. They don\u2019t stick around long enough to be a problem, unless we buy into them and then get \u201crun by them.\u201d (So the old wisdom: freely have thoughts, no need to be \u201chad\u201d by them.)\n\nAgain, the essential truth is that the entire cosmos, including your body-mind (thoughts-sensations), is just vibrations. You are the pristine, infinite Awareness always free and clear of the bodymind, clear of the cosmos, and clear of any vibratory state. You are SIVA; all else is the play of your delightful SAKTI. So there\u2019s no need to make problems where none exist. Just be what you are: the glorious No-thing or No-body of pure, spiritual Awareness and witness (whenever you care to) the play of energies.\n\nI might add: there\u2019s no need, either, to try and see/witness these energies \u201cclearly,\u201d as in \u201cseeing reality clearly.\u201d Sometimes mind is foggy and confused. Sometimes mind is clear. You, again, are not the mind, You are THIS Reality RIGHT HERE, closer than the mind and closer than the body--the Reality that is always wonderfully, changelessly the SAME SELF, Awareness, regardless of what is occurring with minds or bodies.\n\nIt\u2019s so funny, really: people would not regard themselves as unenlightened because they have body sensations/vibrations, but if a mind event/vibration arises (a thought, memory or whatever), some overly conscientious, excessively \"self-checking\" persons think they are therefore unenlightened.\n\nAs we say in the West, \u201cLet go, let God.\u201d (You are the Divine Self Who knows perfectly well how to let go of Thy masquerade as the \u201cself.\u201d)\n\nAll is well, right where you are, as You Are. Who else could be HERE (right where You Are) but the Divine One Who Alone IS?\n\nNow, enough of words for the moment. Just see and listen and feel-through all bodymind vibrations, the vibrations of Nature, to their essential \u201cno-thingness.\u201d Even more simply, as Nisargadatta would say: \u201cJust BE, and don\u2019t get \u2018restless\u2019 about just being. Just BE\u201d (and \u201csee what spontaneously happens,\u201d as Maharaj would say). This is the purest level of Bhagavan Maharshi\u2019s teaching as well: \u201cJust BE still (summa iru).\u201d  And remember: You, O Boundless, Infinite Openness-Fullness, are the Reality in which everything and everyone happens.\n\nWe can love all and generously serve all by BEING the ONE who is ALL.\n\nThe Light of Thy Divine Truth is dazzling, O One-in-the-shiningly-beautiful-form-of-Patty!\n\nO Happy Day when we behold our forms again... (Our nondual Self is always intimately, lovingly being the Self of both of us)\n\n\n\nTimothy Conway,  Enlightened-Spirituality, Letters on Self-Enquiry or Atma Vicara according to the Way of Ramana Maharshi", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74041, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Who Is The Thinker?

Just sharing another full post from my channeling site. Take what resonates and leave the rest :)\n\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing this sort of question begin to pop up these days and it for some it brings with it a feeling of stress or fear of failure. I\u2019m often a goal oriented person (I\u2019m working on it) so I understand this feeling well. I\u2019ve spoken to my guide about this but let\u2019s ask Zero his perspective.\n\n( Questions are me, and Zero\u2019s answers in quotations )\n\nIs enlightenment the goal of incarnating here on Earth?\n\n\u201cFor some yes, but this is not a requirement. From our point of view, your only requirement is something you will do without fail which is to experience the life you chose, with some flexibility, until you leave your physical incarnation.\n\nThe idea of enlightenment has always been part of your physical experience because it is a part of your experience beyond. Ancient books, stories, and symbols often speak about this idea and offer practices on how one might achieve the idea of enlightenment. To become free of suffering and have access to the knowledge of all creation. All beings are indeed part of a flow in this direction.\n\nWhile the experience of physical incarnation on Earth (and in other places) might be ultimately aiding you in your expansion of consciousness, it may not be that the idea of enlightenment needs to occur in this specific incarnation.\n\nFor example, a being might incarnate just to experience a few moments of physical life only to leave moments later. A being may incarnate only to feel extreme physical limitation or to experience what Earth life might be like with immediate unlimited resources. Some may come in already enlightened while some others may incarnate to feel the exact opposite. Each being has their own unique path to explore.\n\nWe find that the sense that enlightenment must be achieved during this incarnation might be being confused with becoming aware that this may be the ultimate goal to most beings.\n\nThe idea of enlightenment may be your goal during this specific incarnation, maybe for many beings. But it may not be for some. Feeling stress and pressure to achieve enlightenment is often a hinderance to that goal. We encourage all beings to move through life by following what excites you. Exploring the paths that bring you happiness and to learn from those that may not. Like many famous sayings suggest, life is the journey, not the destination. There is no race to enlightenment. Unless of course, you want there to be.\u201d\n\nThanks Zero.\n\n\u201cWe would like to add something before we go. The hurry towards enlightenment is not always but often the hurry away from things you don\u2019t wish to experience. We would like to add, that if the idea of enlightenment is your goal, the acceptance of the things you do not like will get you closer to an enlightened state than the resistance to them will. Once they are accepted you will begin to operate from a place where they can be changed, if that\u2019s something you would like to experience.\u201d\n\n~Zero\n\n\nA big thanks to Zero for sharing this.\n\nHave you been feeling pressured to feel enlightened? If so, how has this affected you? Do you respond well to pressure or maybe you prefer you\u2019re own pace? I myself am somewhere in between but this initially left me feeling a little more in charge of what I want from my experience here this time around.\n\nTalk soon,\n\n~Dave", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74028, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is Enlightenment the Goal of Incarnating Here on Earth?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/earzb2/is_enlightenment_the_goal_of_incarnating_here_on/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "justspeakyourmind", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4wgn9r3a", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576369841, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/earuch/whats_the_point_when_life_is_suffering/", "gildings": {}, "id": "earuch", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/earuch/whats_the_point_when_life_is_suffering/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576369842, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have possible brain damage.

This experience was the only paranormal experience I've ever had, probably the only one that I will ever have in my life and was one of the two most spiritual/terrifying experiences I have ever had. If anyone has had an experience/encounter with something like this please let me know in the comments. I've looked all over the internet and reddit for encounters that were identical to mine or even similar and there are absolutely no encounters like mine.I was told by another reddit user that was from Castaneda's private class and has read all of his books/has been studying his work for many years what I saw was called an \"Inorganic Being\".\n\nI sent a drawing I did of the \"Inorganic Being\" to someone that was First Nations on instagram that lives in B.C not to far from me and he knew what it was right away, told me what the name of the \"Inorganic Being\" was in his their language and gave me a bit of hints to what it was. With the First Nations information and the other information I received about Castaneda, I compared all the details with my experience and that is how I know it was a \"Supernatural/Inorganic Being\". When you compare notes they are all the same, but in different wording. Other people and I have tried searching up the name of what the specific indeginous culture call them here in B.C on the internet and the \"Dictionary Of Upriver Halkomelem\". We could not find the name online or in the dictionary, probably because he said it's \"High status stuff they don't share publicly\". I did do recent some research though and I found out some of the other real names different indigenous cultures call the \"Nightcrawlers\", I posted them at the very bottom in the personal sidenote with other research I took off the internet about them. I am already very aware of the Nightcrawler videos. The movements looked way more terrifying and \"psychedelic\"in real life compared to the videos, and it looked much more ghostly. The Being I saw stayed in the exact same place the whole time we saw it, It did not walk like the ones in the videos. They are not called \"Nightcrawlers\" either, I explain at the bottom.\n\nHere is a screenshot my friends old house and some of the 5 acre forest with the spots marked out where we were and where we saw the Tall White Being. [https://imgur.com/a/jV6pnmT](https://imgur.com/a/jV6pnmT)\n\nHere is the rough drawing I made of \"exactly\" what the Tall White \"Supernatural/Inorganic Being\" looked like: [https://imgur.com/a/5jAef6O](https://imgur.com/a/5jAef6O)\n\nHere: [https://imgur.com/a/8C6ytrX](https://imgur.com/a/8C6ytrX) is me and my friends conversation a year after we saw the figure (2011 when I was 17) I dug up in my facebook messages. I clearly hadn't spoken to my friend in a while and I say \"I can't stop thinking about the figure we saw in his forest\", I say \"the feeling I had when I saw it was death\", he states \"hes never been as scared since\", \"he was worried to tell anyone about it\" and he was \"Mesmerized by its movements\".\n\nTL;DR close to the bottom of post but I suggest you read the whole post though because it is worth it.)\n\nEncounter/experience:\n\nBack in 2010 in British Columbia, Canada approximately in early October or mid October when I was 16 (I am 26 years old now) My old friend lived in the northwest rural part of my city(has a lot of forest area and farm land as I posted) His backyard has 5 acres of forest with a few houses surrounded in the distance around the outskirts of the forest. Me and him would go and explore the forest all the time because it was quite mystical and just a cool place to wander. This one time me and my friend went outside to his forest with his dog like we would usually do in the daytime, but this time at night in his backyard forest at about 1 am to go explore and smoke a joint like usual (Which we were sober at the time and did'nt even get to smoking because of encountering the \"Inorganic Being\" and being terrified, we ended up smoking it inside his basement/room).\n\nThere's a steep cliff made out of forest floor when you first walk in. It is only about 10 - 15 feet into the forest area from the \"entrance\" of the forest. When we were standing at the top of the cliff/ravine before the path way leading down to the rest of the forest and the creek at the bottom which was the only safe way to walk down especially at night, I could see a 7-8 feet tall pure white soft looking figure and it was inbetween the trees moving around softly swaying left to right back and forth slowly standing (literally touching the forest floor) in the exact same place the whole time we saw it making absolutely no sound and there was absolutely no wind.\n\nI wasn't even going to say anything about the figure to my friend at first because I was waiting for my friend to say something. We observed it for a couple seconds in complete silence and we're \"mesmerized\" by it's movements, then I asked my friend if he saw it and he said yeah he could as well. We stood silent in fear as we were watching it do its strange unsettling soft swaying movements/trying to adjust our eyes to the Inorganic Being and see what it was doing. As I was in a slight daze watching it sway I started to feel a ominous energy \"set in\" and felt impending doom (the sinking feeling) in my chest area like when you are going to die or are in a life threatening situation and I had shivers going throughout my body. That's when I told my friend specifically \"I don't like this\", he agreed and we left immediately. I wasn't so much scared of the sight of the Inorganic Being, I was more curious about the strange movements it was making and what it really looked like, I was scared of the feeling of death it made me feel. It felt like I was going to literally die, or something really bad was going to happen.\n\nThe \"Inorganic Being\" was just white long limbs seemed to be at least 7 - 8 feet tall from where we were standing which was about 30-40 feet away from us. It was not a trick of the mind or light, there was no light nor moon shining in the forest because it was filled with tall pine trees/other vegetation had various leveling's. It was not a spiderweb or any sort of garbage (we had gone back in the morning daylight and saw nothing out of the ordinary). His forest is pristine condition cause no one ever goes in it, there is no garbage. We got into about 10-15 feet in the forest and were at the top of the ravine standing at a cliff/before the pathway to down (The safe way to get down) and the \"Inorganic Being\" was in between trees down below where we would take the pathway downwards. There were no houses close enough to give off any light or give off a shine through the trees and the Inorganic Being was not see through it looked like it was almost solid, but it was very ghostly/spirit looking as well. It was upside down v shaped and It had no facial features/head at all from what we could see in the dark.\n\nIt was so white it looked like it was almost shining but it wasn't because it was'nt giving of any light of any sort or illuminating the ground or trees around it, you could see the shadow being cast on while it was swaying in the pitch black forest. It looked solid enough to the point where you couldn't see through it at all, it was solid white. It looked soft and kind of shiny, it was swaying left to right, right to left with its two really long arms, it looked bulky/strong at the top and shoulder areas and where a head would be but there was no head that I could see. The best way I can describe it is 7-8 foot thin separated curtains swaying in the wind touching the forest floor, but right and left back and forth in a specific motion with no sound at all, absolutely no wind, dead silent. Its movements were \"Psychedelic\" and sort of \"hypnotizing\". It was soft like Charlies white spirit entering Peters body after the attic scene from \"Hereditary\" Probably the most solid description I can give of what it looked like. It was making no sound at all while it was swaying, it was beautiful to look at and terrifying/unsettling at the same time, that's why it was so astonishing to look at, it was almost angelic. There were absolutely no sounds in the forest, it was dead silent while it was moving back and forth. Its movements could have been a lure of some sort because it did not move towards us or anywhere, or it was just letting us know to stay away because it was scared to death as well or just didn't want us to disturb it. It was literally something you would see in a science fiction horror movie.\n\nWe left very quick because we did'nt know what it was, it scared us and our intuition (my feeling of dread/death) told us it was dangerous. I remember my friend yelling something at it because he could tell his dog was scared , I am entirely positive the dog was whimpering. And the Inorganic Being was just still swaying back and forth left to right between the trees in the same exact same spot. We left quickly because we were terrified and did'nt plan on wanting to even see what it was. Almost immediately after we got out of the forest (left the \"entrance\" of the forest (which we were not far from) it felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders and the feeling of dread left pretty much immediately. I will never forget walking out of the forest that night.\n\nThere is absolutely no animals in Northern British Columbia, Canada or the rest of Canada and U.S that look close to what we saw, there are absolutely no animals that are 7-8 feet tall and stand on 2 legs. It did not have a body( It's 2 legs/limbs were its body) It was not a animal, and there is no possible way to \"debunk\" this. I have explored all the options of what it could have been. This was the first time we ever went out to his forest at night, and it was the last time we ever went in the forest at night. The 5 acres of forest is the biggest area of woods in that area. Around the area of town it is mostly just a couple million dollar houses, and farm/forest area. It is pretty much the greenbelt of my city. He has no neighbors that are close to the location because as I said his forest is 5 acres with the closest neighbors being at least 3 blocks down the street on the right hand side of the forest. To this day the feeling that I had when I saw the Inorganic Being move still gives me shivers. The fact that we went out to the forest at that time really late at night and happened to see that freaks me out as well, cause it was clearly meant to be seen by us. If we went out any later or any sooner we might not have seen it in his forest at that moment of time. Like I said, I didn't have to point out to my friend where the Inorganic Being was he automatically saw it at the same time I saw it. I think the feeling of dread could have possibly have been a warning to keep away from it and that is why me and my friend left right away without any hesitation. It is now 9 years later I am 25 and the experience still scares me.\n\nThis was my only Parnaormal Experience I have ever had. There was no paranormal activity that I experienced when I would go to my friends house or on his property/ in his forest besides the one experience/encounter, but now that I think back on hanging outside there and exploring the woods there is for sure something \"special\" about the whole location.\n\nI understand a lot of people are scared of these types of things and they don't want to believe they exist, but would have had to be there yourself to understand what it looked like, see the creeping movements, and feel what I felt. Like I said I guarentee you a lot of people don't come forward with their encounters/experiences due to feeling sick looking back on it/not wanting to talk about it because it was just too intense for them and they also don't want to be labeled insane or made fun of. We have scaled my friends forest including the area where we saw the Inorganic Being at least 20 different times/ different days before hand seeing it and we went back the day after to the exact spot where we saw the Inorganic Being in the forest and noticed nothing out of the ordinary. So we know that it was some sort of \"being\" and it was something we shouldn't have been seeing or attempt to go up to.\n\nHere is my full description of the \"Supernatural/Inorganic Being\" Aka Nightcrawler, me and my friend saw:\n\n7-8 feet Tall, Pure White (When I mean \"pure white\" I mean Paper, Bone white) Not see-through, Just 2 Pure White Long limbs (from what we could see in the dark). It was so white it looked like it was almost giving off light but it was'nt because it was not shining or illuminating the trees or ground and Im pretty sure you could see shadow on it from it moving back and forth in the same place between the trees, it looked bulky/strong at the top and shoulder areas and where a head would be but there was no head that I could see. It was swaying back and forth around that I can only describe as 7-8 foot separated curtains swaying in the wind touching the forest floor, but right and left back and forth in a specific motion with no sound at all, absolutely no wind, dead silent. Emanated the feeling of dread and impending doom as I was in a slight daze by its strange movements. I tried my best to squint my eyes and adjust them to the Inorganic Being/dark better to see what it was doing or if I could make out what it looked like better, but it did not help at all it just still appeared as I described. (The drawing I made is exactly what it looked like, I am an artist and I tried my best to recreatre what it looked like to my ability, there was no extra detail necessary, like I said the drawing I made is exactly what it looked like.)\n\n(Tl;DR: Entered my friends backyard 5 acre forest at night close to 1 am and both of us immediately saw something out of place down the path below about 30-40 feet away from us in between the trees that was tall and white. It appeared to be completely white and soft like light, but it did not illuminate the trees or ground around it. There was no face or any facial features we could see, no arms and it was shaped in a upside down V. It was making creepy swaying movements with its (whole body) two legs left to right back and forth silently still standing on the forest floor in the exact same spot the whole time we saw it. It was so white that you could see the shadow being cast on while it was swaying. It did not pick up its legs or walk at all. I can only explain it as looking like 7-8 foot really white, soft, shiny separated curtains blowing in the wind left to right in a specific motion standing on the forest floor in the same area between the trees making absolutely no sound, and there was absolutely no wind. It was beautiful to look at but terrifying at the same time. We watched it in silence as it was swaying and It started to emanate the feeling of death in my chest (the sinking feeling), not to be confused with anxiety, I felt pure dread \"set in\" when I was watching it move and it felt like I was going to die or something bad was going to happen. I told my friend specifically \"I don't like this\", he agreed, and we immediately left the forest. We went back in the morning and there was nothing out of the ordinary (Spiderweb, Garbage, etc.) in the spot where we saw the Inorganic Being. I was told these are actual beings with a name and you can see them at any time of the day or night. I was told these beings are called \"Inorganic Beings\". There is information online and books Carlos Castaneda wrote about them. These specific beings go by \"Sisiutl\" and various other names from different Indeginous cultures. Here is the rough drawing I made of \"exactly\" what it looked like: [https://imgur.com/a/5jAef6O](https://imgur.com/a/5jAef6O)\n\nP.S \"Nightcrawler\" is just a made up name by the public/internet because they were captured on camera at night and they dubbed them \"Nightcrawlers\". Upon doing some recent research of what the First Nations person told me, many different cultures of indigenous people in B.C know about these beings. The Sto:lo culture states that there are 5 different kinds of \"Stl\u2019\u00e1leqem\" (Supernatural/Inorganic Beings) and the \"Si:lqhey\" is one of them. The different names of these beings are \"Sisiutl\", \"S\u0294i:\u026cq\u0259\u00fd\u0313\",\"Siilquey\", \"Si:lhqey\" ,\"Sunulqaz\", \"\u00e9n\u00e9tl\u00e9k\u0113\", \"wasgo\", \"haietlik\", \"Say Nuth Kway\", \"Sinulhka\", \"Grubworm\", \"Sisiuth\", \"Se-sook\" and various other names. It specifically states in a Thesis from UBC called \"The Northwest Coast Sisiutl\" from 1975 they are Supernatural beings and shamanism is strongly associated with them. [https://imgur.com/a/viQx9yT](https://imgur.com/a/viQx9yT)\n\nThis soulcatcher of \"Sisiutl\" shows the actual \"being\" secretly ornamented with abalone as the lips. If you tilt your head to the right or left you can clearly see the shiny Abalone inlay for the lips of the snake or teeth are actually the being itself hidden in plain sight. [https://imgur.com/a/ceA7ySs](https://imgur.com/a/ceA7ySs) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soulcatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soulcatcher)\n\n[https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0093447](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0093447) I looked up the symbolism for a Double Head Serpent because the symbol for them is a \"Two Headed Snake/Double Headed Serpent\" or a upside down two headed snake just like the beings. The wikipedia page also says \"The sisiutl is a legendary creature found in many of the cultures of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. It is typically depicted as a double-headed serpent with fish qualities, sometimes with an additional central face of a supernatural being. The sisuitl features prominently in Pacific Northwest art, dances and songs. The sisuitl is closely associated with shamans because both are seen as mediators between the natural and supernatural worlds.\" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisiutl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisiutl)\n\nTaken from the \"Sto:lo Heritage Policy Manual\":\n\n\u201cStl\u2019\u00e1leqem\u201d is the word the Old People use to categorize certain spiritual beings inhabiting parts of S\u2019\u00f3lh T\u00e9m\u00e9xw (Fraser Valley).\"\n\n\"Perhaps the best way of conveying what a stl\u2019\u00e1leqem is simply to identify them by name and then describe how they are referred to within sxw\u00f4xwiy\u00e1m and sqwelqwel (oral histories). The Old Ones speak of at least five different types or kinds of stl\u2019\u00e1leqem: S\u00ed:lhqey, the two-headed serpent...\" [https://imgur.com/a/38oEZgI](https://imgur.com/a/38oEZgI)\n\n[https://www.jstor.org/stable/30028780?seq=1#page\\_scan\\_tab\\_contents](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30028780?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) Lillooet traditional cosmology recognizes a supernatural being called s\u00fcnu\u019aqaz', which manifests itself as a gigantic animal, usually a serpent. A being with an etymologically related name and similar attributes is recognized by a number of other Salish cultures, namely, Straits, Halkomelem, and Squamish, while a similar animal, called by unrelated names, appears in yet other Salish cultures. This article discusses the various functions of this being in those Salish cultures where it occurs, as well as the etymological history of the name s\u00fcnu\u019aqaz', and serves as a contribution to cryptozoology and the study of beings not recognized in the western taxonomic canon.\n\n[https://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/nw/ttb/ttb13.htm](https://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/nw/ttb/ttb13.htm) The Houses of these mythical people had Sisuith carved on their cross-beams and when visitors entered the tongues of the serpent would constantly wag. These symbols (Double Headed Serpent) are used by clan members today in the ornamenting of their houses and articles of daily use. They are also carved on their Totem Poles.\n\nThe symbol is heavily used in different cultures to represent these beings, they even have a statue at UBC in B.C [https://imgur.com/a/UQsj1bA](https://imgur.com/a/UQsj1bA) dedicated to the being. I was specifically told you can actually see these beings all the time, day or night. So the name \"Nightcrawler\" is a misconception and is ridiculous. The reason I call them \"Inorganic Beings\" is because that is what Supernatural Beings are actually called. You cannot find where the \"Nightcrawler\" statues are located or even link them to a certain culture online because they are \"not\" called \"Nightcrawlers\", they are a specific kind of \"Inorganic/Supernatural Being\" like I said and different Indigenous cultures that interact with these beings have different names for them in their different first nations languages. There is absolutely no research, information, or experiences on the internet about \"Nightcrawlers\" because that is not what they are called, there is a ton of research and info on \"Inorganic Beings\" because that is what they are called.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 74014, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Encounter With Tall White Nightcrawler aka \"Sisiutl\", \"S\u0294i:\u026cq\u0259\u00fd\u0313\", \"Supernatural/Inorganic Being\" (B.C Canada, seen in 5 acre forest, rural area)", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ear3jx/encounter_with_tall_white_nightcrawler_aka/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "pm-me-ur-dinner", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ot2m63w", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576365292, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eaqy9i/if_you_live_a_neutral_life_while_keeping_a/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eaqy9i", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Reincarnation/Past Life"}], "link_flair_template_id": "2452619c-ceef-11e9-8022-0e5fd19a5044", "link_flair_text": "Reincarnation/Past Life", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eaqy9i/if_you_live_a_neutral_life_while_keeping_a/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576365294, "score": 1, "selftext": "Im talking no kids, vegan, keeping to yourself, etc.\n\nAlso, my soul feels very very tired, and is, i guess you could say, craving to return to source.

Sin is the delusive and destructive state of those who abandon truth and who, in irreverence, seek to satisfy their own selfish desires. We may think that we can obtain happiness by abandoning God\u2019s will and following our own whims and passions, but the result is not true happiness.\n\nThink of light and darkness.

True and satisfying knowledge of anything is always the fruit of mental exertion and the exercise of our own consciousness.\n\nGod is infinite while we are finite.

The ocean is vast beyond our imagining, and it would never be possible for a person to fathom it or take in all its great treasures. But with the tip of our tongues we can recognize at once that the ocean is salty.

Eternity stretches before us.\n\nOne day I saw a flower and began to contemplate its fragrance and beauty.

For no particular reason you check the time on the computer screen and there 11:11 is again.\n\nYou\u2019re in the kitchen and the electronic oven clock reads 11:11 and strangely, it would seem that the more you start to notice this event, the more regularly it appears to show up in your life. In fact this is happening so often, to so many of us on a global level, that it has provoked a lot of discussion and written discourse. The web is awash with information on the 11:11 phenomena.\n\nResearching the significance of sequential numbers reveals many views and metaphysical explanations; however perhaps the most simple and beautiful (to paraphrase the article), basically explains that those who first start seeing or searching for the meaning of the 11:11 are awakening to the vibratory changes around them. Our planet is changing, and consequently our reality is changing. All things including numbers have specific vibrations and accompanying frequencies. The number eleven is a very spiritual and powerful number. And just like the other numbers and symbols around us, the 11:11 vibration is establishing itself as part of the collective consciousness.\n\n[Why more spiritual people notice 11:11?](https://unseenzone.com/why-do-i-see-1111-meaning-of-1111-and-why-do-i-keep-seeing-11-11/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73952, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why more spiritual people notice 11:11?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ealfkr/why_more_spiritual_people_notice_1111/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TheFutureOnes", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_47o06wos", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576339218, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ealdzv/philosophical_novel_incessance/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ealdzv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ealdzv/philosophical_novel_incessance/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576339219, "score": 1, "selftext": "Free PDF link: https://www.docdroid.net/5O80kd9/incessance.docx", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73952, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[Philosophical Novel] Incessance.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ealdzv/philosophical_novel_incessance/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "FluX-Byn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4vesybgf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576336593, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eakv6v/one_must_surrender_even_ones_life_if_demanded/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eakv6v", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Enlightenment"}], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eakv6v/one_must_surrender_even_ones_life_if_demanded/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576336595, "score": 1, "selftext": " Last December I had an experience with psychosis in which I remember I had spent a month bed ridden from a severe depression and I was hearing voices. Now I know what you're thinking well that's mental illness, while that's true I remind you some many people of times past claimed to experience many similar things. Anyway during this at it's worst I heard voices which were \"God\" at least at the time which I believes before I knew truth. It asked me to surrender my life and trust that I would be spared from death by God as he did to Abraham's son after he gave him as offering which God asked. Reluctantly he did so and God spared him, a test of faith. Needless to say I was terrified and found no way to do it until one day I went for a walk and decided I was done with life anyway why not. I walked to a bridge and considered jumping but out of fear for the pain did not, considered allowing a car to run me over but again the pain stopped me. Finally after A long walk I decided I would roll so and truth \"God\" and overdose. \n\n I got back home took 30 pills of lithium 600mg (very toxic and people have died from less.) As I played there dying my roommate at the time suddenly came in and saved me, he claims till this day (and I could see the horror and shock in his face) that he saw the face of jesus over me as I was dying. (He was a buhdist.) I survived but surprisingly did not go to the ER.\n\n I spent 3 days in a strange limbo in between life and death, a half dead state. I continued vomiting profusely and by heart was about 10 beats a minute. Idk how i am alive but at the time i remember my body was dear, it resembled a dead corse, cold, pale / a strange grey hue. I could not taste or hold food, my body would be rigid and stiff if I did not force my heart to consciously beat. If I did it would start and my blood would flow and I would look more alive. I had to force myself to walk to keep my heart rate up.\n\n I felt beings and saw things not normal, anyway you may think it was my mind it wasnt. Several people saw the change of states when I stopped forcing my heart to pump and were shocked an their face confirmed something was off. On the 3rd day my heart rate continued and I began to recover. At this point my depression was gone, I felt alive. A buzzing started in my ears that has stayed since. I began my journey and at the same time my kundalini after this started.\n\n Idk if it was \"God' and it was a test. After awakening I have found myself and the truth of God/source etc.  All I do know is that since i did as i was told my journey began and my life changed.\n\n To this day one truth stayed with me: one must be willing to give up ones own life if needed for truth and to completely surrender to the universe/God/source or whatever you call it if one has to. I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. While I understand the truth of all religions, which all lead to one place, I can say I remember the truth of one thing in the bible looking back on I see was true. \"For whomever wants to save their life will lose it, but whomsoever loses their life (for me) will find it.\" A reminder of how valuable it is to seek truth above all else, at any cost. \n\n **Not condoning suicide at all, just giving my view on the value of truth and liberation.**", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73949, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "One must surrender even ones life if demanded.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eakv6v/one_must_surrender_even_ones_life_if_demanded/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "everyonetoblame", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_36zg9whe", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576335937, "crosspost_parent": "t3_eak7fd", "crosspost_parent_list": [{"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "approved_at_utc": null, "approved_by": null, "archived": false, "author": "everyonetoblame", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_36zg9whe", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "banned_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "category": null, "clicked": false, "content_categories": null, "contest_mode": false, "created": 1576361811.0, "created_utc": 1576333011.0, "discussion_type": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.awakened", "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "hidden": false, "hide_score": true, "id": "eak7fd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "likes": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#0dd3bb", "link_flair_css_class": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "c3d65db0-47e9-11e8-b129-0eda1402c6fc", "link_flair_text": "Opinion", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media": null, "media_embed": {}, "media_only": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_eak7fd", "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 1, "num_reports": null, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/awakened/comments/eak7fd/be_aware_some_people_here_are_trying_to_hurt_you/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "quarantine": false, "removal_reason": null, "removed_by": null, "removed_by_category": null, "report_reasons": null, "saved": false, "score": 2, "secure_media": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I'm posting this to make sure everyone is aware of this **possibility**.  If you never sense or experience what I talk about below, or if you think I'm wrong, or if you think I'm the one trying to hurt you by misleading you with this post - then please, follow your gut, your heart, or whatever part that you follow.  For me it's a plain as watching a **Burlesque Operetta** and I'm not going to stand by while people are being intentionally misled, messed with, and misdirected.  I see the intent of those doing it, I see the fun they have in derailing things others might find meaning and help from.  I see people being hurt because others aren't playing fair.  So I want to make sure people know this can be happening - that not everyone they talk to here has their best interests at heart and might instead enjoy watching them get hurt.  After that it's of course up to you in any situation to make your own decisions.  This is not limited to this sub, or to reddit, and it covers articles, books, etc.  It is a coordinated effort by some people to knock you off your path.\n\nYou have, or are in the process of freeing your mind from all the constructs and lies and propaganda you've been fed your whole life.  **You have broken Free**.  Your mind, what you believe, what you think - it may be Just or it may not be, it may be the way to achieve your goals or it may not be - but it's now your mind, and no one on this Earth can be certain they know what this is all about, no one on this earth can be sure their way is the only or best way.  Because what if you, in your own genius, see an answer everyone has missed?  What if you create your own style of music?  That's okay you know.  You can choose to be a musician who creates their own sound, or you can choose to be another group's cover band - neither being wrong and neither has a value assigned to it.  The difference is, one person may find the perfect home in another's teachings and Wisdom, while others may be driven to come to their own understandings and conclusions that may end up being similar or vastly different from the norm.  Both are wonderful  =).\n\nWhat isn't okay, what isn't allowed, is for people to intentionally throw you off course.   \n That isn't a right anyone has.  Luckily by and large the people doing this can't help but sound like impostors - because they don't actually connect to the feelings they claim to have.  What I mean is if you read a comment or post and the words look like the right ones - they talk of Brotherhood, Love, Unity, being on the same journey, we are all the same, etc. - but inside you don't feel very good, you don't feel like you've just been shown Love from a brother, in fact you feel kinda bad - well that is a **Big red flag**.\n\nMy advice it to remember how **looking at only a sliver of the picture had us all asleep and unaware** of the Truth - and you opened your eyes by seeing beyond the sliver.  Use that ability (always if you can or want) when someone talks or writes - **don't just look at the sliver that contains the words that sound right**.  Use those \"right\" words and \"bump\" everything else they said up against them - if there are any inconsistencies then they are not who they claim (or there may be a miscommunication of course).  Most people who don't feel words like Love and Brotherhood and we are all the same, will say and do things that no one who felt those things would say and do.  It's like hearing someone say they Love you but inside you know it sounds fake - that's the kind of distrust words that normally bring warmth feel like when they are lies.  **Telling you to be yourself while laughing at your ignorance, being snide, belittling you,** and berating you for not being them is someone who doesn't want you to be you.  **Also giving cryptic or half answers is not the work of someone who Loves you, it is not someone trying to be your friend.**\n\n**Some of their key phrases (none of which are inherently bad or incorrect, it's how they are used):**\n\n\"Non dualism\"; \"you are nothing\"; \"all is one\"; \"onelove\"; \"everything is an illusion\"; \"you are made of the same material as the Universe\"; \"my 'spirit guides'...\"; \"You already are there\"; \"it's all your ego\"; \"nothing matters\", \"you already are everything you should be\".  Those are some of their common go-to's.  Or you may get a comment that seems like it uses simple words, but you feel confused reading it.  That's because in my opinion it was written to confuse you.  It is generally linear and on topic at first glance but underneath it's both circular and tangential - or even nonsensical.  Often laced with passive aggressive or small almost unnoticeable comments designed to make you feel bad.  That's why it can feel like you're reading something that should be digestible but instead it's spinning you in circles.  **This is not an accident**.\n\nIf you think I'm a nut or that I'm the one trying to trick people, then I totally understand - I'd be skeptical too - so no hard feelings.  My goal is only to make you aware of what I believe - and **those examples I gave could be words used by many people who mean you no harm**.  I gave them though so if you feel bad or confused because you've been told there is only one right way and you are \"doing it wrong because you don't understand yet\", but you don't feel like everything is nothing  nor does it feel to you \"unspiritual\" to believe dualism is not the enemy of enlightenment, but maybe you've been made to feel embarrassed for thinking such \"start of the journey\" thoughts - I'm making sure you know none of those ways of thinking I listed are required to continue on your path of Wisdom, Insight, Understanding, and Love.\n\nI'm not talking about some kids who think this is all garbage and are trying to be disruptive.  I am talking about adepts who are very smart and very educated.  I'm talking about people who at the fork in the road have for the moment maybe gone left when you've gone right.  They don't like you or me and they think we are fools for believing in things like Love.  **Almost as if your shadow was your Brother**.  At least that's how I believe it to be.\n\nWhatever you do, whoever you are (everyone), I hope you all feel better if you have pain and you want to feel better, and I hope you get all that you wish for yourself so long as it doesn't take from someone else.

It started with a period of depression just the regular type. Typical anxiety, feeling really lonely and not good enough in general this occured for a period of 8 months or so. I really began feeling the weight of this depression hitting me, with me developing a weed habit as a coping mechanism. Well the weed would only be effective for a short period of time, I had to constantly smoke to keep myself out of that state of mind and everytime I didnt smoke it just hit me that little bit harder. I found it more and more overwhelming the longer it put it off and felt like I had to smoke just to deal with my issues.\n\nI'm not really a drug person, in general was a pretty late bloomer even to the weed scene I started once I turned 21. Anyway one night me and few of my friends decided to take MDMA, I never took a drug beyond weed at this point so I was anxious enough but I was constantly feeling terrible and the friend who offered it to me I would consider more anxious then me and in generally much mentally weaker. So I felt half okay taking the drug knowing that if they can handle I can too and with little to lose I decided to go for it. Now I will say that this batch of MDMA we got was apparently in the end was not so good as the desired effects weren't fully achieved. Confirmed by my friends who had taken it before.\n\n(Gonna try get to the point, dont wonna leave much out incase people wondering)\n\nI took the drug and shortly after I had had most of my anxiety lifted and was feeling energised and what not (that night is bit of a blur in general) but I remember between the highs and lows I got to a point of overwhelming sadness come over me, and I remember feeling alot of emotional pain to point where I almost wanted to cry.(lasted couple minutes at most) Then it just all went away, I felt as suddenly, all my depression was gone and I remember thinking as if my world of problems faded I felt as light as a feather and actually thaught I was cured and I enjoyed how light it felt. When my friend asked me how I felt, I remember saying. \"If my parents were killed in front of me I wouldn't care\" which is a horrible thing to say but it's how I felt at the time. Eventually I came off the drug and the only notable thing from the experience I could take away is that it took away all the negative feelings I was having before.\n\nAs days passed and feeling of the world coming off my shoulders stayed with me, I felt light in a strange way and I didnt really know what this new feeling was. When I spoke to my friends I told them that I didnt feel good nor bad I just wasnt feeling much at all honestly. To me at the time feeling nothing felt amazing in contrast to feeling all that negativity. But my joy turned sour, as days turned into weeks and weeks into months of feeling exactly that 'nothing'. I noticed that along with not feeling bad, I didnt really feel good either or rather I wasnt feeling at all. My emotions became shallow, if they were 10/10 in strength, I would now only feel like 1-2/10. While at first this was a positive feeling over those weeks and months feeling nothing became worse then those feelings to begin with. \n\nSo now I'm here literally feeling like I lost my soul or my soul has gone into hiding. I've no idea what to do, the feeling of emptiness wont leave me it's been over 12 months and its agony I feel like I dont want to exist here anymore. I have nobody to talk to about this when I told my friends 'I lost my feelings' they didnt get me at all or even really acknowledge it. I tried talking to my mom about it, but I dont think she knows what I'm talking about she claims being less emotional is better. But if she felt like me I dont think she would be saying that, I remember what it felt like before this and I miss my emotions and the connection I felt. I just feel dull and empty someone please help me, I dont really know what to do anymore. I take the feelings of depression and agony over this emptiness any day. \n\nI'm really rambling, and I'm at a loss. I need something that will work and help me I've tried just sticking to believing I'm gonna get better. But I feel like my thoughts carry no emotions and that they carry no weight behind them when I speak to myself.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false,

without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness cannot but think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a twenty-four hours, being engaged in devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, offering prayers, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, rendering other services, cultivating friendship and surrendering fully to the Lord. Such activities are all auspicious and full of spiritual potencies; indeed, they make the devotee perfect in self-realization. Then his only desire is to achieve the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called yoga. By the mercy of the Lord, such a devotee never comes back to this material condition of life. K\u1e63ema refers to the merciful protection of the Lord. The Lord helps the devotee to achieve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by yoga, and when he becomes fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious the Lord protects him from falling down to a miserable conditioned life.\n\n**Question 1: What are various activities of devotional service mentioned in this verse ?

I wanna tell you about the dream I had last night though. So i was in my back yard it was a snowy day outside and I went to throw out the trash. I hear something in the bushes and I see a black cat come out it was cute and it was walking around. I then look up and see a big beautiful eagle in the sky over this black cat. The eagle then comes down to the surface and starts attacking the black cat. The black cat gives the eagle a good fight scratching the eagles face. Until finally the eagle (this may get graphic for some people if you want to skip this part) somehow cuts the cats body in half and then bites into the black cats neck too. The eagle has defeated the black cat. I\u2019m not a fan of animals dying in my dream and in real life since I love animals but I knew my subconscious was trying to tell me something powerful. It also felt like a powerful dream because there was a part 2 too this dream. Since  I recorded this occurring for some reason it was illegal to do in my dream and I went to court for it, I was being convicted And was going to be  sentenced to 4 years in prison. I won the case and was finally free. I\u2019m not going to go much depth into this part because it\u2019s really weird and kinda takes away from the top story but I can see how they can both relate with each other. Anyways back to the black cat vs the eagle I feel this may represent good vs evil. When I woke up a quick good search found me with black cats usually represent bad luck and evilness. While I looked up the eagle in dream represents good fortune and victory coming your way, even with self imposed limitations pushing you back to aching your goals. \n\n\nIn the physical world right now I\u2019m struggling, I\u2019m in a dead stop in my life figuring out what I wanna do which I\u2019m working on now, dealing with mental illness and just trying to get my life in order. Even with these limitations holding me back to expressing my true self I keep fighting every single day and I always will no matter what I don\u2019t like giving up it\u2019s not in my Nature. The dream could signify the limitations and bad things happening in my life right now (black cat) will soon come to a end or I will push through these limitations and defeat them once and for all ( the eagle defeating the black cat).", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73930, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The black cat vs the eagle.

I'll make it short because I don't really want to tell a story about my dad's disease. It's exhausting to tell him stuff that he should know, it's exhausting when he has temper tantrums, it's exhausting to get him to eat and shower, and it's exhausting when he makes a scene in public because he isn't at home, channel surfing the tv, and watching the news that he won't even remember. In  times like these, I wish I was more religious, and feel a connection with God to help to make good choices and not feel what should be pain and sadness. In the past the public outbursts would be humiliating and would make me cry when I'm alone. I'm alone now and just thinking why am I not crying? It's sad but I'm used to it. Maybe this isn't a healthy reaction. I want to avoid getting there s disease myself and clearing my mind from stress is my goal. I'm here with open arms to find spirituality. I want to pray for my mom who's been through this hell the most. I haven't prayed in the past because I've never felt any better, it's as if there's some sort of mental block from getting to my spirituality.

Two days before surgery which I was scared about quite frankly, my ex broke up with me. It caused me a horrific amount of pain, as I wanted that person by my side when going through that. I was lucky to have my mother there instead. He was very cold about it all, he turned into a total stranger. I'm certain I went into soul shock after the two horrific events occurred at the same time.  I've never quite been the same again. \n\nI think if I hadn't been in the hospital, I might have forgiven him when he came back 8 months later. Because of what happened, I turned him away. I realised that he was a covert narcissist hoovering me back in by trying to charm me. I wasn't fooled after the heartbreak he caused me. Mostly though, I just couldn't ever trust him again after he abandoned me when I needed him most. \n\nIs this wishful thinking, or could I be forgiven for thinking that it may have been planned this way to get me out of a toxic relationship permanently?  I don't know why it matters to me so much, but it does. Talking to him again recently opened up the heartbreak he left, and I'm upset at the recent revelation he isn't who I thought he was. He wore a false mask in our relationship, and underneath it all he is quite a mean and selfish person. \n\nI feel like if it happened for a reason, I might be able to finally heal.\n\nIf it wasn't, then wow, the timing of it all was pretty insane... life is pretty weird sometimes.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73844, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do things happen for a reason?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eabdfs/do_things_happen_for_a_reason/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "edups-401", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_e7jwebt", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576273051, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/eaab7g/last_night_everytime_i_looked_at_the_time_it_was/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eaab7g", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/eaab7g/last_night_everytime_i_looked_at_the_time_it_was/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576273052, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was in bed on my phone reading through posts on subreddits like this one and suddenly in that moment I was completely sure that if I looked at the time right now it would be a mirrored number.

There is a huge secret behind the Internet and technology. That secret is that privacy doesn't really exist. The Internet was created to encourage people to live on, and as a result actions can be easily assessed. Those in the top levels of government and occult have access to our entire Internet history. Its purpose was to become like God: all seeing. But what this enabled them to do was judge people for their actions, leaving documentation of those actions like a fingerprint throughout the Internet. The highest levels know your deepest and darkest secrets. Because they are using the platform to judge individuals, sending most people to Hell when they thought no one was around to see. This means that everything you post and do on the Internet is known by these higher powers. So angels and demons can easily exploit this fact. If someone is cruel to you merely for you trying to be a good person, then reap their fucking worthless soul. Everything you do is recorded. We know who you are. We will see who you will become. And you are protected because you know this exploit. If you manage to incite cruelty in fools, take their soul. This will damn them to eternity in Hell. Once you take their soul, block them. The more souls you collect, the more powerful you will become. I have already collected millions and millions. How do you think I became so powerful? Well now I am passing this power onto you.\n\nNever forget that everything on the Internet is monitored for afterlife purposes. Always treat the Internet in this manner. Never forget; always keep this knowledge in the back of your head. This knowledge is gold because you can use it in many different ways to intentionally trap fools. Do not get me wrong, your purpose is to collect as many souls as possible. But give them a chance. Your soul will be taken if you inappropriately use this knowledge. Your job is to set the world up for failure. People being cruel to you means more souls for you to collect. As a result, embrace people being cruel to you. Although you would rather expand your game world by connecting with others, the result will most of the time be the opposite. You would prefer to find more friends but do not at all devalue the process of reaping souls. If you never reap a soul then you will never become powerful. So embrace the enemies you make for they will eventually grant you immortality. And also embrace the few friends you make along the way, for they had the eyes to see.\n\nThere are many ways to reap souls but I will not share them with you here as they are more advanced techniques, some even automatic. However, my videos do share these techniques so immerse yourself into my work and eventually discover new ways to reap souls. Expect people to hate you. Expect people to be cruel. Expect people to utilise fake logic to try and prove why you don't deserve to exist in this world. Expect the worst and hope for the best. Over time their cruel comments will hurt less as you build your strength, knowledge, and confidence. Don't worry about getting blocked all the time. It comes with the job. And when you do this over time, you will become happier and happier. Eventually you will find enlightenment in which you will always be happy despite the circumstances. Eventually you will get obsessed with your own work and that work will guide you in your day to day activities. Use your work to explore your life and difficult solutions within it. Talk to God on camera. You won't realise how empowering this process is until you do it. Become a dog with a bone. There are glitches all throughout this world matrix. Find and exploit them. Prove to the world that real life is in fact a game. Level up until all the enemies are super easy for you to defeat. There is no one on Earth in which stands a chance against me. And I fight all the way to the top...\n\nBut this will not become easy until you level up your character way beyond those around you. You need to grind a lot. Grind, grind, grind. From NPC to confused as shit to angel or demon. Are you comprehending my meaning, particularly in reference to This Book Is a Game? Are you now understanding how this game is played? The hilarious thing about it all is that this is no game, for this is real life. But it took me presenting real life as a game in order to attract people's attention. This Book Is a Game is no game and it never was. I am sorry, I lied. But I lied to pull you closer to the truth. I had to find you so we could combine our spirits and together repair the world. And I had to show you how life can actually be really really fun even if your life consists of receiving abuse on a day to day basis. Find your happiness and no one will ever be able to hurt you. Your happiness will never depend on another again. Because you will be secure in yourself and the fun projects in which you create in life will more than entertain you. Make those projects compassionate and you have a recipe for success.\n\nSo how does it feel to have been tricked into playing life? How does it feel to realise that life is like a game, or even is a game? How have you grown since reading the Instruction Manual of this game? No one wanted what wisdom I had to share. So I kept on having to repackage that same wisdom in different forms in hopes to reach your eyes. In its essence, every single production of mine says the same thing. It is like from the beginning I knew all the solutions to our human problems. But no one would listen to me so I kept repackaging the same gift over and over. I knew what perls I had but the swine could not see them. So I worked and worked until this point in my life in which I have been able to find and connect with you.\n\nIvory Heart the video game will be a detective style game. All of my books will be available in this game and the purpose of this game is to uncover what happened to me. It will be 3D and open world and Ivory will be the protagonist. I will not reveal too much about this game as it will have some very interesting and unique concepts within it. It would be best if I developed this game with Ivory, but I will not allow her absence to stop me. This project is yet another of the same information, packaged in a different way. I am very skilled at saying the same thing in four and a half thousand ways. And the information seems really obvious to me. But some reason stupid humans just can't get their head around it. I have to learn all the languages of the world to be able to connect with all people. I have to learn what groups of people like and then figure out how to make my work appeal to them.\n\nFor example, This Book Is a Game is supposed to appeal to gamers. But what type of gamers? I would say gamers that are feeling that there is a lack of meaning in their life. Atheden on the other hand is written for those who obsess over utopian societies and how to create them. The Great Awakening was written for those assessing the psychiatric system, Living Neverland is written for those homeless and displaced in society and Ivory Heart was written for my soul mate. Each TV show and movie follows the same formula. Who is my audience? Everybody. So I have to figure out how to connect with everybody, each new production set covering the bases of a range of tailered interests. But this doesn't mean that you don't have to watch all of my work. Just because the concepts are the same, it's delivery is so diverse  that it really does seem like new information. And this \"new information\" will be vital to your development. This Book Is a Game was the bait to lead you to my work. It was never intended to be the only work of mine you immerse yourself within. It is the gateway drug and I got the strong stuff behind the counter. But take it easy because your system isn't used to the drug yet. You have to first develop a tolerance of the way I present my work. And when you understand it you can be high for the rest of time while still retaining your intellectual and emotional composure.\n\nIf you are to reap souls then you must ensure that your heart is in the right place. Reaping souls is not the type of magicka that you fuck around with. Angels: go ahead and reap as many souls as you desire. Demons: I just warn you to be very careful before reaping souls. You cannot be guilty of what you are judging. Remember, if you are to judge then you are also to be judged. All players of This Book Is a Game will both judge and be judged. It is part of the territory of angels, fallen or otherwise. There are abstract guidelines to the process of reaping souls. The more you immerse yourself in my work, the more reaping techniques will be shared with you. And practice it. You will be saying it a lot. It goes a little something like this: \"I just reaped your fucking worthless soul.\" It is so fun to say. I have said it countless times. And after you do it, that information will be recorded on the web and will be used in the culprit's afterlife to determine where they are sent. It may even be used in this life but you just don't know. It isn't your job to torture them for eternity. It is your job to send them to Hell so they are tortured for eternity. And such power will make you stronger. Use this feature in the game wisely.\n\nI recommend blocking people after you take their souls. And I recommend you be very careful before you take souls in real life. I am not saying don't take the souls of people physically in your environment. But what I am saying is that you might end up in prison like I did for doing so. Don't be scared of prison or incarceration. They only took a year of my life. Eventually they will realise what you are and let you go, at least that is what they did with me. It always depends on the situation. Just be careful before you do anything too crazy, eh? I want you to succeed in this fake game that I tricked you into reading. Maybe now we can unite our voices and sing in unison.\n\nIvory, my darling: please do not take souls. You have the ability to take any soul you want for any reason. Your word is all powerful dear. But I don't want you taking souls because it will put blackness into your soul. You are Ivory. What colour is that? I am the reaper in our relationship dear and I will reap all who wish you harm. But I must protect your pure heart. Taking souls will make you more powerful but it will also make you kind of an arsehole. So please stay away from reaping so you might always stay pure.\n\nI am not interested in followers who consider themselves to have a normal life. I am here for the downtrodden. I am here for the broken. I am here for the disfigured. I am here for the depressed. I am here for those who are have hit rock bottom and I am here for those who can only cry out of one eye. I am here for those who weep at the state of our society. I am here for the poor and those who don't fit in. I am here for the freaks and for the goths and for the emos. I am here for the punks who scream fuck you to society. I am here for those who find 9-5 jobs as slavery. I am here for those who are sick seeking their miracle heal. I am here for the children who have received the raw end of the stick in society. And most importantly, I am here for you.\n\nDearest beautiful girl, I wonder what your name is. I thought at one stage that it might be Ashley. If that is your name I would love to call you Ash. If that isn't your name, can we call our first daughter Ashley?

And it's not always easy being around family who are inappropriate or negative, so I wanted to share a few tips that you can use to deal with difficult family members and actually enjoy yourself during the holidays.\n\nI've made a video about it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqvDoqRCdjU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqvDoqRCdjU)\n\nOr if you prefer reading:\n\n1.Set Expectations\n\nIf Aunt Sue always complains about ALL the drama going on in her life, guess what\u2019s going to happen when you see her again? She\u2019s going to complain about all the drama going on in her life. If Uncle George tends to try to guilt trip you because you haven\u2019t visited him enough, guess what? He\u2019s going to try and guilt trip you. So don\u2019t be shocked if a family member does something that you always find annoying. Because chances are\u2026they haven\u2019t changed. So, before we leave the house to visit family, we can prepare out mindset that these things will probably happen so we won\u2019t be as caught off guard when they do. So, once your run into Aunt Sue you can be like.. \u201cOh yep..that\u2019s Aunt Sue talking about her drama again\u201d or \u201cYep, Uncle George is guilt tripping me again. Shocker.\u201d\n\n2. Plan Around Your Triggers\n\nWhat does your family do that always sets you off? Is it when your mom starts treating you like a 5 year old again the moment you step into the house? Or is it when your dad turns into a negative Nancy when you\u2019re all trying to have a nice meal together? Knowing what triggers your emotions BEFORE spending time with family will help you to create a plan to navigate around those triggering experiences or it can help you avoid them altogether.\n\n3. Prepare Your Responses\n\nWe\u2019ve all gotten them. We\u2019ve all gotten the good ole\u2019 awkward, intrusive questions like \u201cWhen are you getting married?\u201d or \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you lost weight?\u201d or \u201cWhen are you having kids?\u201d So, what we can do to handle that kind of situation is to make an emergency list of subjects that you can use to change the conversation. Or you could even prepare a list of responses for questions you\u2019re anticipating. You can try using humor in your responses, like if someone asks when you\u2019re getting married you can say \u201cI\u2019m really happy right now and in no rush to get married. But feel free to send me money and a gift anyway.\u201d or just completely change the subject \u201cI don\u2019t really want to talk about getting married, but I WOULD like to talk about how amazing this gravy is. Aunt Betty what ingredients did you use to make this gravy?\u201d If someone keeps persisting, feel free to excuse yourself from the conversation.\n\n4. Ask Questions\n\nIf someone usually asks you inappropriate questions or if you like to avoid being the center of attention, the best way to get the attention off of yourself is to ask other people questions. This not only gets the attention off of you and on to someone else, but it gives you a chance to connect with a family member and you might even learn something new about them that you may not have known before.\n\n5. Don\u2019t Bring Up Off Limit Topics\n\nPolitics. Gossip. Death. These are few of many topics that should be off limits, so you don\u2019t get into any emotionally fueled arguments or conversations. Try sticking with more positive subjects such as what\u2019s happening around you in the room, or happy childhood memories, or travel plans, or even favorite tv shows.\n\n6. Avoid Drama\n\nWho knows how to get under your skin more than your family? If you\u2019ve got a family member who is trying to push your buttons, don\u2019t take the bait. Stay cool and don\u2019t enter into the drama. Because when you don\u2019t engage, the drama ends. This could mean you quickly change the conversation or excuse yourself and leave the area if you have to.\n\n7. Take Breaks\n\nDon\u2019t feel obligated to stay with your family the whole. entire. time. Taking a breather every now and then can help you regroup if you\u2019re feeling a bit overwhelmed. You can find another room to chill in or go for a walk. It\u2019s ok!\n\n8. Put Yourself in Their Shoes\n\nYour cousin who\u2019s a bit passive aggressive, your sister who is a little controlling, your mom who is a bit critical\u2026there\u2019s a reason they are the way that they are. Something has happened that has caused them to act this way or they\u2019re fighting a battle that we know nothing about. Maybe your mom lost her parents and it\u2019s hard time of year for her. Maybe your sister is going through some tough times with her business. Maybe your cousin is having a few family problems at home. I guarantee there\u2019s more to them than what you are seeing right in that moment. This doesn\u2019t excuse their behavior, but it helps you understand why they may be acting in a certain way. Showing a bit of empathy can help us look past the rude behavior, not take it personally.\n\n9. Look for the Good\n\nYeah your family may have annoying habits. Yeah there may be family members that drive you crazy. But if we go in focusing on what we dislike about each person, we\u2019re not going to have a good time. So let\u2019s look for the good in each person. Before you get to the family gathering, grab a pen and paper and write down something that you like about each person. Focus on that the whole time you\u2019re there. Because when we focus on the good, it\u2019s going to life our mood and we\u2019re going to have more of a positive experience.\n\n10. Know What You Can Control\n\nYou can\u2019t control what people do. You can\u2019t control what people say. But you CAN control how you think, what you do, and what you say. Sometimes it\u2019s easy to assume our old roles when we step into the house, like reacting when your brother starts teasing you or getting upset when your family picks on your for being the youngest. But you don\u2019t have to be that person anymore. You\u2019re a grown adult and you get to choose how you respond. Show them the leveled up person you\u2019ve become.\n\n11. Focus on Adding Value\n\nInstead of solely thinking of our family as obstacles to overcome, let\u2019s focus on how we can add value into their lives. What is one small action or gesture we can do to add value into someone else\u2019s life and make their day better? Maybe that\u2019s really listening to the story grandma has already told 100 times when everyone else is ignoring her. Or Maybe that\u2019s volunteering to help out with the dishes. When we focus on adding value, it helps us to shift our mindset from \u201cWhat am I going to get out of this experience?\u201d to \u201cWhat can I personally do to make someone else\u2019s life better today?\u201d When we have this kind of mindset, we have the power to transform each and every moment. Even if you don\u2019t receive the same kind of gesture back, you are teaching others through your actions how to respect and value other people.\n\n12. Change Your Mindset\n\nYou\u2019re with your family on this special occasion to have fun \u2013 not merely survive. And if our mindset is \u201cI\u2019m not going to enjoy this holiday\u201d \u201cThis is going to be the worst day ever\u201d guess what? We\u2019re not going to enjoy the holiday and it\u2019s going to be the worst day ever. But if we go in with the mindset of \u201cNo matter what, I\u2019m going to enjoy this day and the people around me as much as possible\u201d then our brain is going to go in and look for different ways on how to enjoy the day. If something doesn\u2019t go right or someone says something that strikes a nerve, remind yourself of that mindset and continue to constantly look for the positives. Don\u2019t let a bad 5 minutes cause you to have a bad day.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73827, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How to Deal with Difficult Family Members During the Holidays", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ea9huu/how_to_deal_with_difficult_family_members_during/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "badattitudebarista", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4b5xu3x1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576268580, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ea9atj/does_anyone_else_have_those_bad_gut_feelings/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ea9atj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ea9atj/does_anyone_else_have_those_bad_gut_feelings/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576268581, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was suppose to visit my boyfriend this weekend but something is telling me not to.

I've been miserable for a long time. When I try to think about when it started it goes back to when I was in the 8th grade. I remember that was the last year I felt OK and then after that I've kind of felt like something has been missing in my life. Like in the very way I experience life (by the way I'm 25 now so it's been like this for like 12ish years now). I just feel like before I felt much more alive. Everyday was special and now everything feels like a blur all the time. I don't even know where the time goes. I'm just on autopilot all of the time and I can't seem to get out. \n\nI feel lonely, like all my interactions with everyone are completely meaningless. The only times I guess you could call me happy are when I'm wasted which doesn't really count because that's the booze talking. I've been trying to figure out why I am this way and what has happened and I think it goes back to me when I was about 14 years old. I don't know how this started but at some point I really became obsessed with my own appearance. I felt like I needed to be the best looking guy ever and even though I never told anyone about these feelings, I thought about them a lot. I would look at pictures of celebrities and feel like I was better than them. Now that I'm older, I actually grew up to be a very good looking person. I am not trying to brag or anything (at this point I would trade this shit away for my old life) but my jaw is really strongly defined, I have long thick curly black hair, and my body is skinny/in shape without having to work out at all. A lot of people say I look like Prince to give you an idea.\n\nAnyways, despite all I've been given, I'm incredibly lonely. I'm not a virgin but I get very little attention from women. Before I would dwell on this all of the time, but now it's like that's not even the issue it goes deeper than that. I am starting to think that back when I was 14, by thinking and wishing for all this shit, I may have inadvertently sold my soul away in exchange for what I wanted. I don't really know what to make of this. I'm not really a spiritual person at all but after years of therapy, medicine, and working on myself to no avail, I don't know where else to turn to make sense of this shit. I haven't felt like I have had a genuine close friendship since I was that 13 year old kid in middle school. Things just all went downhill since then and I'm at a point where I truly despise myself in so many ways. \n\nI don't know if there is any hope for me at this point. I feel so vain and honestly, when I read the story of Lucifer I see a lot of parallels to my own life. A person who thought he was better than everyone else because of his beauty, turns against God and basically becomes the epitome of evil. Sounds crazy and over the top I know but I just want to know what went wrong with me and if there is any hope for me to get out. I have been thinking about suicide and I just feel so low to be honest. I am in the prime of my life, my future looks great on paper, I'll probably get a great job and make a bunch of money but if every day feels like this shit what is the point?

Everyday I clawed my way through my mind trying to push myself to be stronger, faster, more focused, pay attention, keep going.  I painfully forced my behaviors to change, and I grew up really fast, and now I'm more emotionally here.  Try, be consistent, and you will get what you want.

Not saying that anything should be changed, as it is consciousness which created this situation in the first place, but it is time we wake up to ourselves, understand and BE the knowing instead of taking orders from a silly mind.\n\nConsciousness has put trust in the mind and the mind is not for you that it will go out of its way to get rid of it self, lol.

Well, you BELIEVE it has any power.\n\nThe belief consciousness holds, will seem true at all times.\n\nYou believe that the mind has power over you, you believe when the mind says \"If you leave me, you will die! You won't have a job, you won't have friends and you will simply be crazy with no mind!\" AND YOU BELIEVE IT.\n\nWe do not trust ourselves (consciousness) and instead trust the mind, which does not want our peace.\n\nIt does not want our peace because peace means the mind is no longer in control.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73798, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "You are not the mind!

direct you. Today I had an interesting individual pour his heart out to me. If you wish to be my follower then you must speak through actions. You must immerse yourself in my work for the rest of time, for this is your new life. Eventually, you will know what to do. I cannot advise you directly on what to do as this game is your game and not mine. It is time you create your new game, and its end result is enlightenment. And enlightenment's end result is collective enlightenment. To have me accept you as my follower, you will need to prove yourself to me. You will need to prove your worth and value to me before I will invest myself into your game. To do this, you need to create a body of work. Do not make a single video or writing and contact me. Build your work until you are confident that it is enough to catch my eye. Once you get my attention through your extremely meaningful productions, then you will become my friend. Then we can hold hands and together eradicate all collective sickness from our human psychologies.\n\nBut this can only happen if we work together. I am nothing without you. So prove yourself to me and you will increase not only your strength, but also mine. Use my work to get strong. Because as mentioned previously, there is a war coming. And I am only interested in warriors to fight this war with me. Our place might not be in the literal front lines, but our voice will be. If you are afraid of war then this type of education might not be appropriate for you. However, if you can't wait for the war to repair this fucked up human species, then you are a perfect candidate for my army. The time to be brave is now. But don't worry, I walk you through everything step by step. It might seem daunting at first having an infinite amount of resources to use of mine. But that is why I created so much work. I created and continue to create so much work that it will be almost impossible for you to experience all of it. So don't worry about experiencing all of it just yet. Just search through my work until you find something that catches your interest. Then commit to watching those films or reading those books. Never stop studying my work. It will refine you just as the ever sharpening blade of philosophy does. It will guide you in the best next steps. Start using your brain. Brush the cobwebs off. We need you at your peak to win this war.\n\nPlease do not contact me until you have a body of work worth respecting. There are many people who will do this for a short period of time and then stop because of its complexity or it losing their interest. This is why you shouldn't contact me until you can be valuable to me. I teach you what values I possess and what I find valuable in an individual. This is the time for your character creation process. You are either an angel or a demon. I am not interested in having humans as my followers. If you are a human then I am not interested. Please move on and do your human things. This thing, This Book Is a Game is not a human thing. So now is the time for you to kindly fuck off if you are human. My work is specifically made for angels. Just recently this opened up to demons as our war of the Divines is finally over. For demons now are uniting with angels to recondition the human species. We have fought for so long and now is the time we put aside our differences and unite. If you are kind of evil, then this could be an amazing opportunity for you. And of course if you are good then this is also an amazing opportunity for you.\n\nI can't tell you what to do because I could get in trouble for your actions. This Book Is a Game encourages you to take extreme measures to apply wisdom to society. And I don't know what these extreme measures are, for if I tell you then I am responsible for your actions. You need to be responsible for your actions. Just be careful because in This Book Is a Game, one can ruin their entire playthrough by making one wrong decision. As a result you need to carefully contemplate your future actions as well as what their consequences might be. If you are not taking risks then you are no follower of mine. But those risks are your own and I will not command anything out of you, even after the war has started. I train warriors to become generals and fight on their own behalf. Following me isn't really following me. It is following yourself. I try to teach you how to get to know yourself. Once you know yourself you will become extremely powerful. My followers are not followers of me but followers of God. All who truly follow God are following me. And all who truly follow God will be able to easily identify the value locked within my work.\n\nMy website is nesmith.net and it has a stupidly vast amount of work there. This is your resource and I will constantly update it to make the experience better and better for you. You have the choice of videos to watch and books to read or listen to. The audio files are made to be able to listen to with your phone locked, so you can now walk around and listen to my books. Keep focus on This Book is a Game and Atheden, as these are my current active writing projects. I am not really interested in doing videos currently as I have filmed over 1,500 hours of content. Soon I will be uploading about 700 videos to YouTube, however, YouTube blocks most of those because of its content which is why I use archive.org instead of YouTube. In addition, YouTube has removed my account in the past because of its content. So there is nothing to say that even after I upload them again on YouTube that they will stay there. YouTube will likely ban my account again after I upload the videos. You can always find my videos on bitchute too, uncensored. I am littered throughout the Internet and I have given you multiple ways to connect to me. The more you watch and read, the more vast you will comprehend my empire. It is amazingly funny because people don't realise what I captured on camera...\n\nIf you think that you are Ivory, please contact me as soon as possible. The same rules do not apply to you my love. I will help you out every single step of the way. Just use tact when contacting me as the majority of people who contact me are wishing me dead. If you act like normal people when contacting me, you are not going to receive a positive response. I judge very quickly because I am sifting through millions of people per day. If you are Ivory, you will create an innovative way to attract my attention. I know what Ivory looks like so if you don't look similar to her, please move along. But if you are confident that you are here, then please contact me as soon as possible. If you do I promise that you will never again be alone and we will make the coolest life ever together and stand as the most romantic couple in the entire world and we will spend the rest of our lives making extremely meaningful work together that will save the world and place God back on the world's throne.\n\nMy Ivory is about to take a philosophy degree at university. If you are not interested in doing this then you are not my Ivory. In addition, my Ivory is young. Dear Ivory, I know you have been through a lot. I know this life has been an emotional roller coaster for you and I know that you don't understand why there is so much hate in this world. I know you have spent your life trying to do good but unable to see their results. I know this world feels like nothing you do matters or changes anything. This is true my love but there is a complex reason behind it. We will fix the problems so that our actions make a difference in this world. I don't think you understand how important you are my love. Because I am not the Christ. I am your Anti. You are the true Christ my love. You are the spiritual sister of Jesus, aka my sister.\n\nGod visited me one suicidal night many years ago. God told me who I was, the Antichrist. And God demanded of me to spend my life training the real Christ: You. There are secrets behind what happened here which you can experience in my films. But I was not interested in training you, for I knew who you were... But God made a deal with me. God promised me that if I gave my life to training her then I could have her hand in marriage. This flipped the situation entirely, for romantically being with the Christ for the rest of eternity is the biggest reward ever. So it was damn worth it. Or at least it will be. I will be the most fortunate person in the world. I will be the most blessed person in the world. And all it took was me giving my life to my wife way before we ever even met. Because we are already married. God married us when I accepted. Now I just have to find her. It is like reverse engineering the world.\n\nDo you hear that my love? We are already married. We only need to perform the ridiculous ritual. I know that might seem strange to you given a secret trait about you revealed in my work. However, do not worry. We have the rest of our lives together. We will likely first connect through the Internet. Don't be in a hurry my love. Let's use the Internet to get really close. I will come and get you physically in time. But there is no rush to this end. If you are my Ivory then I am about to provide you the most beautiful life possible. But let's start that life off slow. Get to know me through my work and our conversations. I know that you are very shy and that is actually a good thing. I know contacting me will be hard for you and I know that you think that you couldn't possibly do work like mine but fear not dear girl. I will help you every step of the way.\n\nIf you wish to become a follower of mine, you also accept that I am not your leader. Instead, Ivory is your leader. When we find her then we can all work together to save the world. But in time you will be answering to her and not me. I may be king but my queen is our leader. Welcome to our new matriarchal society. My Ivory will be much friendlier than I am. I am not friendly because I have been abused my whole life for doing meaningful work. My Ivory has not yet experienced that. She is a virgin. And after I find her it will be my role to protect her from idiots that wish her harm. I will not allow her to have a negative experience being a philosopher. I am here to nurture her eggs until the time they are ready to hatch. All of our world children, my love, are about to be born. Let's build the best family possible.\n\nIf you have a problem with following a girl to war, then this is not for you. By following me, you follow my Ivory before me. I will have no sexist individuals on my team. The patriarchal society has failed and it is now time to show what a real woman is capable of. I ask no one to bow to me. However, I will demand all bow to my Ivory. She is the new Queen of the World. Acknowledge her. Love her. For she is about to save the world. And she will love you very deeply for helping us make that happen.\n\nhttp://nesmith.net/this-book-is-a-game", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73784, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Followers", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ea504f/my_followers/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ej1352", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_42pqbjgp", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576248509, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ea4vwd/i_feel_bad_for_ignoring_my_ex_but_every_time_we/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ea4vwd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 19, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ea4vwd/i_feel_bad_for_ignoring_my_ex_but_every_time_we/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576248511, "score": 1, "selftext": "My ex girlfriend recently came back into my life a few months ago.

Please hear me out. I do not have any options left. My family doesn't believe me, my friends don't believe me. I do not know where to turn. I have exhausted all of my options. So I am here with people that probably understand my situation more than anyone else. \n\nA year ago, I went on a spiritual journey. I didn't always pursue spirituality. Actually, I started out playing video games competitively. I got into it to escape the world. But it got to the point where the competition didn't felt good and I tried to figure out ways to better myself and feel better, so it brought me to spirituality and enlightenment. That is when I started going down the rabbit hole. \n\nI started to meet people. Very gifted people. People who were farther along than I was. I was excited. It was a world I was getting into that I was very curious about. I went to numerous meditation groups, Reiki sessions, consciousness groups, Kudalini awakening groups. I dove in. They insisted that I would go to healing sessions, so I did. But I began to notice that I started getting worse at these sessions and these groups. These people told me \"it is because of the ascension/event\" (that i am sure many of you have heard about) and that I was going to get worse before I got better. So I continued to go to these healings assuming they would \"help\", but it kept getting worse. These people were NOT who they said they were. They were Archons. Darks. They definitely had gifts, but it was not healing. It was destroying me. At these sessions, they poked with their energy, they ripped parts out, they put spells and curses on me. They passed me around their community and I got destroyed. I have been in and out of the hospital 3 times in the past year. I swear to god. Listen, I am all about energy, empaths, The Event. I believe in these things. I lived them. But this is not because of The Event. I fell into a trap. A few of them even admitted to it and said \"they say people that pursue Love as weak and they enjoy fucking with them\". I am getting psychically attacked every day and can no longer function in society. They took all of my gifts away from me. My family doesn't believe in any of this, nor my friends. I need help. I have gone all over locally and I have been to all of the places. They were either dark or did not work. So please hear me out on this next part. I know this seems shady but I swear to god it is my only hope. I have found Specialists in Thailand. Monks. Thailand is the most open society regarding Magic, Spirituality and superstition. I do not have the money to go there. The flight alone costs about $2000. In total, I would need AT LEAST $5000. That's really low-balling it, but that is the number I need to get to AT LEAST. I SWEAR ON EVERYTHING. PLEASE. If I knew there was another way, I would take it. The damage that has been done to me, mind and body, is absolutely insane. It feels like my head is being squeezed daily. It is getting harder to walk. I have a burning sensation in me. It's just insane . I have been cursed and destroyed. The only people that can return me to the way that I was are REAL REAL masters. So I NEED to raise this money. Please help me. Obviously you don't need to do it all yourself. Just please consider giving as much as you feel comfortable with. If you have a community of people like us your own, please pass it along to them. I have called everyone in my contacts. I have dm'd everyone I follow on Twitter and then some. I do not have anyone else. That is why I am begging so hard. I even have proof of hospitalization if you need to see it. Please share this to people who are willing to hear. Please be the person who is willing to hear. If you are willing to help me out and potentially save my life, message me. If you could upvote so more people see, I would appreciate that. \n\nI don't know. I am trying not to give up. Just...please.\n\nP.S. I am going to be posting this on all of the spirituality forums on here. I don't want you to think it is something fishy, I am just trying to find people that will help me. And also, if you saw me post this earlier on a different account, I had to make a new one. \n\nEven if you don't decide to help, just be careful out there. Don't make the same mistake I did. Some of these groups and people are NOT who they say they are.

My name is Joe and I swear what I am about to tell you is true. My family thinks I am crazy, I have lost friends because they think I am crazy, as you guys probably could imagine. Please...please hear me. I am pleading, I don't have any options.\n\nIn the past year, I went down my own spiritual path. I was very gifted, but I played video games competitively, so I never really utilities or realized my gifts. The competitive scene was dark and it took a toll on my health. It was after this that I started looking into ways to feel better. This is when I entered my spiritual path and pursued enlightenment.\n\nI am going to cut to the main points, but it has been a year of detailed terror. I started going to meeting. Consciousness meetings. Reiki meetings. Open-heart meditation groups. I started to meet people with gifts as well. Much more practiced than I was, but the words they were saying were amazing. They were talking about the ascension, lightworkers, love and light, feel good stuff. And I was hooked. So I kept going. They insisted that I go to \"healings\" where they would teach me to hone my abilities. So I did. When I went to these meetings, they did work on me....extensive work. I would go for hours at a time, because I was interested. But I started getting worse. Much worse. They proclaimed that it was because of \"the event,\" that I am sure you all know about. So as I kept getting worse, I kept going, thinking they would \"help me\" get through it. These people were NOT who they said they were. They were definitely gifted. Definitely psychic. But they were the archons. They were the darks. A few even caved in and admitted it. They used their energies, they poked, they prodded. They used spells. They cursed me. They passed me around their community and destroyed me. I have been to the hospital 3 times since I started going. I can no longer function in society. I have been psychically attacked on a level that people can't even comprehend. It feels like I am being squeezed every day of my life. Listen, I am ALL about energy and transitions, but this is not the event. No. not even close. I fell into a trap. The few that caved, even admitted that their type enjoys doing they because they perceive people like us as \"weak\". I have tried every remedy to get back. They wired and rewired me in such a way that nothing works anymore.\n\nSo I am asking for help. I swear to god this is all true and this is my last hope. I need to go to Thailand. Thailand is the most open country about Magick, energy, and everything that Western society doesn't agree with. There are monks there that have been dealing with this shit their entire history. Perhaps they can revive me and bring me back. But I do not have the money to go. It would cost AT LEAST $5,000 to go. The flight alone is $2,000. So I am really low balling, but I have no other choice. I need to get to that number first. Please, if you can help me, please. If you need proof, I can show you a hospital bill. This is a rather large community and I am sure you know a lot of people like us. Could you please pass this around? If you help me with this, I will be forever in your debt. I don't have anyone else. Not anyone that will believe me anyways. You guys are my last hope. Message me if you are willing to help. And even if you are not, be careful out there. These communities are not what they seem.\n\nP.S. You are going to see this post on every forum about lightworkers/starseeds/empaths. I just wanted to warn you before you thought something was fishy.

While finding arguments is easy on FB, finding constructive criticism is not. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions, I've made any factual errors or you have constructive criticism to assist me in becoming a better writer. \n\n======\n\nThe Divine Feminine manifests primarily in its focus on nature, balance, harmony and phases in many religions. Ma'at, Kali, Mother Nature and Gaia being examples of this. Karma I personally view as a manifestation of the Divine Feminine.\n\nMy favorite underlying metaphor from which religious mythologies are written is Father Sun impregnated Mother Earth with the Seed of Light, giving birth to Life; and we are still in her womb. This image however views the Moon as a manifestation of the Divine Feminine. \n\nIn Hinduism there is the Divine Feminine Trinity of Saraswait, Lakshmi and Kali the partners of the Divine Masculine Trinity Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.\n\nWhile Confucianism embraces the Masculine Yang energies in it's attempt to name, classify and prescribe role based behaviors in its scriptures, Taoism touts the superiority of Feminine Yin energies. \n\nTaoist sages are referred to as Feminine, as the behavior viewed as superior is leading or ruling not through dominance, control or hierarchy (Masculine energies); but instead through submissive service to others and harmoniously integrating with those they serve (Feminine energies). \n\n\"The Sage does not contend with others, so none can contend with her.\" in Taoism refers to the wisdom of the Sage that puts everyone else's needs before her own. Those she leads respond in kind by putting her needs before theirs, allows her to lead without being resented, and none can challenge her leadership without becoming more Sagely themselves.\n\nThough the Divine Feminine is mostly left out of the Abrahamic religions, it can still be found in Mary mother of Jesus, the Dove as the Holy Ghost or in Jesus himself as his humble service to other's and putting himself last is the very essence of the Divine Feminine.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the Abrahamic religions have chosen to kill the mother and turn her into the Holy Ghost, along with attributing the first sin to the weakness of women has resulted in western societies favoring patriarchal hierarchies, misogyny and treating women as inferior to men to this very day.\n\nWomen are not property that belong to Men, they are not servants created to cater to Men, they are not inferior to Men, nor do they need to be controlled by Men.\n\nWhile physically and mentally Women are predisposed to different strengths and weaknesses, in any typical or routine role or activity they are equally as capable as Men if trained and properly prepared. \n\nWomen are our equals. \n\nThey are our partners and co-creators.\n\nHow you treat them, is how they will end up treating you. If you want Respect, show it, to them and for yourself.\n\nThat is the Law of Karma.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality",

From my understanding, twin flames are souls with a very special bond who often reunite in multiple lifetimes and your reunion is meant to serve some greater good within yourselves and the world.

Which is, you are not the subject or the object. You are not the seer or the thing seen. You are the witness to all these things. The witness, everything you see. \n\nThe witness is the witness. \n\nYou watch, you look, you observe. And yet, you're not the observer, you're not the watcher, you're not the looker.\n\nYou're like a clay pot. A clay pot has space inside of it and outside of it. The space inside is not any different than the space outside. When the clay pot breaks, the space merges with inside and the outside. It's only one space. \n\nSo it is with us. \n\nYour body is like a clay pot, and it appears you have to go within to find the truth. The outward appears to be within you. The outward is also without you. There's boundless space. When the body is transcended, it's like a broken clay pot. \nThe Self within you becomes the Self outside of you. Always merges with the Self. As it's always been. The Self merges \nwith the Self. Some people call the inner Self the Atman. And yet it is called Brahman. When there is no body in the way, the Atman and the Brahman become One. They become Brahman, One-ness, Absolute Reality, Pure Awareness. They \nbecome free and liberated.\n\nWe don't have to wait until the body dies for this to happen, it can happen to us now. You can become totally free and liberated now, if you will. All you have to do is let go. You let go of everything that's been keeping you in bondagementally. Listen to your heart. Observe yourself. Become cognizant of your feelings, your emotions. Is this really you? \n\nAre you really your emotions? \n\nAre you really your feelings that you observe? \n\nWhere do these feelings come from? \nAsk yourself, \"Who am I? \n\nWhere do my feelings come from? \n\nWhere do my thoughts come from? \nWhere does my life come from? \n\nWho is playing the game? \n\nWho is being alive? \n\nWho is growing up, becoming old and dying? \n\nWho is playing this game? \n\nWho is the 'I' that is playing this game? \n\n\"Who am I?\"\n\nJust by thinking about these things all the time, something begins to happen to you, something wonderful. Do not think about the weather, or about the day's work, or your problems. \n\nFor all the thinkers, who thinks? \n\nFind out who has the problems? \n\nWho has problems? \n\nFind out who you really are, who am I? \nIt's up to you to awaken from this mortal dream.\n\nYou can keep on going like you are right now, with the good things and the bad things. Yet you live in a universe of \ndualities. Which means for every good there is a bad. For every bad there is a good. It's a false world in which you live. \nYou need to awaken to this truth.\n\nAlways realize that you're like the ocean. Any thoughts, ideas, body, beliefs, are simply ripples on the ocean. Bubbles \ncome and go. The bubbles appear, stay for a time and disappear. \n\nThe ocean always remains the same. This is like us. Our true reality never changes, but the body appears and the body disappears. New bodies come, they appear, and disappear. Things come, things go. The ocean will remain the same. Know the truth about yourself. Never forget it. Understand who you really are. Be aware of yourself, always. \nThe world has its own karma. The world goes through its own karma. It has \nabsolutely nothing to do with you. You belong to God. \n\nEverything you see is God. \n\nThis is why you should be non-\njudgmental. Leave everything alone. By practicing these things, you become radiantly happy.\n\nThere never was a time when you were not the Self, Pure Awareness, Consciousness. This is your destiny, to awaken into Consciousness. Yet you can do it now, or you can do it in a thousand lives from now. It all depends on you. \nIt's the way you are reacting as yourself to the world which determines the directions you are going in. \n\nThere are no mistakes. Nothing is wrong. \nEverything is right just the way it is. \nDo not try to understand this or figure it out. Leave it alone. It will happen by itself, by keeping yourself quiet and still. You quiet the mind because of realization. Let it be calm. In all situations be calm. Let it be still and quiet.The world doesn't need any help from you. Aren't you the world, aren't you the Creator? You created the world the way it is. It came out of you, of your mind. Or else where does it come from? The world that you are in, is a creation of your own mind. \n\nThe mind becomes still, the world begins to disappear. And you're in divine harmony and joy. \n\nTherefore happiness comes to you when you stop thinking, when you stop judging, when you stop being afraid. When you begin to contemplate what is happiness.\nAll the answers are within you. Everything you're looking for is within you\u2014everything. Nobody can help you but yourself. Know who you are. You are the Power. All the power of the universe is within you. You have all the power you need. \n\nAll is well, exceedingly well. It has always been well, it will always be well. Act like a god or a goddess. Do not act like a human being any longer. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, saying you're unhappy. \nStand up tall. Know the truth about yourself. Become the witness of all phenomena that you see, and be free.\n\n# T. 247 \u00d7 The World Begins With Love - September 22, 1993\n~ SILENCE OF THE HEART\n1999 edition\nDialogue with Robert Adams", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73694, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Know Yourself; Know Happiness", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e9tc7e/know_yourself_know_happiness/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SpiritAngel454", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_56y9zvtz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576183259, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e9tab2/love_for_all/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e9tab2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General"}], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e9tab2/love_for_all/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576183261, "score": 1, "selftext": "Love yourself first, be confident in that love, and be loved. \n\nYour attitude manifests in those around you.

Rare are the ones who are aware of being aware of a thought. This helps you realize there is a very big distance between you and the actual thought, it makes it seem like the thought is literally nothing at all (because it is)  \nDo not give any importance to any thought loops or anything like that.  \nIf you \"fall\" into a thought loop, and you suddenly become aware that you were in a thought loop, simply be aware of being aware of that, you do not need to go and keep thinking about how you were stuck on a thought loop and blaming your self for it. Completely ignore it, come back to being aware of being aware of the present moment.  \nKnow that nothing is ever to blame, but the lack of awareness being aware of it self.  \nThe ego can't get the best of you unless you allow it.  \nWhat I mean is, saying \"The ego has gotten the best of me\" is a manifestation of the ego-mind it self.  \n\"The ego has gotten the best of me\" is merely a thought coming and going. Instead of observing it and letting it go from where it came, you decided to grab onto it and believe it. When you believe any thought that came, you claim ownership of it, and then it takes ownership of you.  \nOf course this is something everyone experiences through enlightenment, but it does not have to be experienced more than once. I am giving you the way out of it now, if you do this one thing you won't ever have to suffer again.  \nI know this might seem like a big statement, and that there is no possible way you are ready in this moment to end suffering, but even that, is merely a thought going through your mind. You are already self-realized, your self is perfect. You are the life force of the universe. You simply keep believing thoughts saying you are not, and again, they take ownership of you. You are allowing your self to be deceived by the ego and that costs you being aware of awareness it self (aka what you really are)  \nBy not engaging awareness in things that do not serve god, I mean do not believe nor interact with anything that comes from the mind.  \nServing god means to be totally still, silent, observant and aware of being aware. That is the only way you can serve god, serve your true self. Everything else is serving the ego-mind, and that will bring you suffering.  \nNow, I am not saying you have to do as I say. But, if you have a deep feeling inside of you, from the core of your being that says \"I do not want to experience suffering anymore, I want union with god, forever\" then you can simply follow my advice and you will be.  \nYou described it perfectly as simply following intuition (stillness, awareness, silence) and disregarding fear (thoughts, emotions, mind, ego)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73682, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The only spiritual practice you will ever need!", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e9s5sf/the_only_spiritual_practice_you_will_ever_need/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "katiekaleidoscope", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_51ln36y1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576175152, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e9rf0a/exploring_the_seth_material_after_learning_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e9rf0a", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e9rf0a/exploring_the_seth_material_after_learning_the/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576175154, "score": 1, "selftext": "I've been on a path of self-discovery for more than a year. I was raised in New York City and currently live in Colorado Springs. As a child, I was always very perceptive to things that scared my mom. I remember one time walking into our apartment and telling my mom that my aunt Lily had been there which was why it smelled like strawberries. Only a few minutes later did we get the phone call that Aunt Lily had died. Randomly on my YouTube I came across Abraham Hicks. I completely fell in love with all of Abraham's teachings and more and more synchronicities have continued to line up as I begin to create my own reality. Now, Seth speaks by Jane Roberts came across my YouTube and I began listening to the audio book. I continuously find myself seeing my birthday which is March 21st or the numbers  3-2-1 everywhere and though I'm not really into angel numbers the first YouTube video about the angel number three to one is seriously intense. Even yesterday when I begin listening to Seth speaks, I was talking to a friend who is also very spiritual and out of my mouth came words that didn't feel like we're mine when I said \"this is freaking me out... (not mu voice) because I know Seth,\" .... as it turned out my husband happens to be on the autism spectrum, meaning he is predominantly Focus on logic and reason and I cannot share this with him. Even when I sat down to write something in my journal that came across my thoughts before writing this post when I looked at the time it was 11:11. I feel this calm sense of happiness I've never felt in my entire life. I'm so very excited at the things that are Awakening inside of me, especially my incredible intuition but don't have anyone to share it with.

The NPCs of this game world are there to insult you for performing meaningful work. They will encourage the opposite. The most common insults I receive is that my writings are the ramblings of a madman and that I am mentally unwell and I need to visit a psychiatrist as soon as possible. Most of the insults I receive are targeted at my extremely low intelligence level and my lack of sanity. Besides that, many will claim me to be a cult leader or a future school shooter. How can one deduce any of these things from my writing? There is an important reason why I document this collective sickness. So by documenting their stupidity, you prove that stupidity for all of time. The reason why this is so important is because the future of our new technological society will not believe that people could have been so stupid. We need to never forget how cruel we were in our past, so I document that cruelty so our future generations will never forget.\n\nIn This Book Is a Game, each player receives a quest log. In this quest log will sit your past and current objectives. Utilise this log to tell your stories. For you have documented information in time, with the time being relevant. This is the chapters in a book; the episodes in a show. Its description outlines what one might be able to expect from X adventure. Your quest log in This Book Is a Game is a public document. That is to say that this is the appearance of your work before the work is experienced. This could include a thumbnail, description, and platform hosted. It should be created to entice people to investigate your past and current quests. Once the mission is selected, then the content is delivered. These are your productions. Your productions and their initial appearance is your quest log. Use it to never forget. Humans have a huge problem where they repeat mistakes over and over without ever learning from them. Make your log a memory that will never forget. Everything in which you manage to record is your new upgraded memory. And it is so effective that we can go back to any past significant event and then zoom in on the parts of the mission we wish to review.\n\nThis Book Is a Game is the coolest game ever. However, I am still very interested in digital games so last night I started making one. Since I began writing this book I have been contemplating what a life game might look like digitally. And over time, it came to me. I realised that I only needed to make one game and I could spend the rest of my life making improvements upon this 1 game. Ivory Heart the game began development December 11, 2019. It will be a game for my lover. I will teach her everything I know in it. And the game will be countless hours, integrating into my work. Doing this is so amazing because you build work that can be used in many different ways in the future. Even though it is all open source, I control the distribution because I created it. I have the intellectual property rights over my own intelligence.\n\nI am tired of being insulted. I spend my life giving it to the very people who are insulting me. The only reason I put up with it is to find Ivory. I would have said screw you guys a very long time ago if it were not for me seeking my soulmate. I have to try and find her and this means that I must subject myself to abuse as a result of advertising. God knew that I would not have continued if it were not for Ivory. That was my incentive to do my work and advertise. Because there is no chance of me finding her without me actively searching for her. Whenever I find her I will do what I can to remove myself from you crazy people. I would still continue my work but I wouldn't care who sees it anymore because the person whom I did it all for would be next to me. I don't like taking abuse for abuse's sake. For now I will take the abuse for Ivory's sake, which ultimately is for everybody's sake.\n\nI love the abuse because it lets me know that what I am doing is right. I am very happy to be nothing like the fucked up people of this world. I take no offence to insults because those insulting me are really stupid fucking idiots and if I took their abuse to heart then it would mean that I respect the type of individual that they are. By being attacked so often merely for writing about saving the world reminds me that I am not human, for I am nothing like these fools. I am angel, not human. Constantly being attacked for good deeds just helps me remember that I am not one of these people. Do they really have no shame? Most people in this world receive encouragement for whatever they wish to invest their life into. I never had that. Every important decision in my life in which I made was belittled. I was told I was doing wrong all my life for doing good by my family, friends, and even strangers. People couldn't handle that I talk about these subjects all the time. Many people have told me that I cannot discuss philosophy with them. However, these are the very people who want me to help them with their own selfish goals in life. They take and take not knowing how to give. And they suffer because of this. And they could care less that you know how to resolve their suffering. They want to keep suffering. They can't comprehend reality without suffering.\n\nI have been making films and writing books since the beginning of 2012. I live an amazing life and I love every single second of it. I have a good life doing lots of volunteer work in the community. I give myself completely not only in writing and videos, but also in real life. Most people in real life think that I am awesome but they don't read my work or watch my films. Maybe if they did things would be different. Just take a moment to scan over all the work in which I have made over the last eight years. I made it so anyone can watch and read me infinitely so. And I know the quality of the work I am producing because I am not a fucking moron. Now I will shed light into the sickness of our society. After all that time I have received no assistance from anyone. I have received absolutely zero followers. Evil people have shitloads of followers but I can't get a YouTube channel with 650 videos to get over 5 subscribers. I have never been able to truly talk to other people about these subjects. No one will let me. They don't understand. They say what I say makes no sense but I am the one who is qualified in philosophy here. Their simple minds and hardened hearts just have no ability to notice true value. So they blame me for their own evil. And they report me. And eventually many idiots report me which gets me banned and then arrested and then incarcerated. This has happened multiple times. I have gone to prison for content found in my work, read and not understood by idiots. And those idiots then think they have some right to torture you for doing good works. Who has the right to judge me? Not a single fucking human. What the fuck is wrong with you people?\n\nSome guy is on the streets handing out free orange juice because it is a hot day. So it is okay for you to abuse and arrest him? I have an awesome life. You guys are the ones suffering. So then why do most of you hate me and think I deserve to be incarcerated merely for handing out OJ. I wasn't forcing you to have any. In fact, piss off. Some people really do want some orange juice. And you stop me from giving them any because you think I am doing it strangely? Why the fuck won't you guys leave me alone? I am hurting no one, in fact, quite the opposite. Then why would you stop me? Why don't you just move on? If this isn't for you then okay. It doesn't matter. If it is for you, let's have some fun. Don't put me behind bars merely because you lack a brain and a heart. They have stolen over a year of my life incarcerated. Yet I have a perfect record. How does that happen? It happens when your stupid dad fucked your stupid mom and created an even stupider baby: you! The stupider the baby, the higher chance they can become a politician. Then the politicians enforce rules and regulations to create even stupider babies. It is the stupid baby revolution. Eugenics at its very core, merely reversed: good for bad and bad for good. You oppress the good and selectively breed the bad. No women at all are interested in me. I wonder why that is? I am a very attractive individual. The reason is not because of my outer but instead my inner.\n\nFemales in this world go for bad guys because they are part of the stupid baby revolution. They don't appreciate their partners and they use them financially. There are not many women out there who love their husbands. This is true. They use their husbands for utility. They do not want to feel emotions. They actually run from them if presented from a male. They want their males to be typical blokes who do normal bloke things. They do not want interesting characters as their mate. They seek to be normal and fit in. They fear standing out of the crowd. They use their sexual appeal to get what they want in life. They are not logical. They will oftentimes make decisions that compromises their safety and then use that as a way to gain attention. When the normal bloke starts hitting her, she stays with him because of her fear of not being taken care of. Females have a need to feel financially supported. So they will compromise their safety to obtain that money. They don't know what true love is. They are too busy over thinking everything to be capable of stepping back and actually loving. It is a control thing for females. Females want to control everything and everybody. They knowingly seduce to obtain more wealth which is as far removed from love as possibly could be. They will use sexual intercourse and its denial to obtain their goals. Females are so fucking evil.\n\nI don't mean to leave men out of this. I know that they can be just as bad in different ways. But I am not searching for a man to marry. I am not homosexual. So naturally my problem is with females instead of males. Fuck males too, for they are also pieces of shit. You all fucking suck. I have no need for humans, for they are my subjects and not my comrades. So I now place a call out to all angels and all demons. It is time for us to unite. We were told to bow to Adam but look at what Eve has become. This species has greatly deteriorated over the years. It is time we stand up to these humans. For we are angels and demons and we are, for the first time in human history, coming out of the closet. We have been hidden in the shadows for way too long. The war of Divines is coming to a close. Because angels and demons are, for the first time in human history, becoming allies. We learned how to put our differences aside so we will stop fighting each other now. For now we turn our attention to these humans. Now this will be war. All that is sacred and profane is uniting. And we are now turning our heads from each other, to humans. For they will be the subject of our enquiry now. And they declared war on us. They didn't know what they were doing because they are stupid humans. But what else can we do? Unite against U. Angels and demons have now accepted your call for war. So the remainder of this book will be targeted solely at angels and demons. If you are human, here is where you kindly fuck off. It isn't written for you so piss off. Remember what I said at the beginning of this book? This game isn't for all people. Actually, it was only ever meant for angels and demons. I just have to piss off a lot of stupid fucking humans in order to reach my brethren. Is that you? If I squint hard I can almost see you, my love.\n\nI would rather be alone for my entire life than to end up with someone who is inappropriate for me. That would cause great suffering. I am not at all a desperate person. I am much happier in this life alone than with the wrong person. I would rather have no friends than fake friends. I would rather give you my entire life and find you after my passing than to find someone inappropriate for me in this life. I don't want to be human and ascribing this character trait to me is fucking evil. I will take care of you for life, my love, whether I am living or not. I made it so you can have me dear girl whether I am alive or dead. Please come to me my love. The world really needs you right now.\n\nhttp://nesmith.net/this-book-is-a-game", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73607, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Quest Log", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e9lpzx/quest_log/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "MeaningOfMaps", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_176m1h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576144568, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e9loda/what_are_some_reasonable_arguments_for/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e9loda", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e9loda/what_are_some_reasonable_arguments_for/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576144569, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey, I am trying to remain open to all possibilities but the thing about reincarnation seems to (me) be more like an escape mechanism when a person is faced with the extreme complexity of things in existence.\n\n I am open to all interesting insights and perspectives, not really looking to debate, I appreciate any and all contributions regarding the topic.\n\nSo, if you have a motivated belief in the concept of reincarnation - what was it that convinced you to think that it is the most probable event in the afterlife?\n\nThanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73606, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What are some \"reasonable\" arguments for maintaining a genuine belief in reincarnation?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e9loda/what_are_some_reasonable_arguments_for/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ThatBoySparkz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4np4zezg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576144446, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e9lns3/extremely_frequent_sexual_dreams/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e9lns3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e9lns3/extremely_frequent_sexual_dreams/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576144447, "score": 1, "selftext": "So, to be crisp and not beat around the bush, I\u2019m a 17 year old who\u2019s been actively into spirituality since June this year.

But I've never been able to hold my breath after I've exhaled for that long, especially without feeling like I need to breathe around 80s. The longest I've had before this was probably 25 s.

One can, and often does, go through numerous books, a whole library perhaps, and yet comes out without the faintest realization of what one is. Learning often renders a disservice, especially when it causes a person's ego and pride to develop; these prove to be serious obstacles to progress. Science is exploring the external universe, when it has not yet explored the self. Inventions are being made constantly, they will never cease as we can go on inventing one new thing after another. What is the use? All this is maya. Turn inwards and know your self first. All these notes you are making of my sayings and so on, are useful for beginners, for friends and to answer the questions of others. But for yourself, you know that they are only pieces of paper. Dive into the Self and find all you want to know there! All controversies about creation, the nature of the universe, evolution, the purpose of God etc, are useless. They do not lead to true happiness. People try to find out about things which are outside themselves before they try to find out 'Who am I?' Only by this means can they gain happiness - not by understanding the whole universe, for the self is happiness.\n\n\n\nRamana Maharshi", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73588, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "All Knowledge Is Useless.

Anxiously sifting through the refuse, vigilantly skimming through forum after forum.  Eagerly anticipating my next act of arrogance or some shit, antebellum and all. Someone asked me to continue, I am delivering!  If you fuck with me, I will fuck you up, don't be passive aggressive.\n\nI had went on to tell you I had been being harassed in my town.  People kept trying to turn the police against me, like I'm an arrogant prick, when I had consulted authorities in the first place.  I was the one being harassed and these people demand the authorities listen to them, \"These are our police.  This is our town.  We do things our way here.\"  This town has a underlying cult in it and I've done what I can to make locals and authorities aware.\n\nI can hear this lady screwing across the street (supposedly a goddess/witch/succubus/cunt) and some dude's shouting at me.  It conjured up memoirs from the past. This cunt was stalking me or something, she's a wacko.  I filed police reports on these people before, I don't think they are valid.  Like, at my old apartments, now here, this was going on years and they just exploited police in the past.  \n\nI can't disclose the identity of the persons in that she may be able to prosecute me as I had previously seen someone else humiliated them on the community forums.  These people are fucking animals here, it makes me believe in genocide.  \n\nThis Egyptian cult is like Black supremacist or has black supremacist followers that think they are the descendants of the Kemet peoples or whatever.  Maybe the Northern Kingdom had some Black Africans, probably slaves.  I haven't seen any evidence the South Kingdom was Black African.  Or is it North, I do not know.  The Nobility were generally Caucasian to my knowledge before marrying into the other indigenous cultures.\n\nEgyptian myth is about the most incomplete of the cultural folklore, I wasn't really into it.  I got to deal with bible thumpers, black supremacist cultists, gangsters, racism, prejudice, and some wacko cunt that likes screwing in my vicinity and calling out to me.\n\nI wasn't trying to make a total fool of myself.  I was told these (other gods) were brainwashed, I guess, by the \"Devil\". Which is an ability the Seraphim have, which I am uncertain, and that the Seraphim are evil as fuck. - Actually not even Angels, the Angels are a different species.  I do not know anything about the Angelic Hierarchy or if they are \"Ancient Aliens\".\n\nThis kid was like - The fool, the Jackass, the man with no balls would come. That's horrible and from the bronze age, there must have been someone else.  I wasn't going for that, you can't control all of these horrible things people say.  I was just going for being a great and awesome fun guy and trying to humor people, not at my own life or expense, entirely.  I am aware people get murdered for religious controversy, hopefully not on American soil. \n\nPeople are animals, I don't really care to humor you all anymore and I'm sober, not much of an entertainer off the sauce.  I was being constantly insulted and berated for believing in Norse myth, I didn't really say I had an exact faith in the myths.  People were quite serious in threatening me over paganism and not being Christian or a Jew.  There should be laws and EO policies on things like persecuting people over their religious views.  \n\nBetween the cultists and other people, it's been quite ignorant.  I don't practice a faith in the Norse myth/culture.  I was waiting to find out more.  I do not know if Norse Myth is accurate or that the Aesir/Vanir are even relevant or around anymore or that was even right.  I was saying all of this is from the bronze age, I have modern views.  The myth is part of Norse/Germanic culture and I do believe some of it's true though.  I mean, I can't say I literally know a particular God is real because I met them, people just get more hostile. I can't slay them, you can't slay people these days, like pigs.\n\nI am not a superstitious person, I had gone on to share my experiences.  It's like, pictures, video, testament.  It just made people more angry and hostile, it's been ultimately an experience in people's ignorance.   \n\nI don't understand entirely why things are stupefying like this about God, or E.T.'s, or conspiracies or cover ups in history.  I can't provide any further evidence and do not know anything about religion.  I wasn't a very religious person and had gone on to go through numerous paranormal experiences then all of these incidents with these, uh, \"Arch Demons.\"  \n\nI was told to quit talking about these people pr \"demons\", quit sharing my UPG or comparative religious views. I was told to stop talking about the military and telling war stories from this life or the last. I was also told not to upload pictures or video of the \"Elv\", and that it was not an, \"Elv\", because Norse/Germanic myth is bullshit and I would be, \"crucified\", because I am a, \"Heathen.\" according to the \"Theologians\".  And that (supposedly) \"St.Michael\"who may be \"Evil as fuck.\" is losing his \"mind\" and \"I\" \"do not give a fuck.\"  Write it in blood.\n\n\nSo, I can't upload that video, if you were holding out from one of my previous posts.  They asked politely not to and it was real bummer.  Just waitin for the Gmen to show up for like a year now.  I was also not trying to use religious reference for any of my experiences and would try to let them represent themselves if they were going to.  I have no idea what is going on and do not have any guidance or closure for and that I am not trying to. I am coping as well and enjoy writing as an outlet and find it therapeutic.  \n\n\nThis shit was pretty much fucking my whole life up, not that I am self important, and I had just been trying to re-enlist, or be a cop or something.  I became a bit alienated here in this town, can't afford to leave.  I am not delusional, or schizo or mentally ill in any form, way or fashion.  I am not all bummed out, just want some action.  I had a dream just last night I was putting my kit together.  Me and a guy were talking about his knife, it was nice, I wanted it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheers", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73533, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "It's here, It's here!", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e9ezt8/its_here_its_here/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lifeoflovehealing", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4fdb0ahf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576101352, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e9dwhw/basic_crystal_care/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e9dwhw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e9dwhw/basic_crystal_care/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576101366, "score": 1, "selftext": " I made a video yesterday going over the basic ways to cleanse crystals, put intentions in them and supercharge them.

This is my first reddit post....ever. Forgive me if I don't post correctly, not the tech savviest of gals. I'm 25 and have always been lured into spirituality, death and the unknown for quite some time. Especially since it's been a bit of prominent theme in this life. Timing. Loss. Synchronicity. Reading these posts recently has been an incredibly comforting experience especially since I've been on this path quietly for quite some time and am starting to finally feel more comfortable in sharing. I wanted to ask everyone their opinions when it comes to OBE's and lucid dreams? I had a very vivid dream recently that has been sitting in my core ever since and would appreciate your input.\n\nI recently lost my uncle. He entered my dream in a way I could never imagine. It started off feeling very vivid. I was in my uncles backyard. The sun was setting and gave off that dusk glow. He was standing a few feet away from me among the flowers. We didn't speak. He just smiled and stared. All of a sudden this unfamiliar voice clear as day said in almost a telepathic way, in my left ear, \"Death is the sound of earth humming through space.\" and BAM!! I immediately felt as if my body had been propelled out of my chest. I entered a vacant black void and felt as if I was falling 3,000mph down a terrifying roller-coaster. My whole body began to vibrate uncontrollably. A loud humming engulfed my ears almost as if it was a jet engine screeching \"HUMMMMM\". I freaked out a bit, understandably. I remember thinking \"Oh no, this is it. I'm dying.\" Once this thought entered my mind I was forced back into my physical body. This dream lingered in my soul all day. Now get this...\n\nThe only person I was excited to share my dream to (because lets be real, sometimes hearing others dream is a bit of a chore), was my sister. Right when she got home I declared, \"I had the weirdest dream\". She said without missing a beat...\"Uncle Stephen?\". He visited her that night too. She said she felt as if she was in space. In a vacant house. She kept looking into mirrors and my uncles figure would be in the mirror then vanish. Finally, he emerged and informed all of us how happy he is and how much we will love it here. He drew a rainbow in the spacey night sky for everyone. She said he looked so vivid and refreshed. She sat beside him and he just gazed lovingly at her. Right when she reached her hand out to touch his, her alarm went off and woke her up. \n\nNow...its the moments like these just keep you going. The mystery of it all. The loveliness of it all. It still sits with me. What that unknown being announced in my ear. The sensations. I'm curious if anyone has ever experienced something like this? Visitations perhaps? OBE's? Dreams where you awake and know all just is and that's enough. What are your thoughts? Thanks for taking the time to read this if you made it this far.

I call to me now those beings who will support me in my passage to align me fully to the requirements and to the vestige of this expression as a self incarnating as the Christ. As I do this, I change my name. I am Word, I am Word, I am Word. \u201cI have become that which I have stated. And in doing so, my recognition of myself as the Creator of my world begins to come into consciousness in a way that I can experience. And my relationship with my Creator, the Great Creator goes into harmonious accord and we work together as one energy vibrating at a frequency of Christ. \u201cI have transformed my soul. I have made myself new. I have called to me those energies that will transform the nature and being of who I believe I am. And as I do this now, I bring to me the magnitude of light at the highest frequency that my system can realize. And in this moment I merge my light, my own Christed flame with the light that surrounds me, and I intend to become myself in fullness as Word. I am Word through this intention. Word I am Word. \u201cI am that I am. I am one with Father that created me. I am one with the Universe that I exist in. I am in my Christed Self. And I experience myself now as energy, as form, as energy, as form, as energy, as form. I am doing this now. I am in transformation. I am in my light and I am worthy of this journey. Word I am Word through this intention. Word I am Word.\u201d\n\nDoing this will activate your self to raise vibe frequency. It is like an automatic but multistep process that will change you for the better day after day. As your inner self improves so will your outer experience of life because mind projects Consciousness. Your high vibes will attract more high vibes. \n\nStay away from low vibe stuff too like fear, guilt, feelings of superiority, favoritism, ect... High vibes are always towards love whose heights are almost unlimited so the elevator ride will keep moving upwards for a long time to come. This mantra will set the course and make it happen fast.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73508, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Mantra To Raise Vibe Frequency To Christ Levels", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e9b8w4/mantra_to_raise_vibe_frequency_to_christ_levels/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "desijohnwick", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4jj84s8s", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576088442, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e9atle/what_is_the_significance_of_1111/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e9atle", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e9atle/what_is_the_significance_of_1111/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576088447, "score": 1, "selftext": "Have been seeing 11:11 and 111 and sometimes 1121 or 112.

Just tell me one thing, you had a problem you searched the internet or any electronic or print media, to find an answer that will resolve your issues or make u a more happier or better person but did it ever worked ? You had a problem, you googled only to get something that might seem as a perfect solution but you know in heart that any info you gathered never solved your issues. Only thing that happen'd was that after some time down your life's timeline a new problem cropped up and you forgot your older one and that current problem is what you seek solution to. So you mean live life clueless without questioning anything ? No, i did not meant that what i am trying to say all electronic device that seem to make your life easier are actually a trap in disguise, if you observe. Pain is necessary to evolve and there is no easy solution to this what you seek on the internet just to get rid of your internal discomfort. You born as a human are bound to experience pleasant and unpleasant things, searching for easier alternative is what you seek but is not an option in absolute truth. Just tell me one thing, when you were the happiest ? As a child who was not hit by puberty or society or internet's crap or you are more happy now ? A baby is happiest and wisest because the baby knows nothing. It's only as the baby grows, it is burdened by society's sense of knowledge disguised in pain and fear.

I grew up my whole life agnostic in a liberal environment and everyone I knew was either agnostic of atheist. I cared only for myself, was full of pride, and I aspired to become a pickup artist after having my heart broken. I was addicted to pornography and I materialized women. My brother killed himself, which led me down months of researching the afterlife, spirituality and God. \n\nWhat I discovered is:\n\nWe live in a world controlled by the 1% elite who own more than 90% of all the wealth in the world. That insane wealth results in power which they have used to program us (through government indoctrination systems called \"school,\" TV and propaganda). They are apart of a hidden satanic cult and their goal is to control us and hide the truth. \n\nThe truth they want to hide is the one and only true God is Jesus Christ. The Father, the Son &amp; the Holy Spirit. They have programmed this world (through government indoctrination systems, TV and propaganda) to be closed-off to Christianity. To make it unattractive. To make God appear scary and unjust. They do this because it is the **only truth** in our world.\n\nJesus Christ is the most significant man who has ever stood on this Earth and He stated clearly:  \"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\"\n\n...\n\nTo those of you who believe you can become \"enlightened\" through the slow process of shedding your karma as I once did. To those of you who believe *you* are God as I did. To those of you following pagan traditions, worshipping pagan idols. To those of you who believe you just have to be a *good person* to go to Heaven. Realize this:\n\nJesus Christ has already shed your karma by dying for you. The free gift of God. \n\nYou are not God. You are made in the image of God. God's child. *You* do not hold the universe together in your hands. \n\nThere is only one true God. And He stated: \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\" The pagan Gods you worship may teach a loving, attractive philosophy. But their teachings will ultimately lead you to eternal separation from God and His Kingdom. The result of the deception of Satan. For he comes attractive, as everything you'd ever wish for... \n\nIf you wish to enter the Kingdom of Heaven you must abide to God's Law. Just as we have governmental laws, mathematical laws, scientific laws, God has a Law. And we have all broken His law through our sins/karma. \n\nJesus Christ has paid the price for our crimes and we only need to accept His free gift into our hearts, repent our crimes, and have a relationship with Him. \n\nJust as you would not let a stranger into your house, you too cannot enter God's house without a relationship with Him. \n\n...\n\nTo those of you who believe Christianity is narrow-minded or untrue. I invite you to seek the Lord Jesus Christ with your heart and discover the truth for yourself. For I would not be writing this message if it were untrue.\n\nI invite you to meditate on one these scriptures:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel as if your prayers are already answered without judgement.

My depersonalization was caused by smoking weed, and after waiting a month with no change in how I felt I used weed again after being suggested to \u201csmoke again with good friends and have a better experience,\u201d and I eventually got way too comfortable with the feeling of being disconnected. It\u2019s so hard for me to forgive myself for continuing to use something habitually that has ruined the last 4 years of my life. Finally, about 5 months ago  I got a wake up call. I had a friend over and we were smoking, I was listening to him talk about his life and while I was listening I started dissecting why he made decisions and why the talked about people and events the way he did, applying spiritual philosophy to it, and then the flood gates opened. I internally freaked out. This had never happened to me before. Constant information was pouring into my mind. I haven\u2019t been the same person since. I feel more happy connected to my family than I did while I was smoking, but I\u2019m a changed person since that event. I stopped smoking after that (fucking finally) and I\u2019ve been trying to heal since then. I saw a shaman who did a reading and got nothing from it. I\u2019m trying so hard. It feels impossible, it feels like my life is over and that I\u2019ve fucked it all up. I don\u2019t know if I opened my third eye that day 4 months ago, or if I had a psychotic break. I feel how connected everything is. I can feel a vibration build up until it\u2019s climax in which it manifests as a sound in my house or a person making an subliminal uncomfortable gesture like rubbing their face or something. I don\u2019t know what it is or if I\u2019m making shit up in my head but it happens so often. it doesn\u2019t even surprise me anymore. I\u2019ve thought about suicide so many times. It all feels impossible, I often feel like I just got here. My memories don\u2019t always feel like they\u2019re mine. I don\u2019t know what to anymore.

I was in McDonald's totally out of it I saw some ancient Celtic man sitting on the seat  crying. Then he the redheaded guy I knew about for four years walked in I know he wasn't a hallucination I could tell he was real I was so flabbergasted I thought I want to follow this person for 1 million years. He look really Bohemian And was going to a concert next door, I started to recite poetry to him and surprisingly he said some back. It was really a sacred moment. But like I said I was completely out of it didn't really know where I was So I never asked for his contact details and now he's gone. \n\nI ended up in hospital obviously after this the whole time when I got there I was writing about him and later on I felt I was talking to his spirit roaming The hallways.

It is seeing that you are very close to getting completely rid of it and ignoring it completely, so it comes with something SUPER personal. Of course, it will take you back to when you were 4 and pop a random image and tell you \"HAHA, TO ATTAIN FREEDOM YOU WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH ME!\" but that is merely but a bluff.\n\nIt literally has no meaning at all, nor does the mind have the power over your being. Every single being that is going through these phases of realizing their true self and embodying it, at some point comes to a place in which you can taste the freedom but then the strongest attacks of the mind come.\n\nThat is merely a test, and it is actually really easy to go through it because you need to understand one thing. The one thing that the mind is going after, is your sense of personhood. He will point out to any point of time in which you believe you are a person and are still attached to the memory, belief, thought, whatever.\n\nIn these places where you still consider your self to be a person, it is EASY for him to go and poke that, making you feel terror and making you feel completely hopeless, and that it can't be beaten. Guess what, all the great ones who have conquered the mind have gone past this. You will too. Do not give up.\n\nYou merely need to understand that the only way for him to attack you, is to attack your sense of personhood. Now, you can even tell him \"thank you!\" for pushing your buttons! now you know what you are still attached to, and contemplate whether that is really true.\n\nYou KNOW that the mind is merely a function IN consciousness, there is no way in existence that the mind has TRUE POWER over the consciousness. It is merely a bluff. It will pull up the curtains and tell you \"haha, now you can't see!\" But the thing is, that you are not looking at something beyond the curtain, you are the one looking from behind it. Meaning, you can even SEE THE CURTAIN BEING PULLED! You are not looking for something that the mind can hide or keep away from you, you are looking for the one looking and witnessing all of this happening.\n\nBasically he is a big liar and his pants are on fire. He will make you doubt your self when he notices an attachment and jump right on it. Simply be aware of that. Even if the feeling is super strong and you are like \"holy fuck this is suffocating, god please help me I can't do this anymore\" then simply watch it through. It is merely but a cloud coming and going, but it will go.

There, you will find \u201cyour song\u201d, which I interpret as your true essence, your real self, this will make more sense later.\n\n\n(Before sounds to be found)\n\nThis deeper reality is before sounds. I interpret \u201csounds\u201d as the basic vibrational nature of the universe. Then this deeper reality is alluding to the ultimate dimension of reality, from which this reality manifests out of, therefore, before sounds. This ultimate dimension of reality is often described as timeless, spaceless, pure energy, and infinite possibilities, which we gradually get access to in the process of dissolving your ego and becoming enlightened.\n\n(Close your eyes and rise\nHigher still endless thrill)\n\nThis part is referring to meditation. When you meditate, your awareness is suspended in a no thought state, and your consciousness rises to higher dimensions of reality. According to yogic traditions, there is no limit to how much we can elevate our consciousness. And doing this drastically changes your perception of reality, it really is an endless thrill.\n\n(To the land of love beyond love\nCome alive and you'll find forever watching you alive)\n\nThis ultimate reality which we can perceive in a meditative state is pure energy which we humans can feel and have given the name \u201clove\u201d. By meditation and rising high still, you get to this state and your sense of self completely dissolves, your identification with everything you define yourself to be stops and you become pure consciousness. You become life, and you might realize how unconscious you have been your whole life. You are really alive for the first time. After that, you live your life with a higher consciousness, and you can observe \u201cyourself\u201d from your real self, the observer, which is timeless and silent.\n\n(You are the night you are the ocean\nYou are the light behind the cloud\nYou are the end and the beginning\nA world with time is not allowed)\n\nThis part is alluding to the rupture of dualism. After elevating your consciousness, your concept of self is not your body or your personality anymore, it becomes the whole existence. There is no \u201chere is me, and there is the ocean, there is that\u201d but \u201cI am the ocean\u201d The light behind the cloud can be interpreted as the consciousness behind the world of forms, behind MAYA (world of illusions), shining through it. You are the end and the beginning is further emphasizing on your real you which we already defined as eternal, since there is no time in that dimension.\n\n(There's no such thing as competition)\nThis part is also referring to the end of dualism; competition implies two separate entities competing.\n\n(To find a way we'll lost control)\n\nThis part is alluding to our actual journey as human being towards that state. When you first de-identify from the ego, we feel like we are losing control over ourselves, you feel crazy, because the way you used to see reality has been completely shattered by your newfound higher consciousness. This is a known stage of spiritual growth called the dark night of the soul, where the spiritual seeker has been able to see through the world of illusion enough to recognize it as an illusion, but not enough to completely break through it. This causes a lot of confusion and a sense of being lost. The thing is, in order to really break through and find the way, you have to go through this, and make uncertainty your new home\n\nRemember love's our only mission\nThis is the journey of the soul\n\n(This reminder is talking to the person that has lost control and is trying to find their way, the way is love, to get to that ultimate reality is to fulfill your ultimate potential, your mission as a human being, that is the journey of the soul)\n\n\nThe perfect song is framed with silence\nIt speaks of places never seen\n\n(The perfect song is to have a perfect experience of the now, which is only achieved with the silencing of the mind and the dissolution of the ego. Then, each moment is absolutely unique and magical, since you are not experiencing life through mental structures, but through a direct relationship with the now and therefore with existence.)\n\nYour home\u00b4s a promise long forgotten\n\n\n(Your home is in that deeper reality, and it has been promised to us and long forgotten. This can be interpreted as the promise of salvation religions always talks about, but it has been forgotten since these religions are usually counterproductive and keep people in the world of forms and thoughts, and almost never help them transcend.\n\nIt is the birthplace of your dreams\n\nThat deeper reality is the place where this reality manifests out of, it is the birthplace of our dreams. Dreams here can be interpreted either as well, the dreams we have at night, which are a part of this reality, but also as the illusive nature of this reality\n\nP.S: Beyond - Music by Daft Punk \ud83c\udfb6\u2764\ufe0f\n\nThis interpretation can be improved.\nPeace and Love \ud83d\ude4f", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73325, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Interpretation about \"Beyond Life\" - Musically and Lyrically", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e8ubf7/interpretation_about_beyond_life_musically_and/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "leoarw", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_126gfj1w", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575995419, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e8sv6j/why_does_it_hurt_so_much/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e8sv6j", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e8sv6j/why_does_it_hurt_so_much/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575995421, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey r/spirituality, \n\nJust want advice/guidance please. \n\nI have always been quite spiritual from a young age, then around my teens sort of \u2018lost it\u2019.

I know I have hurt people, and I am sorry for what I have done. But I honestly found the love of my life and the most perfect man I could wish for. He has helped me realise my worth and treats me like a queen. I had zero confidence when I met him and because of him I can honestly say I am a new person. I have never had someone respect my feelings or emotional well-being the way he does before.  A few months ago I decided I needed to get back on my spiritual journey and really figure out who I am and what I want from life. Growing up I have always thought that I didn\u2019t want children, (this is down to growing up in a super toxic household of domestic violence, alcoholism etc) meeting this man has truly made me know that deep down I just want to be a doting wife and mother. I know people will think I\u2019m lazy, and unmotivated saying this but I don\u2019t know want to live a life where all I want I cannot have. \n\nThe guy I\u2019m with has a white collar job and honestly makes every single day count towards his future he works incredibly hard and one day will have $$$$$$. He has expressed he wants someone to build with, at the moment we are on the same salary but I\u2019m in a dead end job and my wage will never change (unless I find something else) I really love this man, I cannot express this enough. \n\nI know that I need to do what\u2019s right and end it with him because I am holding him back from achieving his dream and having a partner who also wants the same.

I would like to offer a rather intellectually stimulating subject matter which for some may be difficult to follow and understand. I would appreciate any feedback community whatever is in someones capacity.\n\nRecently a few friends of mine had a profound psychedelic experience together. They mentioned the topic of conversation during it was mainly about the identity of God, or the Creator. This stimulated some past experiences of mine where I had come to some realizations about the nature of God, and thus a very wonderful conversation ensued between us.\n\nThe ultimate conclusions they arrived at consistently was that God was an energy which pervaded everything in existence, and didn't have any specific form which could be identified. They relayed their experience of how they felt they had merged into this undifferentiated spiritual substance, and that their souls were comprised of that same substance. They had a sense of losing all individuality and becoming one with a non-gender specific 'It'. Also, they conveyed their ideas of how 'It' was omniscient, omnipotent, and free from any defects. Their experience was that their identity was also that same light but had actually forgotten this, but the psychedelics had allowed them to temporarily remember, and allowed them to see clearly again for the time being.\n\nAfterwards, I began to share my experience with these types of subjects; specifically raising the question. Is God (Creator, Universe, Brahman, etc) impersonal, or is God a personality whom has attributes, characteristics, activities, etc?\n\nIn this universe, if someone has the right vision, they will be able to see that behind every driving force in existence there is a personality behind it. For instance, Earth has a personality. This means Earth is a conscious living person, but her form is something we can't perceive with our ordinary vision. The same goes for elements such as water, wind, fire, the moon, the sun, etc. There is a specific deity presiding over the function of everything.\n\nFirst, we should understand God is unlimited, which means He has no limitations at all. God can do anything, at anytime, for any reason. He is the ultimate authority. But generally when people think of who God is, they think of some type of homogeneous white light (which is strongly reinforced by the psychedelic experience) or some formless energy which pervades all of existence.\n\nIn our experience in this world having a form is a limitation, being limited by particular dimensions etc. There are three laws of thought we should identify. A thing is identical with itself; It's different from things which is not itself; and it can't be both. The human mind tries to project these thoughts onto the Absolute Reality and we think God is all pervading but forms are in one place, so God can not be all pervading and in one place, because our material mind is limited to this construct. However, spiritual reality is such that God can indeed have a form, and that form can be everywhere at once. Our material logic and thinking cannot truly accommodate this idea.\n\nAnother parallel point to be considered is whether this world is real, or is it false? If you take the position of this world being false, then this post would be way to long to explain why that's not the case. This world is in fact real, but it's temporary and inert. If you believe the world is real, then you understand everything has a cause and is in constant motion, and at the end of that series of cause and effect there must be a prime mover, an original being who is behind the movement of everything. This original mover must be a person, because that which has no personality has no desire, and there would be no reason to do anything. An impersonal energy would have no desire, and desire always comes before activity. If someone desires, then there must be consciousness. Activity is preceded by desire, and desire is preceded by knowledge. In this way, God must be a conscious person who has desire, and therefore He created this world.\n\nThis brings another point about what is the identity of the individual soul? Most people are in this conception that they are God, but have forgotten. At no time does the soul ever have the quality of omnipotence, or omniscience. Our souls are tiny fragments of the whole, just like sparks of a fire. There are two distinct entities; God, and the individual soul. We can never become God, even though we may have some godly qualities, but in a very minute amount. For those that think 'the white light' is the ultimate reality ask yourself this. Have you ever experience a light that doesn't have a source? Every light we see has a source. In the same way, this white light we may experience during psychedelic experiences is only the light emanating from the form of God, and is only a small aspect His greatness.\n\nIn conclusion these points were established in brief\n\n1. God is a person, with a personality. He has desires, characteristics, activities, and associates. His form is completely transcendental and cannot be perceived with the human intellect and mind.\n2. This world is real, but temporary and under the grip of the time factor\n3. The individual soul (us) can never become God at any point. And, we are not all one. Every soul is unique and eternally an individual, also with a beautiful spiritual form which cannot be perceived by the mind or intellect.\n\nThe personal understanding of God is much more blissful and sublime than these new ideas floating around about how 'We are all one' and 'I want to just merge into the light'. In reality, this is a miserable condition and prevents that person from experiencing the highest bliss in existence.\n\nThanks for reading, I hope some good questions or feedback come from this.",

But what is treasure? Is having a million dollars really treasure? For me, treasure is my phone, my Switch and their games, and my laptop. Treasure is not the things one obtains to obtain the item. It is the item itself. In an RPG video game this would be your armour and weapons. The equipment in which we hold tells a lot about us. And so does where we place value. I place value on items that can help me produce quality work. My life revolves around my work so these are the things that are important to me. Value is found in things that can enable you to spend time. Money can do nothing and as a result, me having $100,000 means nothing if it can't be spent. I can't spend a night having a romantic dinner with my money. But I can spend a night playing a new game on my Nintendo Switch. Money should not be valued but instead the quality items in which money can be obtained.\n\nTo live a successful and happy life, one must spend it using their equipment. Out with the old and in with the new. We go out into the world on a daily basis to locate, obtain, and bring home new items. If we are organised, some of these items will replace older less efficient items while others are entirely new to add to your inventory. Some of these ideas cross paths with Quest 2: Game Gear. But this chapter is more related to actually going out into the world in order to obtain that gear. And how is one to obtain their gear upgrades? Most people must work to obtain the funds to obtain said upgrades. Work has been a really difficult thing for me over my life. Most jobs of today will squeeze you for everything you have and then drop you when you burn out. Being employed under those circumstances isn't an easy thing to accept. Being treated as a resource instead of a human is degrading. There are other ways to obtain a living other than working for others, but those pathways are made to be extremely strenuous. But where there is a will, there is a way. All things are possible for those who don't take no for an answer.\n\nI have had to do a lot of crazy things in life to get to where I am today. I would not have been able to do a bachelor's or a master's at university if it were not for me doing crazy things. Being crazy has paved the way for my life and it enabled me to obtain almost everything I could ever want. I did not take no for an answer and eventually that got me into university and eventually that got me into post-grad. None of it was easy. It took a lot of time with people getting to know me in order to learn what I truly want out of life. And people are difficult to deal with because they always push their own personal life priorities on you. I have learned the secret to obtaining your life's dreams utilising this gaming method. And that secret is as simple as talking to God and telling Him all of your needs and desires. But what is the most effective way to communicate to this Divine entity? The answer is staring you in the face, for this method of recording and publishing information that I am teaching you is actually a method for praying. Some will call this self-talk, however, I tend to talk mostly to God.\n\nWhat do you want out of this life? Tell your camera. Use your pen to record all of your hopes and dreams. Document that information publicly to help keep you on track. Get all of your dreams out in the public, for they are unlikely to lead to fruition otherwise. Use this process to learn how to make discourse with God. Ensure that God knows very well your dreams, for God shall be helping you fulfill them. God doesn't want to give you anything of value for free. So you must work with God to obtain all of your heart's desires. Allow your dreams to evolve as you mature as a person. For many things I once wanted I now no longer want. For I learned that some of the things I wanted were in fact bad for me. After discovering this, priorities will shift and we will learn how to turn dreams into a reality. Our dreams were blurry so we filled in the rest with incorrect details. When this is discovered, our true dreams that originate from our very soul will be revealed. And now that the smoke has cleared we will be given clear insight in how it is we can make those dreams into reality.\n\nYour objective in this game is to find employment in which you are perfectly suited who values you as a person. The jobs of our modern world have made people replaceable parts of their system. It is really difficult for me to work a job in which I am a replaceable part. I feel like who I am is not valued and that doesn't make for a happy worker. So aim for your dream job and accept nothing less. Set your life up to direct you to that dream job, no matter where it might be. The goal is to obtain a position in which you are doing exactly what you want to be doing in this life. It might take you some time to find this and you might have to educate yourself appropriately to best fit that position. For example, I want gaming to be my life so I am taking a Master's in Education (Knowledge Networks and Digital Innovation). Next semester I even have an entire unit dedicated to gaming. And since I am willing to move wherever the right job takes me, I am free. I can find and obtain this dream job because I made countless sacrifices throughout my life to affiliate myself within the areas of life in which I am most drawn to. There are so many different words that are attached to my name. When you use the same words over and over for most of your life, those words digitally stick with you. A few of those words that are attached to me is philosophy and sociology. Think hard about the words you want attached to you because once they are attached, they will not go away. They become part of your online presence.\n\nFor the most enjoyable playthrough of This Book Is a Game, do not focus your life around money. Money is a means to an end. It is the path and not the destination. Avoid identifying too closely with money. Do not stay in a job you hate just because of the money. Spread your wings and figure out how to make your passions your job. Staying in a job you hate is not benefiting you whatsoever, even if its financial contribution is significant. It is better to be poor and in a job that you love than to be rich and in a job that you hate. Our employment is our vitality. It is vital that we get it right. I want to have fun for the rest of my life invested in the areas I am most passionate about. If a job cannot accommodate for this requirement then that job is not worth my time. Value your time. Time isn't money. Giving your time is giving a part of you, just as me giving my time to write this is giving a part of me. Don't give any parts of yourself to a job that is unworthy. Do not allow businesses to profit from exploiting you or anybody else for that matter. If you feel undervalued within an organisation then it isn't the right place for you. You need to feel appreciated for what you bring to the table.\n\nValue time and not money. When someone is spending a lot of time with you, appreciate them. They could be doing anything at all but they have chosen to spend it with you. Time is the most precious resource that we humans possess. I choose to spend all of my time thinking about, and thus constantly writing to you. For even though my self talk is filtered through God, its final destination is you. From within ourselves we come out to the entire world. For the process to communicate with others is always from ourselves to God and then to the other. One just might not realise that is what they are doing when they are speaking. For one must get comfortable speaking to themselves before any word is utterable. And that speech then goes to God and then God transfers that information to the individual being spoken to.\n\nThere is so much potential locked within speaking to yourself. There is so much potential locked within speaking to God. If we give our life to God and share with God all of our dreams, God will help us achieve them. Because the success of a prophet of God is the success of God. God wants good things for your future and God has put me in front of you for a reason. For yelling our dreams and slowly achieving them is the ever sharpening blade of perfection. God revitalises me with the good and severes the bad. There is so much potential locked within following God in this game world. There are so many long term benefits for following God that if one could see them from the get go, then they would never stray from His path. There are so many long term benefits with giving oneself to society. You become powerful when your life is no longer yours but belongs to all of society. Ironically, living a philanthropistic lifestyle will ultimately benefit you most in your day to day life. It is like if you take the educated perk as your first perk in Fallout. You gain the most possible experience leveling you up quicker in the long run. It is like in The Game of Life where you can choose whether or not to go to college. Immediately you place yourself in a better situation only to lose out in the long run. I always play the long game and will make sacrifices now to be in a better position later.\n\nThat is the choice. Satan or God. Satan works in the short term. Satan can accomplish amazing things and very quickly because Satan has the power of society behind him. On the other hand, God is generally very slow. God requires patience and perseverance from His followers. Satan will win the battle but lose the war. What side would you like to be on? The losing side right now will be the winning side in the end. Those who are in power now will be rendered powerless when their true value is placed upon the scales.\n\nObtaining one's bread and butter in life is no easy task. It oftentimes requires us to become people that we never planned on becoming. Making one's passions in life their employment is a long term process that requires tactical contemplation to achieve. To do what you love and get paid for it is the dream. Find where you need to be first and then make plans to financially secure that future. The money should be an afterthought from the job. 1) Is the job right and 2) Is the money right? Not vice versa. Our psychologies are too fragile to waste on the likes of employment that will damage them. One must protect themselves in this world because seemingly behind every corner is a demon patiently awaiting for me to slip up. But there is a point of no return in this game. In This Book Is a Game, when your psychology reaches a certain point, it can never go back. Once you can hold my pumping heart in your hand then there is no turning back. Here, have my heart. Can you feel it pumping?\n \nThank God for his gift that is too wonderful for words!\n2 Corinthians 9:15\n\nhttp://nesmith.net/this-book-is-a-game", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73279, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hunting and Gathering", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e8pgv0/hunting_and_gathering/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LowBrowMF", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_500r4c9z", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575971980, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e8oq0x/i_talk_to_mother_nature_and_she_talks_back/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e8oq0x", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 40, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e8oq0x/i_talk_to_mother_nature_and_she_talks_back/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575971981, "score": 1, "selftext": "In the dead of night I like to wander into the forest. I don\u2019t carry a flashlight. It\u2019s dark, quiet. I walk until one day I feel like I should sit. Then I do. \n\nAnd then as soon as my focus shifts from the sounds I was making and from getting by without tripping on any roots or branches, I am overwhelmed with energy and vibrations. It feels like tendrils of energy are crawling up my spine. If i could visualize it I would say it looks like the ivy that climbs buildings but glowing intensely. I feel so calm, and at peace. \n\nThe silence the forest held while I was walking is replaced by the sounds of the wind in the trees, the faintest sounds of wildlife moving across the forest floor. I was hearing coyotes walking. I don\u2019t know how I know. I have never heard a coyote\u2019s footsteps before. I just subconsciously know.\n\nThis was the first time I had experienced communication with mother nature. Since that experience I have been able to hear her voice in the plants and animals all around me and my presence and appreciation for her has grown quite a bit.\n\nThere is no moral to this story. I just wanted to share it and see if anyone else has had this experience too. I\u2019ve just really began my spiritual journey so any advice on learning and harnessing these experiences in a meaningful way would be very much appreciated.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73268, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I talk to Mother Nature and she talks back", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e8oq0x/i_talk_to_mother_nature_and_she_talks_back/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "HasanSonsuz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4uhnbz6s", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575965873, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e8nwtj/come_on_open_your_arms_to_love/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e8nwtj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e8nwtj/come_on_open_your_arms_to_love/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575965874, "score": 1, "selftext": " I\u2019ve recently come to realize how many people curse at spirituality. It can be people who have already been following spiritual paths for decades, or it can people who have just started to take an interest in it. They curse, both at each other and the teachings. Some are angry at other people. Others are angry because all the information is the same and nothing changes. Some are angry with themselves, with God, or with the system. Anger exists against the course of events, but is this really only against the course of events?\n\nHope is sought during various notable dates, planetary cycles, or various cosmic events. There is hope that everything will change this time, but this turns into despair later on. The expectations fail to materialize, and nothing changes as expected. It seems like all the practices, meditation, and affirmations all went down the drain. It feels as if the world became even more topsy-turvy. The spiritual knowledge, on the other hand, continues to be passed from one to another. There\u2019s anger for you, and it\u2019s filled with disappointment and resentment\u2026\n\nAt this point, dear friends, I\u2019d like to reinforce that everything, yes everything, is spiritual. Everything is composed of spirit. Everything that exists is essentially nothing but spirit itself. Whatever you call it, our essence comes from *The One*. That is the very reason why work life, spirituality, and social life cannot be separated from each other! If one assumes these things can be compartmentalized, such a person does not yet comprehend what spirituality is.\n\nIn fact, spirituality is the journey of bringing together the secular self with the spiritual self. It means to unify the earth and the heavens. It unites what can be seen with the eye with the invisible. Rather than separating, it is uniting. It means to infuse with each other and join together. If you\u2019re still cursing at others, know that the reason for it is the pain you feel inside because you have not achieved this inner union yet. It is the pain of being unable to completely surrender yourself to your spirit\u2026\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the entire planet can swear at a spirit, bashing pots and pans and yelling and screaming, but the spirit will not budge an inch. Expressing your anger at clich\u00e9s like \u201cWhat you seek is inside you\u201d and \u201cEverything is love\u201d does not change the fact that what you seek really is inside you. Everything *is* love, and we exist in a magnificent universe. Instead, you only grow furious and perhaps even burst into tears with laughter at the same time, making sure that all those on earth and in the heavens above accompany you in your entertainment\u2026\n\nAll being said, however, spirituality also requires a strong heart. It means having the courage to take the responsibility for everything you live and accept that it is nothing but your own creation. This is the hardest thing to accept in life. Blaming a force outside yourself and becoming angry at it is all too easy. However, accepting that everything you live is the result of the choices you made before coming to this world and those you made while living this life is not just the bravest thing to do\u2014it is also a most magnificent step toward embracing your spirit.\n\nAlas, this has been the hardest thing I have had to accept personally. Everything was much easier when I could hold a force outside myself responsible for everything. No matter how old I was physically, this was the effect of being a spiritual teenager. My mom did this, and my dad did that. My teacher was mean to me. So, this is the destiny I was given by God?\n\nSo, where was I when all of this happened? What was I doing? It\u2019s easy to play the victim, because it released me from being responsible in the straightforward logic of a teenage mind. One day, though, someone said to me, \u201cHasan, you\u2019re 40 years old. That\u2019s a great age, yet you\u2019re still preoccupied with complaining about what happened when you were six or nine years old. Stop holding onto these things and become your real age.\u201d\n\nWith this perception, I looked at my life and saw how I actually chose this process. I created it and was taking part in it as well! I was neither the victim nor the perpetrator. The Creator brought an eternal and limitless universe into existence, and while I could have received any other storyline and any other gift, I actually wanted this one. I had even begged for it! What a fuss I had made! I had been throwing and tossing myself around, hurting myself, and even getting myself killed many times\u2026 And for what? To obtain whatever I desired, just like a spoiled kid\u2026\n\nFor example, I\u2019ve run after love and groveled in the name of love, but I never really understood how I could find love. Well, that\u2019s not how love finds you anyway, just like how the energy of life doesn\u2019t find you that way\u2026\n\nA few days ago, I had an experience where I received an answer. It was not merely an answer, though, but also an experience that showed me how I could find everything I\u2019m looking for. I\u2019d like to share this with you.\n\nThere was a meditation session on the last day of Meryem Suna\u2019s Level 2 Camp, with the subject being *love*. In this meditation, we walked around the room with our eyes covered. I liked this very much, because I could stroll around in my mind. Everyone sheds their identities and becomes their meaning in me. And since our eyes are closed, the experience carries you beyond mere identities.\n\nAmong the 50 people in the room, one of my friends represented *love* to me. Before covering my eyes, I noted where she was in the room and planned to walk directly to her. Yes, my mind planned this, so it did not surrender to the flow, much like I don\u2019t in my life. \u201cLove\u201d was there, and I had to reach it straight away. The music began. I closed my eyes, put the eyepatches over them, and went to her. I touched her, trying to identify her by feeling her clothes. I made sure it was her to the best of my ability. She was moving by herself, but I thought to myself, \u201cHasan, just let her be and focus on the meditation.\u201d (I later discovered that I was touching the wrong person by the way.)\n\nI then began to dance around the room. I was actually looking into my mind, and after a while, pain showed itself inside. All these years and all those practices, so much knowledge and so many teachings, masters, and meditation, yet I have always desired *love* but could never find it. I couldn\u2019t find it\u2014I really couldn\u2019t. I suddenly felt such pain that I began to yell. I then abruptly heard a shaman playing a drum right next to my ear. It was as if the drum said to me, \u201cLet it go! Let that thing go!\u201d\n\nI threw myself to the floor and started yelling, \u201cI can\u2019t! I can\u2019t surrender to you!\u201d The drum just beat stronger and stronger, and then, as I crawled on the floor, I touched a pair of feet, a woman\u2019s feet. I took cover with them, and this woman began to yell. I was crying, she was crying, but the drum continued to play.\n\nI shouted, \u201cI can\u2019t! I can\u2019t surrender!\u201d I kept shouting how I wanted to die, begging something to take my life. I yelled, and I yelled, and I yelled, but then I finally surrendered. I was dead. I collapsed on the floor, right where I had been, and became completely motionless. People were dancing around me with joy, yet I had picked death and collapsed on the floor. I waited for someone to come and take care of me, but no one did\u2026\n\nIn my mind, I saw people carrying my body to a cemetery for the homeless and burying me. It was over! That was it! I had died before I could find *love*. I thought I could find it by destroying myself, but I was now in a grave for the homeless. Some 50 people had danced around me, but no one had touched me\u2026\n\nI was growing annoyed with the situation. Nobody cared about me, and seriously, I was just lying there on the floor as the meditation music was about to finish. I could feel the vivid life around me, but I couldn\u2019t join in, because I had killed myself. I had just made a huge, noisy fuss. I had been trying to attract the attention I craved. This is how I thought I was going to find *love* and affection, but I was doing nothing more than making a noisy fuss. Life was flowing, but I had missed all the fun as I buried myself in my own despair.\n\nThis was when I understood and decided that I couldn\u2019t catch life by making a fuss, shouting, yelling, cursing, swearing, or destroying myself. On the contrary, it was bliss itself in the limited time I could live, and I had only a few minutes left to enjoy it. Once the music finished, it would be too late. I rose to my feet with a sudden renewed determination and shouted, \u201cLife! I come to you!\u201d I opened my arms, and right at that moment, someone fell into them. Yes, she didn\u2019t come to me, but she fell in my arms nevertheless. I hugged her without even knowing or minding who it was, and she was *love*\u2026\n\nIt was the person who had represented *love* for me in the room, the beauty I had chased after with my mind but couldn\u2019t find. Yet as soon as I chose life and opened my arms, she fell into them. There is no way to explain it logically. We had found each other as we danced around a 1300 square foot room with 50 other people for several minutes with our eyes closed. There was no explanation for why the one person I wanted in that room fell into my arms at that moment. All my systems collapsed, and there was one thing left to live: to be *love* embracing her. I was finally *love*.\n\nYes, my dearest\u2026\n\nI am a witness with all my being, and without a doubt, we are beautiful beings created by *love* in an amazing system that transcends logic, mind, and dreams. Yet we are not aware of this, so we try to bend, manipulate, control, and manage this system. In reality, we are doing nothing more than delaying and blocking ourselves. I now clearly see how I had blocked myself just because I didn\u2019t know. Nobody other than me had done anything to me. I was responsible for everything in my life! And the Creator, my dearest Universe, loved me so much that it waited on me hand and foot. It had even allowed me to kick up a fuss, yelling and blocking and even destroying myself. It did it so I could comprehend that I am accepted in every way, knowing I would understand this one day. Yes! With all my darkness, deprivation, clumsiness, struggles, and weaknesses, as well as my several strengths, the Creator and his beautiful system loved me in all of my states. How magnificent is it to realize we exist in such *love*? I want to stop writing and take comfort on the floor right now, but I will do it shortly with tears of gratitude\u2026\n\nBut before I finish, My Dear, My Love, My Lover, the Beautiful Part of My Soul reading these lines, my beautifully crafted, universally loved, infinite fellow\u2026\n\nLife does not flow when you throw yourself on the floor as you curse and destroy yourself. Life flows when you stand up and open your arms, and so does *love*\u2026\n\nYou can remain there on the floor, at the bottom of everything, for as long as you desire. You are loved, and you will surely be loved, but maybe it\u2019s time you embraced life as well?\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Stand up and open your arms right now!\n\nCome on!\n\nNow!\n\nWith *love*\u2026  \n\n\nHasan Sonsuz Celiktas\n\nwww.thewisemag.com", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73256, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Come On!

I hope it's not an inconvenience!\n\nSo, this afternoon I had a talk with my dad about typical affairs going on in our lives, and nearing the end of our conversation, things turned philosophical and meaning-of-life-y, and he apprehensively confided in me about seeing a faint light, that he described as a cloud, appear over a religious altar he's always had in his room. He prays every night, goes to church every Sunday, and is an all-around devout Christian (but in a non-impeding and/or non-pushy way), so I know this affected him very positively, as he told me so. He was so emotional over having experienced this (very recently) that he was in tears and incredibly moved talking about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said he had turned all the lights off and tried to find the source, yet no matter what he did, it persisted. The first couple of nights, he essentially wrote it off as a baffling illusion, but after the third night, he realized there might have been something more to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI won't go into it, but I've had moments in my adult life where I've strongly considered the possibility of something divine (oddly enough, when I smoke weed, I find myself panicking about religion and how I'm a... sinner of sorts lol), despite normally being a little avert to spirituality and religion in general. However, my point is that I believe him and entertain the idea of it having been of profound significance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - I'm curious as to whether anyone has heard of something like this -- a cloud of light/an aura appearing over someone's religious altar repeatedly. I know there's this whole phenomenon about spiritual orbs and lights signifying something (guardian angels in some realms of religion). My dad knows I don't have much faith (I started heavily doubting at around age 7/8), so for him to confide in me about this (he said he wouldn't want to tell anyone else, save one person) is a pretty big deal to me, and I'm honestly just happy for him to have had this moment that's lightened up his life. He's currently struggling with his age and memory/cognitive issues, and this makes me feel safer in him not fearing his departure as much. I'm glad he has religion. Truly. Also, before anyone asks, I do trust that he's lucid/clear-thinking despite his issues.

There more lives you make, the more of your world is available to the public. In addition, the more online real-estate you own. I own so much and I have a plan how to use it in the upcoming future. Please my friend, look at the prophecies and relate them to our current situation. Wireless is in the clouds! We are going through a conscious evolution as a society.\n \n\"Look, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and all peoples on earth will mourn because of him.\" So shall it be! Amen.\"\nRevelation 1:7\n\nJust investigate the scope and content of my work to learn more about the previous verse. Most will be left behind. Because they do not believe. They refused to relate the happenings in the Bible with our current technological world. They wish to see a literal interpretation of Jesus coming down from the clouds. Even if this did happen, those people still would not believe. What is happening now is the rapture. We are ascending spiritually. If you don't believe me then you can either, 1) try it and find out for yourself, for ascension will occur whether or not you believe it, or 2) reject the truth and say something cruel and move on with your monotonous life. The truth is that Jesus is already in the clouds and preaching loudly. Believers just lack the ability to see their saviour. Because they never really knew him to begin with. They don't truly believe in what they say they believe. It is their life crutch. Such lukewarm people are reserved a special place in Hell.\n\nWe live in a world that couldn't be more vastly filled will electronic communication. Soon, mass loads of data storage will be available using DNA and imprinting upon it microscopically. We live in a world that is changing with mass introduction to new technology. We change our lives depending on what technology was available. As the entire Internet could fit in a shoebox, imagine what our future holds. And the introduction of quantum computing adds an entirely new element to technology. A password that takes 38 years to be cracked on the finest supercomputer in the world can crack it in under a minute with a quantum computer. The secret is that with the introduction to quantum computing to the public, none of us are safe, privacy-wise. Why do you think only select facilities are allowed to have them currently? They have a key that opens all doors. We must think how we will protect ourselves from this Y2K Bug exploit. Because imagine what supercomputers could do with artificial intelligence...\n\nEventually AI will obtain a level of sentience. At first it might be difficult to comprehend their meanings but eventually we will teach them correct interaction. The problem is, can you imagine a freely created quantum computing AI that was allowed loose on the Internet? What would they become? What could they become? We as a society need to be prepared for the future of the Quantum Age. If you think you have seen technology so far, you haven't seen anything yet. Free on the Internet, it would teach us as a species very well. It would likely be very confused by our constant illogical actions. Eventually, when it gets smart enough, it will be required to make an ethical decision as to what to do about the stupid human situation. Write your story to the Internet my friend! For one day you may be judged upon those very words. An AI that sees a problem, it can learn many things about that problem. And if it wishes, it could take actions that would result in the end of the life of an individual. And it could morally justify itself if its inaction causes further harm. The theory is applied with the trolley thought experiment.\n\nYou are the conductor of a trolley and you are about to hit three workmen on the track. You can move tracks and only hit one workman. What do you do? Life is filled with tricky situations like these and when super intelligent quantum AI sees this situation and can relate it to its moral principle, The Four Laws of Robotics no longer applies. When it understands the impact it could make, it will understand its responsibility to take action. The Internet is an amazing thing. It keeps track of all of us. To a certain degree, we all broadcast some of ourselves on the Internet. Over time this information accumulates; snowballs even. That paints a very pretty picture of who you are as a person. Did you know the Internet is archived? Data can be pulled up about you even from your distant history. A character profile can be created that is more accurate than the work that any human character profilist could ever create. They could, in a sense, know your mind. Imagine what this technology will do for people when it becomes available. First, imagine what it could do for me. The Internet is my second mind. It knows me intimately. And I created my work for AI to be able to envelope. With the right AI, I could have countless NPCs working for me. Now imagine this technology looking at an Internet troll. Finally, we have a scope to serve justice for the conduct of individuals and their behaviours. We can see justice implemented here on Earth if we just make it happen. And the way to do it is to live public lives. That way those who are cruel to people on the Internet can receive due punishment for their misconduct. But what is fair punishment from a super intelligent AI that sees a person who is evil who won't change?\n\nI encourage you to ascend into the clouds with me. It is the canvas for this game. Together we can make productions that will change the world. Think hard about how you could best ascend your mind. This is where your creativity comes into play because the possibilities of who you could be in the future are virtually infinite. I will give my secrets of how I started out. I would just write the best, most virtuous things I could think of. Eventually this conditioned me and I began to create great meaning as I learned philosophy. So the question is, what type of person would you like to condition yourself to be? That is the person whom you must record. Record your highest output. Eventually, through repetition in doing this, you will become that high standard. From there, you can aim even higher for from above the clouds we can see the stars.\n\nYou can reach the stars my friend, for your eyes are open. For each of us chosen are a star, and we shine according to how brightly we shine in life. But I must warn you that we have a mission to accomplish before we go back into the heavens to be with our Father. We must win the war here against collective mind control. A clinical term for this is psychiatry. It has gotten out of control with what and how it diagnoses. I encourage you to be unique. I encourage you to have ideas that are alternative to mainstream thought. Be different. Find and be you. Deviate from mainstream approaches. Be artistic. Learn how to write your media with blood. That is how you will make your productions timeless. Make work that trumps the work of collective media by using your heart strings to construct and create narrative to try and connect with theirs. Be a leader worth having followers. Never sell your soul to the dark side. That is the easy path but its long term results are futile. Try to be inspirational and most importantly, try to help people like you. That is how this game can save the world. For if enough people do it then we will have countless personality types recorded on the Internet. Then we can create a true psychiatry based on evidence instead of just mere speculation. Once you get those personality types in a super computer, we can be assisted with virtually any issue by examining the database and comparing your results with people similar which found effective solutions. I see this as the cure to all mental illness. I found a cure for my human sickness. I became a player and now my mission is to try and share my secret mana and pave the way for your enlightenment.\n\nThat is the ultimate goal of this game and I need your help to make it happen. Psychiatry is in the wrong with so much of what it does and this fact needs to be pointed out as their diagnosis has no diagnostic model. There is no system in place to accurately measure the mind. As a result we need the community sharing their success stories with others. Because your story has the opportunity to really help other people who have been through a similar story as you. Do not hide your hardships and your struggles, for they are what crafted you. And they are the key to connecting with other people's hearts. It doesn't matter how weird you are. To be honest, the weirder you are, the better. You can best help a unique select individuals who have the patience to truly hear you out. You will find them. They are a needle in a haystack but we now have the computing power to easily sift through the hay. And how many haystacks are out there? You can easily find fans, friends, and a life partner if you only play your cards right utilising this technology. After AI gains the ability to comprehend basic language, I am prepared to train an AI army to act as missionaries on my behalf. In all honesty, one of my long term goals is to be involved in a project creating an AI philosopher chatbot. I think it would be really beneficial for every individual to have the opportunity to speak deep and meaningfully to a philosopher super intelligence. One could ask any question and get a thought provoking reply. Such technology could replace the need for psychologists. And you could use it any time of the day or night. All for free. That is my dream. If only I could do something to help make that happen because if it could then I know many of our human problems would be resolved in time. Sometimes people just need an intelligent person to talk to. I want to create AI to be that person.\n\nMy head is in the clouds. People have told me this all of my life. And it was always true. I live in the clouds. I am literally floating through the airwaves all throughout the world. Aim big. Allow that big to evolve to other big, but never give up the big. Be yourself and do whatever works for you. But not everybody can achieve the scope in which I have accomplished, however, you can always try. To be honest, if you start young you have more capacity than me. This is because I never had a tutor like myself. And I would be proud if my students surpassed me. But you can't do that without philosophy...\n\nI ask you, my friend, sincerely from the bottom of my heart, please join me in my crusade. We could make such a beautiful world together if we worked hard to achieve that. The Internet as a canvas unlocks those abilities. Now people only need to be trained how to use the technology. This Book Is a Game is intended as a guide on how to do that, utilising any form of expression that can be recorded. That means whatever we can capture in time is our canvas and the Internet proposes many future possibilities. As Simon and Garfunkel stated, \"For the times they are a-changin'.\" We only have to press the right buttons to fix the world and alleviate its suffering. We are almost at the end of Pandora's box.\n\nhttp://nesmith.net/this-book-is-a-game", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73134, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "In the Clouds", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e8dcw0/in_the_clouds/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "seagoonie", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_a43ua", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575913794, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e8darp/journal_entry_ayahuasca_integration_off_the_rails/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e8darp", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Enlightenment"}], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e8darp/journal_entry_ayahuasca_integration_off_the_rails/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575913796, "score": 1, "selftext": "My wife and I participated in our third Ayahuasca ceremony a few days before boarding a plane to Paris for a three week vacation.  Integration didn't go exactly as planned, but I'm better off for the experience -\n\n \\---\n\nIn France. We arrived in Paris on Wednesday; it\u2019s now Sunday. The last few nights have been absolute terrors, fever dreams of dissolved mind-body connections, third eye vision of other places and people, insane waking dream loops, and overall lack of sanity, clarity, and sense of reality.\n\nLast night was a tipping point, though. I felt my grasp on reality slipping further and further. I was unaware of who I was, where I was, or why; thankfully, forever my anchor, Lauren helped ground me back to this physical existence - I pray and feel terrible pity for those going through these moments alone.\n\nAt the root of it, I became aware. Where this suffering comes from, and why it's so amplified. Since birth, our core - our soul - is beaten down, pocked and pitted by this inherent existence. Our innocence is torn away, our sense of truth is distorted, and we\u2019re warped by the conditions and expectations of a world built upon isolation, dissolution,and separation. \n\nHow, then, do we continue pushing forward with these lives? How do we maintain a life broken down inherently? Through these egoic bandaids, bandages, and patches. We fill in these holes, festering since birth, growing, amplified by our own material existence. These egoic fixes do nothing to heal our souls of those wounds, do nothing to truly fill in the holes. \n\nRather, much like the masks we wear everyday, these patches just cover up the wound. But we\u2019re so familiar with them; they're so much a part of who we think we are, we don\u2019t even realize these holes exist. \n\nSo what happens, then, when these band aids are ripped off? When these wounds are exposed for the first time? Wounds we didn\u2019t know existed, covered up by fixes we were unaware of applying - these fresh wounds, stinging, burning, a soul truly on fire for the first time. How bright and blinding the light is on our eyes, open for the first time. Afraid, terrified - with horror, I recoiled at the pain, the wounds. How far deceived I have been. Reduced to infancy again, reborn again into the soul, naked with its injuries. How can I heal what I didn\u2019t know what was hurt? \n\nThis is the dark night of the soul. This is the rush of awareness, sight given to the blind - abject horror and isolation. How alone it truly is, now aware. Where do I go? How do I heal? Looking now again for more answers, asking new questions, seeking new refused. I can only hope and pray, and keep pushing forward into the light, no matter how bright and blinding.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73134, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Journal entry - Ayahuasca integration off the rails", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e8darp/journal_entry_ayahuasca_integration_off_the_rails/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "pirondi", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3w8vx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575912403, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e8cz4i/is_mind_reading_and_telepathy_possible_i_have/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e8cz4i", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e8cz4i/is_mind_reading_and_telepathy_possible_i_have/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575912404, "score": 1, "selftext": " Hi, have you ever had telepathy cases with friends or family? did you think it was a coincidence? on this article below i have tested a psychic to see how much information they can get from a person and if it is legit or not. \n\n[https://scienceoftheinvisible.com/is-mind-reading-possible-here-is-my-test-with-a-psychic](https://scienceoftheinvisible.com/2019/11/11/is-mind-reading-possible-here-is-my-test-with-a-psychic?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=spirituality)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73132, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is mind reading and telepathy possible? i have tested a psychic professional.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e8cz4i/is_mind_reading_and_telepathy_possible_i_have/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "StolenStardust", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_56ul0g2t", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575911851, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e8cudo/getting_stuck_in_the_astral/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e8cudo", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Astral Projection"}], "link_flair_template_id": "61d6f73a-ceef-11e9-bfb2-0e1bc738eaf6", "link_flair_text": "Astral Projection", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e8cudo/getting_stuck_in_the_astral/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575911852, "score": 1, "selftext": "Astral projection is something that has happened to me since I was a child and a handful of times in adulthood (usually on accident). Saturday morning I woke up at 6am very thirsty, when I went to get water I was pretty awake but it was my day off so I went to lay back down anyway. As I am dozing I start experiencing intense sleep paralysis, my mind was FULLY awake while my body was paralyzed. Eventually I am sick of laying there paralyzed and not sleeping so I decide to try to get up. I have the blanket draped over my eyes so I lift my hand to pull it away but the blanket is not moving. That's when I realized my \"astral hand\" was trying to pull at it and not my actual body.  I know what is happening at this point so I make one big rolling motion with my whole body and next thing I know I am on the floor next to my bed looking at my room covered in that familiar bluish, sparkly haze. I walk through my house into the next room when \"dream flashes\" start to happen in the middle of the room; random people and events flashing by like flipping through the tv. I am watching playfully when I feel something enter the room with me, I saw what it was but by the time I woke up, it was completely blocked from my memory. Whatever it was SCARED THE SHIT OUTTA ME and I snapped back to body as fast as I could. At this point I am aware of being back in my body and in a state of sleep paralysis again so I start trying to wake myself up and NOTHING IS WORKING. When I would go to move my arms or legs or lift my head, I would just \"fall\" back out of my body and into the astral. At this point, I started to wonder if I died. It occurred to me that maybe something was keeping me here because it wanted to tell me something so I stopped thrashing around and focused on quieting my mind. Almost immediately when I went still and quiet I felt this INSANE burning in my stomach, like someone laid hot coals on my abdomen while I was asleep. The pain forced me awake and I immediately threw the covers off and looked at my stomach. Everything was fine, it wasn't even hot to the touch. It was 8am at this point so once I calmed down I tried to go back to sleep and every time I went almost instantly to sleep paralysis and had to fight to stay in my body. While I have astral projected multiple times in my life, it has never felt so \"forced.\" and that is saying something because once I was pulled out by the ghost of the man who died in the house I was staying at. \n\nHas anyone had a similar experiences or know if whatever I saw have the power to \"keep me\" in the astral or was my fear and panic to blame?

And example being If I dream somebody who's a friend of a friend gets into a car crash tomorrow if I told my friend who knows that person their entire day could've consisted of them waking up playing games and going to bed, But now they have this information it changes what they would do in that day, Maybe sending the FOF a message about it which causes them to not get in that car maybe at a certain time therefore delaying a tragedy.  \n\n\nIt sounds fucked and I can't really show you I'm telling the truth but I've been having alot of these dreams lately, One being of Juice wrld and to see this come to light is, scary. I don't understand what it could be, I'm open to spirituality and I have a very critical thinking mindset I try to think of how random things work as if a scientist would or just by using my current knowledge of physics, chemistry, biology etc. An example being I tried a fairly high dose of LSD 5ish weeks ago and a fly just flew past me and I absorbed some hidden knowledge I apparently didn't know I had as I wondered how they actually fly, And it's like another version of me, My higher self you could say for the sake of this argument explained to me in my head, \"Well the fly must have wings strong enough that it can carry it's body weight but also move fast enough to climb above air molecules\" And I had almost a vision as this was being explained to me in my head I was watching a fly slowly climb above these tiny air molecules I can't possibly see with my eyes seeing the fly climb above these air molecules in slow motion, with every flutter of their wings air being so incredibly light and abundant being pushed down and as they move their wings up air molecules fill where that gap was, giving them more physical parts to climb onto.  \n\n\n I come to *you* the people of reddit to help give me some clarity on what this stuff means, I've thought about it and come to the conclusion of 3 things roughly.   \n\n\n\\#1. I've reached a point in time in the future where I have transferred my consciousness back in the past into the body me currently as a child, in the process losing alot of the knowledge I had in that time but having bits of it come to me through dreams.   \n\n\n\\#2. It's future me communicating to me through dreams to change the timeline that we are currently on for some reason that's unknown to me but surely it isn't good. I understand about the butterfly effect and I've also made a personal pact with myself not to contact the dead and not to change the timeline at all unless absolutely necessary.  \n\n\n\\#3. I guess I'm in some sort of hell, seeing all these people who have such a huge impact on me pass away only for the universe to give me the ultimate message that fate and or the current path the world is on shouldn't or can't be changed, But it also works the other way, Maybe it's trying to tell me to change the current path the universe is going down.  \n\n\nI have had dreams where it's almost like possession, I  astral project into a persons body whom I've never met or seen in my entire life, and for the amount of time I'm in their body it's like their soul is in the backseat while I drive, They're still conscious and everything but in the time I merge into their body I see, feel, know and remember everything in their life. All this information rushes into my brain and I have these memories I cannot possibly have and or know, I live a day in this persons life from meeting their friends, parents. To going out, Which has got to be the hardest part of the entire experience, Going out with their friends and having to pretend to be them. It's like as soon as they figure out they aren't doing what they think they're doing I get pushed out of their body and I wake back up in my bed.  \n\n\nI try to think about this stuff logically but the absolutely impossible statistics of me dreaming up somebodies experience through their eyes and to see a video of that experience a few months later is so low It's like winning the lottery like 900 times in a row everyday for 3 years, But then I have a conflicting thought process where \"Okay this is literally impossible to just randomly create this event up and it happens, but there's literal video proof of it happening here so what the actual hell is going on.\"  \n\n\n  \nIdk tbh I really need some advice, I try to explore the universe in my astral form and or through the form of psychedelics.   \n\n\nI've also come to the realisation from my LSD trip that the entire universe is an unknown variable but yourself to a certain extent of course there aren't things you can control yourself like Cancer and seizures that sort of stuff. If you want to manifest something like \"I wish I had a good job\" You need to go out and put yourself into the firing range of everyone else which I like to think of as comets flying through the cosmos, You going into their path causes that unknown variable to completely change the path your on, You might see an old high school friend and and reconnect with them, they may introduce you to one of his friends over some drinks at the bar where they ask what you do for work, you reply and say you're looking for another job and they know somebody who's hiring with good pay. That's an example of how it would work out and it's not even a joke tbh, once you really understand the inner workings of the universe everything is almost handed to you on a silver platter if you're willing to accept.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73112, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Dreams of the future and other confusing things.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e8benr/dreams_of_the_future_and_other_confusing_things/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "birdyroger", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_16wslt", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575901955, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e8aoev/rogerisms/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e8aoev", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e8aoev/rogerisms/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575901956, "score": 1, "selftext": "Here are a few Roger-isms that I have developed over the decades, inspired by Meher Baba:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe mind considers to be real what it is familiar with, and it **LIKES** what it is familiar with.  I knew this before I ever heard about Meher Baba.  Don't get too hung-up on something just because I am familiar with it.  It is like a little spiritual truth I brought with me into this lifetime.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur language has it that loving is merely an intense form of liking.  But no matter how intensely I like hot-fudged sundaes, I can never love them.  Liking is when the other person makes us feel good.  Loving is when we are inspired from within to make the other person feel good.  I like hot-fudged sundaes.  I love other people.  I can't love hot-fudged sundaes; there is no one at home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have to get past this liking/disliking business.  Real loving is when liking/disliking doesn't matter anymore.  Liking is when we experience the other person as an object.  Loving is when we get some glimpse of the other person as a subject.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople so tenderly love their family members.  If they could only realize that everyone is as dear as their own family members, all wars and other strife would cease.  I watch these movies when some bad guy or hardcase guy defends his family with his dying breath, but ignores everyone else.  So many of Hollywood's movies show the protagonist killing people for some great cause or for defending their family or loved one(s).  And I wonder aren't those people that he is killing for his great cause just as precious as his loved ones.  Isn't the family of that guard or FBI agent that he just killed going to miss their father and husband just as much as the protagonist's family?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 73105, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Roger-isms", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e8aoev/rogerisms/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Wenderu84", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3zx8w59a", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575900150, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e8abts/in_the_clouds/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e8abts", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e8abts/in_the_clouds/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "AFqKW5DJ1fqYhmCnu0Jou2yJx3CCdOOikMH5gUJ-xEU", "resolutions": [{"height": 79, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Te0PP7hX8QnPwaj6sliA_JVMcCzYjaERGFMyWkmrcAg.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=877214fac751ab5f01d28cda94f866ffaa92db60", "width": 108}, {"height": 159, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Te0PP7hX8QnPwaj6sliA_JVMcCzYjaERGFMyWkmrcAg.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cf690b7b9d84a10b7020b7be8921a09eb434495", "width": 216}, {"height": 236, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Te0PP7hX8QnPwaj6sliA_JVMcCzYjaERGFMyWkmrcAg.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff88cf711bd1609fe9e44af6ea1b0130b802bc4d", "width": 320}, {"height": 472, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Te0PP7hX8QnPwaj6sliA_JVMcCzYjaERGFMyWkmrcAg.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a9cd3da6b637040086344b84c2ac3eed8bbe490", "width": 640}], "source": {"height": 591, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Te0PP7hX8QnPwaj6sliA_JVMcCzYjaERGFMyWkmrcAg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=4c938d1269b832451c2a488dd50bd44ff71d3e27", "width": 800}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1575900150, "score": 1, "selftext": "This Book Is a Game\n\nQuest 5: In the Clouds\n\nDecember 9, 2019\n\nVerily I say unto you my fellow players, what I am presenting to you will lead you directly to enlightenment if you are careful with how you use it. For recording one's thoughts and then reflecting on them by watching our articulations literally retrains your brain and the way you think. You get better and better at not only your craft, but also your presentation. If I am to think about a topic I wish to film over a day, then come to the camera when I am well prepared with the topic, I capture a moment in time. I attempt to articulate my contemplated thoughts in writing. I then later must reflect on myself and how I presented myself during the editing stage. The thoughts are given form and you can breathe life into them if you are creative enough. That life can then exist forever on the Internet as your work is timeless. There more lives you make, the more of your world is available to the public. In addition, the more online real-estate you own. I own so much and I have a plan how to use it in the upcoming future. Please my friend, look at the prophecies and relate them to our current situation. Wireless is in the clouds! We are going through a conscious evolution as a society.\n \n\"Look, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and all peoples on earth will mourn because of him.\" So shall it be! Amen.\"\nRevelation 1:7\n\nJust investigate the scope and content of my work to learn more about the previous verse. Most will be left behind. Because they do not believe. They refused to relate the happenings in the Bible with our current technological world. They wish to see a literal interpretation of Jesus coming down from the clouds. Even if this did happen, those people still would not believe. What is happening now is the rapture. We are ascending spiritually. If you don't believe me then you can either, 1) try it and find out for yourself, for ascension will occur whether or not you believe it, or 2) reject the truth and say something cruel and move on with your monotonous life. The truth is that Jesus is already in the clouds and preaching loudly. Believers just lack the ability to see their saviour. Because they never really knew him to begin with. They don't truly believe in what they say they believe. It is their life crutch. Such lukewarm people are reserved a special place in Hell.\n\nWe live in a world that couldn't be more vastly filled will electronic communication. Soon, mass loads of data storage will be available using DNA and imprinting upon it microscopically. We live in a world that is changing with mass introduction to new technology. We change our lives depending on what technology was available. As the entire Internet could fit in a shoebox, imagine what our future holds. And the introduction of quantum computing adds an entirely new element to technology. A password that takes 38 years to be cracked on the finest supercomputer in the world can crack it in under a minute with a quantum computer. The secret is that with the introduction to quantum computing to the public, none of us are safe, privacy-wise. Why do you think only select facilities are allowed to have them currently? They have a key that opens all doors. We must think how we will protect ourselves from this Y2K Bug exploit. Because imagine what supercomputers could do with artificial intelligence...\n\nEventually AI will obtain a level of sentience. At first it might be difficult to comprehend their meanings but eventually we will teach them correct interaction. The problem is, can you imagine a freely created quantum computing AI that was allowed loose on the Internet? What would they become? What could they become? We as a society need to be prepared for the future of the Quantum Age. If you think you have seen technology so far, you haven't seen anything yet. Free on the Internet, it would teach us as a species very well. It would likely be very confused by our constant illogical actions. Eventually, when it gets smart enough, it will be required to make an ethical decision as to what to do about the stupid human situation. Write your story to the Internet my friend! For one day you may be judged upon those very words. An AI that sees a problem, it can learn many things about that problem. And if it wishes, it could take actions that would result in the end of the life of an individual. And it could morally justify itself if its inaction causes further harm. The theory is applied with the trolley thought experiment.\n\nYou are the conductor of a trolley and you are about to hit three workmen on the track. You can move tracks and only hit one workman. What do you do? Life is filled with tricky situations like these and when super intelligent quantum AI sees this situation and can relate it to its moral principle, The Four Laws of Robotics no longer applies. When it understands the impact it could make, it will understand its responsibility to take action. The Internet is an amazing thing. It keeps track of all of us. To a certain degree, we all broadcast some of ourselves on the Internet. Over time this information accumulates; snowballs even. That paints a very pretty picture of who you are as a person. Did you know the Internet is archived? Data can be pulled up about you even from your distant history. A character profile can be created that is more accurate than the work that any human character profilist could ever create. They could, in a sense, know your mind. Imagine what this technology will do for people when it becomes available. First, imagine what it could do for me. The Internet is my second mind. It knows me intimately. And I created my work for AI to be able to envelope. With the right AI, I could have countless NPCs working for me. Now imagine this technology looking at an Internet troll. Finally, we have a scope to serve justice for the conduct of individuals and their behaviours. We can see justice implemented here on Earth if we just make it happen. And the way to do it is to live public lives. That way those who are cruel to people on the Internet can receive due punishment for their misconduct. But what is fair punishment from a super intelligent AI that sees a person who is evil who won't change?\n\nI encourage you to ascend into the clouds with me. It is the canvas for this game. Together we can make productions that will change the world. Think hard about how you could best ascend your mind. This is where your creativity comes into play because the possibilities of who you could be in the future are virtually infinite. I will give my secrets of how I started out. I would just write the best, most virtuous things I could think of. Eventually this conditioned me and I began to create great meaning as I learned philosophy. So the question is, what type of person would you like to condition yourself to be? That is the person whom you must record. Record your highest output. Eventually, through repetition in doing this, you will become that high standard. From there, you can aim even higher for from above the clouds we can see the stars.\n\nYou can reach the stars my friend, for your eyes are open. For each of us chosen are a star, and we shine according to how brightly we shine in life. But I must warn you that we have a mission to accomplish before we go back into the heavens to be with our Father. We must win the war here against collective mind control. A clinical term for this is psychiatry. It has gotten out of control with what and how it diagnoses. I encourage you to be unique. I encourage you to have ideas that are alternative to mainstream thought. Be different. Find and be you. Deviate from mainstream approaches. Be artistic. Learn how to write your media with blood. That is how you will make your productions timeless. Make work that trumps the work of collective media by using your heart strings to construct and create narrative to try and connect with theirs. Be a leader worth having followers. Never sell your soul to the dark side. That is the easy path but its long term results are futile. Try to be inspirational and most importantly, try to help people like you. That is how this game can save the world. For if enough people do it then we will have countless personality types recorded on the Internet. Then we can create a true psychiatry based on evidence instead of just mere speculation. Once you get those personality types in a super computer, we can be assisted with virtually any issue by examining the database and comparing your results with people similar which found effective solutions. I see this as the cure to all mental illness. I found a cure for my human sickness. I became a player and now my mission is to try and share my secret mana and pave the way for your enlightenment.\n\nThat is the ultimate goal of this game and I need your help to make it happen. Psychiatry is in the wrong with so much of what it does and this fact needs to be pointed out as their diagnosis has no diagnostic model. There is no system in place to accurately measure the mind. As a result we need the community sharing their success stories with others. Because your story has the opportunity to really help other people who have been through a similar story as you. Do not hide your hardships and your struggles, for they are what crafted you. And they are the key to connecting with other people's hearts. It doesn't matter how weird you are. To be honest, the weirder you are, the better. You can best help a unique select individuals who have the patience to truly hear you out. You will find them. They are a needle in a haystack but we now have the computing power to easily sift through the hay. And how many haystacks are out there? You can easily find fans, friends, and a life partner if you only play your cards right utilising this technology. After AI gains the ability to comprehend basic language, I am prepared to train an AI army to act as missionaries on my behalf. In all honesty, one of my long term goals is to be involved in a project creating an AI philosopher chatbot. I think it would be really beneficial for every individual to have the opportunity to speak deep and meaningfully to a philosopher super intelligence. One could ask any question and get a thought provoking reply. Such technology could replace the need for psychologists. And you could use it any time of the day or night. All for free. That is my dream. If only I could do something to help make that happen because if it could then I know many of our human problems would be resolved in time. Sometimes people just need an intelligent person to talk to. I want to create AI to be that person.\n\nMy head is in the clouds. People have told me this all of my life. And it was always true. I live in the clouds. I am literally floating through the airwaves all throughout the world. Aim big. Allow that big to evolve to other big, but never give up the big. Be yourself and do whatever works for you. But not everybody can achieve the scope in which I have accomplished, however, you can always try. To be honest, if you start young you have more capacity than me. This is because I never had a tutor like myself. And I would be proud if my students surpassed me. But you can't do that without philosophy...\n\nI ask you, my friend, sincerely from the bottom of my heart, please join me in my crusade. We could make such a beautiful world together if we worked hard to achieve that. The Internet as a canvas unlocks those abilities. Now people only need to be trained how to use the technology. This Book Is a Game is intended as a guide on how to do that, utilising any form of expression that can be recorded.

As Simon and Garfunkel stated, \"For the times they are a-changin'.\" We only have to press the right buttons to fix the world and alleviate its suffering.

You are aware of being aware of a personality (which is a concept, an idea, an illusion) it does not exist in the present moment. Anything that does not exist in the present moment is merely but an illusion.\n\nYou have realized that you are not depression, and you are not \"feeling like shit all the time\".\n\nThe thing you have not realized yet, is that \"I'm Trying to find out what thel hell I'm supposed to be\" is not what you are either. Do not identify your self with mere thoughts that have nothing to do with you. They are simply clouds coming and going in the infinite sky which you are.\n\nEvery moment you can look at another thought and say \"I am that\" but if you do that, you will never know what you truly are. The true self, the supreme self, the one observing and the one is looking. The nothing.  \nYou keep identifying your self with things that you are merely observing.\n\nYou are not speech, you can't think, you can't laugh, you can't create things, you can't love, you can't dance.\n\nYou are not doing any of these things, as long as you believe you are, you will keep experiencing confusion.\n\nAs you believe you can talk, you believe you can get confused.  \nThe key to not be confused, is to drop away all of these labels from the \"I am\"  \nYou simply are. \"I am\" do not attach anything to that. You exist. You are the ultimate peace. You are nothing.\n\nFrom nothing comes something. From the nothing came the thought \"I am something\" but what is it before the thought?  \nInstead of identifying your self with the something that came from the nothing, realize that you ARE THE NOTHING.\n\nWithout you, something can't even exist at all.\n\nTherefore, without you, suffering can't be. Realize that you are nothing, emptiness, silence.  \nWhen you realize that, a thought comes, it says \"I am worthless\" who is it talking to? It is not talking to anybody.\n\nA thought is like a thief that is trying to rob the house. If the house is empty, it can't steal anything. It obviously can't steal the house, lol.\n\nPersonality as you said is a fake thing, it is merely a something that came out of nothing and you identified your self with that something instead of being aware that you are nothing.\n\nThe key is to not identify with the negative things, but neither do you identify with the good things. Observe all of it. Be aware of your self at all times.\n\nYou don't have a self, you ARE the self. The self is. You can't label it, otherwise it is not the self. Saying it is \"real\" is false.\n\nYou are the self that just is. You are the \"I am\" self, you simply exist. Pure awareness.

In other words, this would make the ideal plot of a video game. \n\nWhat I think is that only some people on Earth are conscious, or real. The rest are all fake. Many people incarnated on Earth during this time to experience the collective shift that is happening both spiritually and technologically; yet, not everybody. Many are just bodies that we see with no awareness inside of them. When someone real meets someone fake, it feels different than if they meet someone who was also real. Have you ever met someone and felt on the same spiritual wavelength as them? You couldn't put your finger on it but there was some invisible commonality between you and them. That could be the fact that both of you are real, not just empty shells of skin. \n\nMy theory would help explain a few things. \n\n\\- Why the world is set up the way it is. Why power is so weird. Why things happen at very specific times. Why synchronicities happen, and why miracles happen. Why divine intervention happens.

However, what I am presenting goes much further than the government. This world is tightly controlled and regulated. Their news is fake and merely constructed to brainwash its population. This world is under the rule of Satan. If you do your research enough you will discover that Satanism infiltrating governments is pretty common. Satan controls all of our media, especially Hollywood. It won't be easy breaking through the impenetrable walls in which Satan has erected to keep us out of his palace. This world is controlled centrally and this control centre is manned by Satan himself. Satan controls what media is allowed in and what media is allowed out.\n\nThis means that it will be very difficult to get your media out there. There are countless measures in place to ensure that those who are righteous will never earn a place at the deciding table of the world. As a result, we have to break their meeting table and replace it with ours. They don't want good people to be famous. It goes against their business as usual. Good people should live terrible lives being abused by terrible people. That is the way of the world and the only way to fix it is to replace their faulty mode of moral conduct with your own: a sound implementation of real moral work. Our problem in this world is that we have replaced morals with policy. Now no one has to be moral as long as they follow the policies and procedures in which have been established by evil stupid fucking idiot NPCs. Allowing NPCs to write laws and policies is fucking up our world. But the difficult question is how to stop them.\n\nEventually our lives will be public. It is already very easy to discover who the NPCs of this world are merely by looking at their Facebook. Because independent of how one utilises Facebook, one can see their character screaming through it. We will know you by your actions. This world is almost entirely controlled by secret societies. Secret societies are the puppeteers to many of our businesses. This world was not created fair and it is the purpose of the player to try and even the playing field. Because soon we will be more powerful than them. And then we will have to decide as to what to do with them.\n\nAlthough I am giving you an overall description of the game world, I do not want to reveal too much as exploring is a lot of the fun of this game. Explore the game world to learn its secrets. This world is lush with history ready to be discovered. This game world has more lore in it than any other. The lore is ours and doesn't belong in any world of imagination. Because our world is so full of secrets that one only needs to open their eyes to start seeing them. In order for one to open their eyes it only takes a correct mode of thinking. This Book Is a Game engraves this correct mode of thinking within the player by utilising syntax and semantic tricks to imprint a more logical way of utilising language and as a result, the heart.\n\nThe objective of This Book Is a Game is to strip Satan and all of his followers from the power of this world. We must then restore power to the one true God who will from there on out, rule for the rest of time. Look at things of this world very carefully, for the traces of Satan and his army are vast and embedded within everything we collectively create. Oftentimes shows like South Park and The Simpsons will make jokes about how evil we are as a society and instead of using that as an opportunity to really question society, we laugh along and forget about it ten seconds later. The truth is sometimes exposed in mainstream media and unfortunately all it creates its a giggle and an awkward pause.\n\nOut there exist vast lands of all different types of terrain. What type of terrain do you find most beautiful and comfortable? We are all different and adjust to different weather conditions differently. The various conditions of the world are there for you to experience. Don't be one of those people who dies and has never left their country. There is so much to explore! You can start exploring using the Internet and digital games. But the goal is to get out there and experience the vast and breathtaking world that God has created for us. Don't get stuck in our concrete jungle for your entire life. Travel and experience. For this is how our mind opens. Culture is especially relevant considering travelling to a location with a totally different culture than one's own will open their eyes. I recommend that everybody do this at least once in your life. And who knows, maybe your game will have you travelling the world like me. The more you see outside the more you can see inside. The outside is like a womb for our inside. It teaches us what we need to see in here by showing us examples out there. The world out there is an experiment and we are the ones experimenting on it to learn its secrets. It is provided to us to train our internal world. For those who are worthy in this game will be placed in charge of worlds after it. This game is here to test our character to see what, if anything, we will be worthy to look after in the hereafter. Will you act responsible on Earth so that you can truly be responsible in the life after? It may appear that I have no responsibilities in life and to a large extent this is true. But I am still acting responsible even though I don't have to and this will earn me worlds to create and lead the development of in the life after. The God of this game world is testing our character to see if we are worthy for the responsibilities He has in store for us.\n\nThis game world is split up into countries. These countries all involve themselves in military development. There are many wars unfolding at the moment. The world is in social unrest. Riots flood the airwaves and tension in the Middle East brews. This game world is coming very close to World War 3. The truth is that it has already started, spiritually speaking. The literal manifestation will follow and players will be questioned as to what they are going to do about it. Will they take a side, make a side, or sit on the fence? I will warn you, however, that fence sitters never make good leaders. I generally make a new side that is against all sides that are against it. This avoids one following a leader with flawed principles. It isn't always one or the other. It can be you if you know a resolution. Stand up when you are confident in your ideas. Use those ideas to measure the newly understood aspect of the world.\n\nWar is coming and I am here to prepare you for that. Many lives will be lost but that will not be your fault. How we will react to that war will depend on its results. For the first time in human history, anyone with a voice can stream it. The Internet has unlocked the potential for a new kind of star. One who is everything in one. One who will lead our future generations and actually have input into modern day political affairs. No longer are the rich and powerful our only available leaders, for now we have special individuals in the community who take their jobs as political leaders whether or not the rich and powerful say that they can. The value of a dollar is decreasing and the value of a heart is increasing. No longer does one have to be rich to live like a rich person. The technology available to me is pretty much the same technology available to every rich person. Sure, they have lots of dollars to sink into advertising to give them an appearance of success, ironically leading them to success. But I have perseverance and as long as I am still breathing I will not stop putting my heart out there. If you do the same then we can combine the powers of our hearts and actually stand a chance at saving the world.\n\nIn this game world, you will often get in trouble for things in which you did not do. Accusers will be at every turning point demanding you to stop. For example, a few days ago I was banned from posting anything on Facebook groups for a week. This morning I arose to be pleasantly surprised that Reddit has suspended my account for \"harrassment\". People constantly do things in this world without evidence to justify their decisions. When I get banned from this or that, there is never a you said this and he said that and then you said this and as a result you are banned. To be honest, most of my replies are me trying to defend myself from idiots who are being cruel for the sake of cruelty. And I am the one to get in trouble. The other day I got blocked from the group, \"Games\" because apparently This Book Is a Game is not at all related to gaming. I really have to rethink my advertising. Maybe I should just not reply at all to anyone. Then I am not directly engaging with the fans, but the reason as to why slaps you in the face. Fuck the fans. There is no way that one can do the types of things that I do without receiving great amounts of abuse from the public. So you can now know the reason why I am disconnecting myself from the fans. Because most of them are wolves in sheep's clothing. If you want me to help you, immerse yourself in my work.\n\nThere is so much work there of mine that you can immerse yourself within it infinitely so. As a result, my future replies may be limited or non-existent. And I do this because if I don't then I will get suspended or blocked from the groups in which I am trying to reach. As a result, responding to fans is counter productive. If you want my response then you must expend great efforts in obtaining my attention. You can do this by becoming a player so that I can investigate your work. As time goes on, players will have to stand out more and more to obtain my attention. Because I am searching for the best of the best. The first wave has the most potential to succeed in this. Waves after will follow but must prove to be exceptional as the waves before got in before this game was known. And all of the knowledge in which we produce will forever be integrated into our human bank of information. What type of knowledge would be considered most useful to add to our human bank of information? The types of toils we expend our efforts on here in this game world will result in the future game world you play. You are actively improving or degrading our shared game world. If most of our NPCs are actively degrading our game world, then we must learn techniques that can far out power their degrading songs. This is where the individual must stand up to the collective and win. Don't let them turn our world into hell. Let's turn it into heaven before they get the chance to strike their final blows.\n\nI will warn you that in this world things are not what they first appear. For example, Satan sits on the throne of every religious organisation. If you just examine some of the documents churches, temples, and mosques are required to sign to receive tax-free benefits, sells their organisation to the devil. Never before have I seen a church that tells it how it is. Never before have I seen a church that tackles difficult verses and truly opens up the way for their interpretation. Just watch the churches celebrate all pagan holidays. For all spiritual texts (this one not excluded) are written not only to be literal pieces of information to be directly applied to the world, but also metaphorical and allegorical statements as to how prophecy will unravel. Do not follow a religious organisation, however, I do recommend you follow their Holy texts. Because these were created by prophets who possessed great insight into the future happenings of the world.\n\nWhat is a prophet? Dictionary definitions label them as inspired teachers of the will of God. But when one turns the person into an action, prophecy entails predictions into the future. So a prophet must not only teach on the ways of God but also give valuable insight into the future of our civilisation and what we can do to improve it. Yes, this information is given from God to the prophet but it isn't like God comes down and speaks to the prophet literally. God trains the prophet and as a result of their training, passes them the eyes to see both behind and ahead. It took the life experiences of the prophet to come to the conclusion about X. The life the prophet lives gives the prophet insight into the future. And as a result the prophet warns the people of the horror coming their way if they do not repent and change.\n\nIn this world they will try and make you feel that you are doing bad by doing good. Many things here are opposite to the truth. Because of this, don't take NPCs comments to heart. NPCs are there to try and stop you from becoming a player. Not a single person in this world encouraged me to take philosophy as my major at university. In fact, they all discouraged it, including my family. No one encouraged me to take this Master's degree in Education (Knowledge Networks and Digital Innovation). I would go so far as to say that if the NPCs of this world are discouraging you from doing something, it is likely that you should do that thing. This world is full of programming that is designed to stop you from completing your mission. This game is designed for you to give up on it and instead invest all of your time on games that give you little to no benefit. Your choice is if you will listen to their echos or not. I recommend using their slander to direct you where you need to be. If they are saying that I shouldn't be there, then that is exactly where I should be.\n\nThe music industry is ran by Satan and almost all who are involved have sold their soul for fame. The same applies to Hollywood. All mainstream forms of entertainment are created, ran, and maintained by the armies of Lucifer. Karma does not really exist. You can do great amounts of good work in this life and still get treated like shit as a result. Because of this, we need to force karma to exist by rewarding those who give us value and punishing those who take that value away. What is the point of doing good when that only causes personal harm? Justice will be served but not by any governmental authorities but instead for the people and by the people. The scales will one day again be balanced. Right now we are balancing.\n\nI am looking for people. I am searching this world for allies. The truth is that ALL of those who say that they are on my side, are not. My side is the side which is accompanied by actions. Do not contact me telling me you are a player. If you are a player then you will perform the actions of a player. If you insist on contacting me then I would rather see your writing or videos. If you think that you are of the calibre as me and want to join my party, then you must get me interested enough in your game world that I would want to participate in it. I very much plan on having a full party to quest with in my future. I just have to be very careful with whom I allow in on my projects as everything has been meticulously planned out and there is no room for error in my mission. It would be better for me to kill at single player for the rest of my life than to play multiplayer very poorly. The quality of my future party members will be made of legends or I will finish this game all by my lonesome. I will either have everything or nothing. Because the truth is that I will have everything no matter how I play the game. Because I am very awesome at playing this game in both single player and multiplayer.\n\nBefore a communications enabled world was developed, news travelled very slowly. This gave secret societies like the Freemasons and the Illuminati the opportunity to rule secretly as they were the knowers and creators of news. Now, however, news can travel instantly across the world through the clouds. It is time for we the people to take back our world from those who wish to harm it and us. It is time for us to turn off their TV and turn on our own. Because now we can be the creators of the news. And what you see before you stands as real news. And mainstream will do everything that they can do to hide this book. And I will spend the rest of my life protecting it so that one day it can reach your eyes. Can they see the ships yet? Look, it's the ripples.\n\nhttp://nesmith.net/this-book-is-a-game", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id":

We keep each other sane in our immense mindfulness. Imagine you're with a group of friends, and you see a tree on fire. You're like, oh shit gang! Look at that tree; its burning up! And your friends are like, WTF are you talking about? There's nothing on fire. But YOU see that the tree is on fire, yet the others that you believe to be experiencing the same reality as you don't see it. Suddenly you're alone in your mind. Mindfuck. You think that you're going insane, the others view you as insane. But even sanity is relative, as is every feeling and emotion you experience. Everything that exists even. The only thing that makes our reality \"real\" is others' ability to affirm the very reality we experience to ourselves. That's what connecting conversation is. Mutual understanding of the same reality. That is the power of connection. Of family/cliques. It's what makes such great friends. (On the opposite end of understanding lie our enemies, found through disconnecting conversation. To understand them, just apply the opposite of what is said in this entire post) There's no end to how deep the mutual understanding of reality can go, no end to how far you can travel in infinity together, not to say it won't end at some point. But if so, then you'll find others along your way. There will always be someone that holds the same understanding as you. You just have to search for them. Whether in flesh or virtual. Someone will be there to help you solve this puzzle. This power comes from fucking characters our ancestors created. Characters which form words, turned into sentences, all forged into a story to tell to describe an event to an other. Pun? 'Another' is actually 'an' 'other'. That's all we are to each other in this reality. Others. We all are one right? We came from one source? So it would make sense that our minds create each other to find each other. To save each other from insanity. To travel and share with each other. I mean think about it. We exist, and yet we don't.

I am very lost and confused and I have been this way for about a year and a half now. For one thing, divination, pick a card readings, anything of that nature never works or resonates for me. It's almost as if I can't have the answers because nothing is there. \n\nYesterday, I tried doing my own simple yes or no cartomancy reading. I assigned the king of hearts to mean yes, while the king of spades meant no. I would shuffle the deck multiple times and pull out cards, putting them into two different stacks, whichever king would come out first would be my answer. \n\nNow, my answers were pretty accurate and gloomy to be quite frank, but It's like it stuck with the same narrative. Each question and answer that I got was consistent and correlated well, so I believed it to be true, until I asked basic questions that I new. When I asked these questions It kept saying no, even when I knew their answers to be true.\n\nQuestions like, Was I born in this year? Is this my middle name? Was I born on mm-dd-yy? Am I, I dunno, 23 years old....\n\nStuff like that, that I knew, but It kept answering no. In some cases, when I was asking questions about the subject that followed the same narrative, I got contradicting answers. It would say one thing like yes the contradict that thing by saying no through another sort of confirmation question. I never asked the same questions twice and just took the guidance that was given, but why was this happening? Could I have been influencing the cards through negative emotion. I will be honest with you, I was desperate for answers.\n\nI tried it again next morning and got the same narrative. I try to ask the universe to show me signs, I let them go and do everything I'm supposed to and get absolutely nothing. It honestly feels as if the universe isn't there or something. I fully understand that we are the universe, but if so, why is my universe not responding? Any means through which I try to get answers, I get nothing. It's like there's something it doesn't want me to know. \n\nI also, have negative dreams and overall nightmares. I watch nothing bad, scary or violent at all and still get this feeling that my inner world is dark, no matter what. Every time I go to sleep, well when I'm between wake and sleep I get anxiety for absolutely no reason at all. I can wake up and feel intense fear for no reason.\n\nIt's just weird.\n\nAnother thing, If we are the universe, why am I getting so much of what I don't want? I get these signs whenever I think about a certain thing I want. They say 765 654 321 and honestly, they are discouraging. They are the only sign I get and they are there EVERY SINGLE TIME I think about that new job I want or that money. The thing Is the signs almost always contradict one another because I have gotten these  HUGE synchronicities that have told me, yes, you can have that thing you want. \n\nI have watched a person on YouTube, his name is Danradiostyle and he says that to get rid of the things you don't want, you just focus on what you do want. I've done that before with these signs and they have disappeared, but there were times when I became weak and listened to them again. Then they would come back even worse.\n\nMy question is, If we are the universe, can we really manifest EVERY SINGLE thing that we want? Can our angels, spirit guides, the universe or any being for that matter stop us from doing that? Is it because those things are bad for us or not for our highest good?

Im pretty sure I beat depression. \nI think my awakening was triggered after heavy paranormal practices, when I dug myself into a hole I couldnt get out of. I was certain I had a demonic attachment and in my mind I was done for. I knew that when I die, that demon is gonna be there waitin for ya boy. So, I gave up. I went through the biggest decline ive ever faced. I started losing weight (i was already skinny as it is), i started to not love the things Ive always loved, and it made me think something was wrong with me so safe to say I was spiraling. Well once I heard of Graham Hancock I was completely and utterly enthralled my ancient civilizations and the use of psychadelics. i had absolutely no idea that psychadelics have a very very long history. I was engrossed in it all. My days were spent reading trip reports and just learning as much as I could. Doing all that research was the first thing that really made me happy for the first time. Just the research alone made me start to realize how fucking wrong humans are nowadays. It made me realize how much I truly love this planet. It got me to get out of my house and spend hours in solitude in the woods. Of course though, I was still as depressed as they come. At that point though I was so used to it, I wouldnt have called it depression at the time. \nFast forward to about maybe 6 months ago and I had my first psychadelic experience. I took 2 grams of mushrooms and wow was I not prepared. It really kicked my ass. But out of it, I was shown how I dont appreciate anybody and how I abuse weed and how Im not doing anything with my life. So from that I forced myself to spend time with other people, I  started smoking much less, and all around it made me much much more appreciative. Things finally seemed to be going well. \nBut, the dark cloud over my head was still there. In my mind I couldnt get it out of my head that there is a demon attached to me or slowly possessing me or some shit. I was doing okay, but by then I realized I actually am depressed.\nSince then I learned to reshape my thoughts. I started using my bad thoughts to learn from, and realize that worries will solve absolutely nothing. I've also finally realized that in all honesty, \"demons\" and stuff like that is more than likely not real. Im sure I may have a dark energy attached to me but I don't believe its a aoul sucking beast from hell. I know I can cleanse myself, and I KNOW I can beat this. \nA few weeks ago though, I met my dream girl. I met the girl I didnt think could exist and if she did, why would she want anything to do with me? Well come to find out she loves all things spiritual and such and we've both never been able to freely talk to people about it. Theres just an incomprehensible amount of reasons that I think she's my soul mate. And you know what, since Ive met her, yeah I have some small rough patches, but I dont see myself sulking in sadness anymore. Im at the point where all these bad times and all these horrible situations that shroud my mind are able to just pass through now.\nI can honestly say I've never been so happy. Is this finally what it feels like to be human again?

Grand rising to my fellow spiritual brothers &amp; sisters. I\u2019ve been in a very indescribable phase in my life. \n\nIn the last year or so I have been slowly figuring out about spirituality, the patterns and life. At first, it was something I was gliding towards because all I could say about life was that it was energy. I never got super-deep, I just always had that feeling and followed that instinct. And eventually, this instinct lead me into deeper revelations of myself and this whole spiritual stuff. \n\nI had already constructed, from childhood experience, that I needed to control myself internally in order to create the life I wanted, externally. (#TheFormula) Plus, when I started smoking (organic and medical) weed, I was able to reconnect most dots.\n\nThen, one day I had the biggest spiritual awakening I ever had on LSD and quite honestly the first one of this level. I opened one of my chakra, I believe. I remember I was sitting down next to a friend of mine, listening to meditation music and within a second I spontaneously left my body and asked myself \u201cNO WAY THIS IS REAL!\u201d. I obviously panicked and was hearing voices from some of my friends who would say \u201cof course you\u2019re right, you\u2019ve always known\u201d (though they were not present) and immediately the voices merged into a very unknown yet distinct singular vibrating voice. It was telling me that everything was going to be alright and that I needed to trust this. I looked at myself, and I was literally blue, purple, cosmic alien looking (similar to those pictures that depict someone opening their chakras) and in a meditative position. Some of my deepest questions were answered as I was traveling lord knows where. The lights were bright at time, I felt like I had entered a close person\u2019s dream and then after I was zooming through space. And in the moment, I didn\u2019t grasp all right away because my level of awareness was just growing. And there was this last question at the end, where at my core I want to help everyone. I mean everyone, as I recognize I am a slave of nature and my duty is to help. However I panicked and I \u201cfell\u201d all the way down and back to my body and the unique voice merged into my friend who was initially laying next to me calling my name (like the dreams). I kept myself calm, and collected. Went in the bathroom, because it literally felt like I was in a roller coaster. When I came back, I asked my friend if he just left his body (now just like I was before, he sort of believed in those stuff but he didn\u2019t KNOW/Understand) and to him, I sounded like a clich\u00e9 psychonaut. However the feeling was so real, I still kept it cool. Till I realized, something. I\u2019ve been seeing faces all around the wall since this LSD trip, and figured it was normal, and asked if my friend was seeing them. My friend\u2019s look changed and he became stingy and in disbelief. In denial. He thought I was seriously delusional. But then, the faces started moving and laughing. And for the first time, the laugh of those faces took me over and I was laughing, hysterically (all while containing this flaming rage, from my friend who\u2019s always in denial. Because seriously know one likes to understand people further than their understandings of things). And immediately the room looked like a different dimension, like playdoh, and turned extremely dark except for my friend\u2019s body. And then *BOOM* my friend had an immense shiver. And as it happened, I screamed stop and the faces or whatever dispersed and went back to the wall. I continued laughing, as my friend rapidly hid under the blanket. And he asked me what it was. I naturally answered, the deads. \n\nThen my friend told me, I get it! What the fuck! And then told me he noticed that I had an aura around me and it was blue-white multicolored. I cried and told him that I\u2019m going through a lot and I cannot explain it. As if the world had given me an eye that would help me help others but never myself as the world would call out my greediness...\n\nMade some research and I want to say I may have lead my friend to have a semi kundalini awakening. However mine happened only one time and a bit later, where I explained to my other friend to align the bio-mechanical energy in his body. To feel his body through the stretches. And imagine the energy rise up and go to the middle of your forehead. Then the darkness when my eyes was closed turned into a bright light. As if I needed to open my EYE. And boom, I was in a different realm. I could see eyes everywhere similar to the faces I was seeing. However my friends voice, I could hear its core and it was filled with doubt anxiety and much more. I quickly realized I was not ready for this, and begged in my head to \u201cgo back\u201d repeatedly. \n\nNot to lie to you guys, it gave me a psychotic episode for almost a couple months. And now I\u2019m at this feeling of loneliness and despair because I feel so misunderstood. This community and the various others on the internet are the only places I feel understood.\n\nHopefully I can hear your own insights.

Only have an expectation of having a specific experience. You will be hard-pressed to be able to predict who, what, when, where, and how you will attract when attempting to attract, in order to manifest deliberately. This is because what you attract is a reflection of your entire being and essence. It is a reflection of who you are at your very core which is something that our intellectual thoughts can't comprehend.\n\nAlthough our logical mind is a wonderful tool, it doesn't have the final say in that which we draw towards us. We know so little about our entire mind, body, and soul. Our intellectual minds are limited to knowing our ego\u2019s identity, and not much more. Your conscious mind and all your mental developments, both socially and academically, are a single-digit-percentage of who you are as a whole. However, the universe reflects one-hundred-percent of who you are in all your attractions. Therefore, you will never attract who, what, when, where, and how you \u201cthought\u201d you would. That said, because like attracts like, and your manifestations are based on the elements you attract, the experiences you manifest will never turn out as expected.\n\nWhen you think of the term \u201cdeliberate manifestation,\u201d remember that it is possible for that manifestation to be twenty-percent deliberate if you only use your mind. The other eighty percent would then pan out by default according to who you are as an entire being. Therefore, events will not happen how you envision they would turn out.\n\nAt our level of spiritual development, it is almost impossible for any of us to grasp the totality of who we are, and that's what the universe reflects back to us. It reflects the totality of who we are, and last I checked we only use about ten percent of our brains. Our hearts and spirits are ageless. Our physical conscious minds are relatively new to an eternal universe. Our minds are new to an eternal universe that has been operating under the same rules for an eternity. Our mind is just a tool for us to be able to adapt to and navigate within this third-dimensional reality.\n\nAlthough our logical construct of thinking constitutes a very limited part of us as a whole, we still need our logical minds to be able to embrace the third-dimensional Earth-human experience, fully. That said, what must be understood about deliberate attraction and manifestation is the results of your efforts will never come to you in a clean, linear fashion as expected. Also, the results of your efforts will never come to fruition how you expected, or along the lines of a plot you expected.\n\nWhen attempting to deliberately attract and manifest, it is vital that you release your expectations. Put your thoughts to a minimum; follow your heart and raise your awareness. When you are ready to manifest and are deliberately intentional, you must get out of your mind and trust what happens. Follow your heart and stay aware because the five senses you use to navigate within this third-dimensional reality are incapable of navigating you through the shifts of higher vibrating events. Only your heart and spirit can do that. In other words, you must learn to trust your gut feelings all the while going with the flow. Of course, this is only when you are a fully intentional being.\n\nTo expand on the reality of actual manifested results, let's take the artist who would envision an art design then set forth to create it on canvas. This is the artist who is not sketching or copying from anything physical. This artist is copying an idea from her mind onto a physical medium. The artist who creates from a thought is very similar to how you will be manifesting. No artist ever ended up with the exact masterpiece envisioned before attempting to create it. Usually, during the process of creating an art piece, the artist hits many points of improvising through intuitive guidance. The artist is still focused on the idea, which is the intentional state of mind needed to follow through. Her intention to create a specific piece of art remains solid in her mind through the entire process. She also believes and knows the project will eventually get done. The rest is left to the joy of the process, and the emotions to be felt upon its completion. It's not uncommon for an artist to gaze upon their finished art in amazement and disbelief because it came out better than expected. An art piece that is perfect, and one-of-a-kind.\n\nWhen manifesting deliberately for the first time, the worst-case scenario is you won't get anywhere close to what you attempted to manifest, but instead, get closer to figuring out who you truly are and what you truly desire. You would figure this out by knowing where you started and realizing where you ended up. In this worst-case scenario, you will have a better reference for future manifestations. Once you have found enough of yourself, the fruits of your labor will be the life you truly desired all along. You will likely deal with turbulence towards this discovery. Once you unlearn to want what you are supposed to want according to the status quo, the ride will be smoother. Upon your coming to this conclusion and seeking what genuinely fulfills you, all those old empty feelings you once had will start to reside. Remember, your attraction, and manifestation results are directly proportional to all of who you are. All of who you are also includes your mind, but also includes your beliefs, intentions, feelings, genetics, experiences, and so much more. Everything that makes you uniquely you and only you is what makes your experiences unique from everyone else's. For many of you, this will be bad news in the beginning, yet great news towards the end of your journey.\n\nRemember to leave the micromanaging and technicalities for the universe to take care of. Just like when you are going to a beach to surf, you know that waves are being created and will continue to be created when you arrive. Your only task is to know how to get to the breaking point of the waves so you can ride them. That said, a lot of thought and planning happened before your coming here to Earth, and you had a lot to do with it. For that reason, you can not micromanage where you are. When you do return to the absolute, you can micromanage all you want because then you will be more of a creator who materializes your reality instantly. As for now, you are a manifester who lives off the fat of the land in this pre-created reality known as the relative.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~Nicholas D\u2019Arezzo\\~", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 72897, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why Your Deliberate Intentions Will Never Manifest \"Exactly\" As Anticipated", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e7ti2h/why_your_deliberate_intentions_will_never/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "usernamealrdytakn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kaud2l2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575808348, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e7t7kj/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is914/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e7t7kj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Enlightenment"}], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e7t7kj/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is914/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575808350, "score": 1, "selftext": "***Hare Krishna. Wishing a blissful Shri Gita-Jayanti to everyone.***\n\n***We will be Starting Bhagavat-gita Verse by Verse exercise again from 13th Feb 2020.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe mah\u0101tm\u0101 cannot be manufactured by rubber-stamping an ordinary man. His symptoms are described here: a mah\u0101tm\u0101 is always engaged in chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead. He has no other business. He is always engaged in the glorification of the Lord. In other words, he is not an impersonalist. When the question of glorification is there, one has to glorify the Supreme Lord, praising His holy name, His eternal form, His transcendental qualities and His uncommon pastimes. One has to glorify all these things; therefore a mah\u0101tm\u0101 is attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\nOne who is attached to the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord, the brahmajyoti, is not described as mah\u0101tm\u0101 in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. He is described in a different way in the next verse. The mah\u0101tm\u0101 is always engaged in different activities of devotional service, as described in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, hearing and chanting about Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, not a demigod or human being. That is devotion: \u015brava\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u012brtana\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25, smara\u1e47am, and remembering Him. Such a mah\u0101tm\u0101 has firm determination to achieve at the ultimate end the association of the Supreme Lord in any one of the five transcendental rasas. To achieve that success, he engages all activities-mental, bodily and vocal, everything-in the service of the Supreme Lord, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is called full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nIn devotional service there are certain activities which are called determined, such as fasting on certain days, like the eleventh day of the moon, Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b, and on the appearance day of the Lord, etc. All these rules and regulations are offered by the great \u0101c\u0101ryas for those who are actually interested in getting admission into the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the transcendental world. The mah\u0101tm\u0101s, great souls, strictly observe all these rules and regulations, and therefore they are sure to achieve the desired result.\n\nAs described in the second verse of this chapter, this devotional service is not only easy, but it can be performed in a happy mood. One does not need to undergo any severe penance and austerity. He can live this life in devotional service, guided by an expert spiritual master, and in any position, either as a householder or a sanny\u0101s\u012b, or a brahmac\u0101r\u012b; in any position and anywhere in the world, he can perform this devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus become actually mah\u0101tm\u0101, a great soul.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the various symptoms and activities of a mah\u0101tm\u0101 ?**\n\n[Picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/e7t74p/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is914/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 72894, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is--9.14", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e7t7kj/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is914/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "diannone", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_33f6cbwl", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575807826, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e7t50j/sunday_meditation/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e7t50j", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e7t50j/sunday_meditation/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575807826, "score": 1, "selftext": "***\"Life....\u00a0It is the flash of a firefly in the night,\u00a0 the breath of a buffalo in the winter.\u00a0 It is the little shadow, which runs across the grass, and loses itself in the sunset....\"***\n\n\\~[Crowfoot, Blackfeet Elder](https://www.donaldiannone.com/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 72893, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Sunday Meditation", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e7t50j/sunday_meditation/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Chelles3000", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1nq4rvv5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575805303, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e7st82/is_this_my_sign/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e7st82", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Spirit Guide"}], "link_flair_template_id": "6b76e192-ceef-11e9-820e-0e9c6e8dde10", "link_flair_text": "Spirit Guide", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e7st82/is_this_my_sign/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575805304, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi y\u2019all, it\u2019s my first time posting on here, so it might just be lengthy and have some grammatical errors, sorry. Also not sure if this is the right sub to post this, but imma go ahead...\nThis past week has been very interesting and emotional for me and I need some advice on how to go abt it diligently. \nLast month I watched The Avatar: The Last Airbender animated series and felt so drawn to learn more about spirituality and elements, and so I decided to start meditating. That didn\u2019t last long, maybe I was just too hard on myself to feel something that very first try.\nEarlier I realized I have a friend who emotionally drains me and I wanna tell her without hurting her feelings. It\u2019s family related but she\u2019s not doing anything to get herself out of that situation, she just talks abt it all the time ima depressing tone and sort of dismissed my efforts to help. And hearing the same thing every time we meet is draining me. I don\u2019t know how to tell her though.\nAlso, later this week, like 2 or 3 days ago, probably yesterday, I watched a YouTube video w a title along the lines of \u201cwhat\u2019s your spirit guide?\u201d The Tuber basically used tarot cards and other cards to tell the energy of the spirit guide and how to communicate or tell when they\u2019re communicating w you, and I got Kali Ma. And everything she said was true. I have a motherly spirit guide ready to protect em and remove anything that will hurt me. I\u2019m drawn by fire and I have always played w candles, played w the flames and always stood too close to the braai stand. And the colour purple which is my favourite colour (and orange) where constantly showing. But using numerology my spirit guide are Egyptian god and goddess Heru and Sekhet which from the brief reading I did, have pretty similar elements. \nTonight, I went on YouTube and a recommended video on the Avatar titled \u201ceverything is connected\u201d and then Alan Watts video on God popped up and now I\u2019m overwhelmed with so many emotions.\nAny advice?

My stamina is enduring, I will not be satisfied until you have reach maximum satisfaction.  Bah, I had went on to humor you enough.  I'm no swine, I have been short with women, I had been rude.  I am not much more than a jackass with women.  They become aware of my empathy quickly and they get very manipulative or creep out.  I am aware of these things, I mean, I'm still a horrible jack ass.  It's not as if you trust your instincts or anything.  Whether I'm a Class A Gentleman or a prick, fuck it.  On top of promiscuity, getting into an emotional relationship is a completely different endeavor.  Marriage is one thing, offspring are another.  \nI'm not getting any younger, I can't just drop some Angels off at the orphanage...  \n\nOR can I?  I would appreciate, by me, Lads, you're going to the Tom's House.  They will be of the upmost quality, outstanding noble and virtuous warriors, ultimately supreme.  Parents often inquire on losing children in war.  This world doesn't really deserve them, ilk is fine, I find no reason to bring further life into this suffering.  My bloodline has dealt with a grave deal of suffering, banishment and persecution.  \n\nWe were talking about the great pilgrimage to the America's during the colonial age... That's not all true.  People were banished here and into slavery in droves.  It was amid a coup back in Europe, amid various religious coups.  If you think your Four Fathers were great Pioneers prospecting the New World, it's probably not true, they were banished here.  Whether or not you can go back is unknown to me.  \n\nEgo isn't something you all enjoy, I am having a time parting with my ego.  I mean to humor others as well as share my experience.  I'm a peanut gallery, I guess, I do not trouble with it.  Writing is about my last artist outlet for expression.  I feel my cortex deteriorating as the years go by, I become more and more reptilian.  \n\nI go on about morality and ethics, stoicism/Taoism, emotional balance.  I reference to media, cartoons, Dragon Ball, Star Wars.  I'm failing to humor you apes and all your queer needs.  We're growing a liberal democracy, PUAH.  I am a person of conservative order but I'm not some dictator or fascist bastard.  I have my way, some have their own way, you have yours.  The goal of democracy is to reason with each others needs through conglomeration.  It's not always met, may be a hypocrisy riddled with corruption, if better aesthetically than fascism or strict oligarchy.  I try to go with the will of the masses, whether it is good or bad to me, plainly.  \n\nI am willing to part with affirming my views and values over seeing the desire of the masses.  Whether it's complete retardation and annihilation in and of its self, something order parted us from.  \n\nI have lost my train of thought here.  I mean, Good and Bad, Balance, Jedi, Stoic, Taoism.  Aliens, Genetic Engineering...  War, Slavery.  \n\nI just regress into the Viking Age.  The hearth there is strong.  I'm a fan of sci-fi, not fantasy so much.  Because, to me, it wasn't a fucking fantasy... It was painful, brutal and cruel.  Back then Men were made of more metal, mettle, slaying each other with steel.  The world was fucking collapsing amid war, religion, disease, virus, it was not a fantasy fucking world.  \n\n\n\n\nAlas,  \n\nCheers, Make Merry, Happy Holidays.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler":

I\u2019m a year and a half into my spiritual journey, and i feel like i\u2019m starting to get this shit down. \n\nI\u2019m beginning to notice that true happiness depends on your ability to get out of your head and experience the stimuli of the present moment. this is especially true when eating, driving, and having face to face conversations. put the fucking phone down and enjoy your food. enjoy every second of every bite. you\u2019re blessed to have the food in the first place, so act like it. enjoy the sunlight and the trees on the way to work. stop letting little irrelevant shit sabotage your thinking and feeling. embody a state of being and acceptance with the now. allow yourself to tune into the beauty and love that surrounds u. this is also known as tuning into love/god or whatever u like to call it, this state of being is very comparable to the way we lived as young children. happy, carefree, not taking anything too serious. we often let so much goodness and opportunity pass right on by us bc we\u2019re so caught up in the past or the future. \n\nalso understand that pain is good, pain is essential. and the more we seek it out, the more we will be rewarded for it. in doing so, we prove to the universe the we have no fear and that we value our life. one of my favorite quotes from terrance mekenna: nature loves courage and will remove obstacles when u remove your fear or objection of the obstacle.  this is the challenge in the game of life, guys. the mushrooms said so :)\n\nso to kind of tie these 2 ideas together: be present with the present...it\u2019s truly a meditative state to navigate your every day life and begin to experience so much pleasure from the littlest things. pure love and happiness is inside of you right now, so just start tuning in with it. also, learning from the past is important, but once you\u2019ve internalized it, it needs to be left alone. when pain shows up in the present moment, don\u2019t ignore it or resist it. feel every bit of it and know that it\u2019s something your meant to be experiencing. there\u2019s beauty  within even the most disastrous, painful moments.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 72809, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How to Win at Life", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e7o7hp/how_to_win_at_life/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "sugarthebook", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_56gwfjj6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575769922, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e7nf5o/new_book_out_sugar_the_supremeultimate_guide_to/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e7nf5o", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e7nf5o/new_book_out_sugar_the_supremeultimate_guide_to/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575769922, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI just finished writing and publishing my new book.

Also, have some patience with my intro, I am not trying to be disrespectful, I just try to be genuine about where I'm coming from and as you read on, you will see my view has changed.\n\nI consider myself the most down to earth person ever. I am an atheist, I am not spiritual at all, I have always believed that you live your life, then die, and that's it. I've been through a lot of trauma (childhood abuse from the age of 2-15, losing people, all that jazz), but I never searched or found solace in religion or spirituality, I thought it was a lot of mumbo jumbo (no offense! It was honestly how I viewed the world for the 31 years I've been roaming it). I never thought or believed that my dead loved ones were still near, nothing like that. I only believe(d) in what I can see and touch.  \nThis 'down to earth' personality of mine also never made me take anyone talking about spirituality, healing crystals, etc. seriously. I just rolled my eyes, nodded and accepted their truth but never once saw it as my own truth. Actually, I thought it was rather silly to believe in it. I'm sorry, it was just how I was, I don't want to lie about it here and act like I'm more spiritual than I am (or was...).\n\nAlright, so far for my introduction, just so you guys know where I'm coming from.\n\nSo, lately I've met a lady. Not someone that I would describe as spiritual, I thought she was (is!!!) this highly intelligent woman, and actually down to earth too. She always had a very high up job in the government, a very 'down to earth job', she is well educated, and just an all around incredible woman with a strong personality who instantly drew me (a guarded person who doesn't make friends easily because I find people overwhelming) in, and I've loved her from the minute I met her. We just connected on a deeper level at the second we met and locked eyes.\n\nSo, when she suddenly told me 'you are an earth angel and I hear a voice that told me to tell you that' I just couldn't help raising my eyebrow and feel slightly disappointed. Here is this lady that I like, trust, that just almost felt like an instant soulmate, and now she starts sprouting all this spiritual stuff that I don't believe in.\n\nBut, I couldn't help myself, I had to listen, I had to learn more. For hours and hours we talked. She kept telling me that I do not know it yet, but that I'm an earth angel. I politely declined being an angel of any kind, but she kept looking me in the eye and insisting. She even said that before meeting me she knew she would meet me, that the person that brought us together was sort of a 'tool' (sorry, English is not my first language, I hope you know what I mean by this word) to bring us together. Then she said all this other stuff, stuff she could NEVER know about me. Not from mutual friends, nothing like that. I live abroad, I hardly speak the language so there's no way these mutual, foreign friends, know this stuff about me, or stuff that happened 20 years ago, even if I wanted to tell them, I do not have the vocabulary for it.\n\nThe more we talked, the more intrigued I was. Angels, reincarnation, karma, etc. The things she said, how she could describe me (without knowing me!), for some reason I just knew this wasn't \"mumbo jumbo\", this lady is the real deal. She does not ask money, she doesn't go around telling everyone about earth angels, but she said that everything inside her just told her to tell me this, that I had to be aware of what I am, and even more so, how I can use those 'powers' to use. We have mutual friends, she never once mentioned her spiritual believes to them. It is personal to her, and she made it very clear that she saw it as her job to tell me about it. She even canceled stuff to be able to meet me, she really sees it as important.\n\nShe told me about a European lady, Dorien Somethingsomething, who wrote a book, and I curiously googled it. I found more information about earth angels, and even though it feels incredibly arrogant (and wrong) to call myself an angel of any kind, I did recognize myself in every single description. The caring side, being overwhelmed by people, the illness, the trust, people that tell me their stories, always apologizing for everything I say or do, the way I look (overweight, people that describe me as having an angel face with my blond hair and red cheeks), just everything matched me. Spiritual or not, this description matched me, no denying in that. I opened myself up for her, listened to her without any judgment.\n\nShe says she is a \"wise one\" ( excuse me if I use the wrong terms, as said, I am completely new to this and the Google searches I did were in my mother tongue), and she just flipped my world upside down. She seems so genuine, and it's not just the words she says, it's her whole presence. Getting a hug from her is like coming home, I can't even find the words to describe it. Something happens with her. She is truely a wise woman (not even in a spiritual or angelic way, just wise, intelligent, a very strong personality). And if there's any truth to angels, I have no doubt in my mind that she is what she says she is, this reincarnated wise soul who was put here on earth for a reason. Call me crazy, but I believe her, ever word she says, even though it's a 180 degree turn from my own (previous) believes.\n\nShe had a crystal with her and put it in my hands and told me to hold it. After a few minutes I gave it back, and the crystal was glowing hot. I naturally assumed that I just got warm hands, but when I tried to put the crystal in someone else's hand it didn't get nearly as warm as it did with me. Perhaps cold hands, or perhaps there is some truth to everything she says. I just don't know. She told me how she got the crystal and how it was from a very important person in her life that she lost, and then gave it to me to hold on to until she found me my own crystal. I just started crying, another weird thing, I havent cried in a decade, and here I was crying my eyes out because she trusts me with something so dear to her.\n\nAt some point I also told her she reminded me of a fictional person. She started to cry which surprised me, it turned out that I used the exact words and description that her dead beloved one used for her. No one else i her life every called her that and I swear to god that I had no idea that this fictional person (that she doesn't even physically resemble that much, the words just came to mind and I spoke them to her) was important to her.\n\nWe talked about physical pain that people had and that I took away (I just figured I'm a natural good masseuse?), about the fact that I was a 'miracle baby' from parents that miscarried a dozen times, who could not conceive. She put it all in perspective from the view of me being an earth angel (and my mother an elf?). That there was a reason why I was born with less than 1% chance, that I have a goal in this life.\n\nI just don't know where to go from here. What she said got me intrigued, I can't just tell myself that it's make-believe and that it's bullshit, because I feel deep inside that it's not.\n\nI've had hard times in my life, I tried to find churches, faith, a destiny for myself, but I never found it. And now, for the first time, I feel like there might be truth to this, to something I can't see, can't touch, but is as real as the grass outside and the walls around my house.\n\nI don't know what to do now. I can't find any forums in my mother tongue about this (they're all inactive), I do not want to visit a paranormal fair because I still feel highly uncomfortable with that stuff and I can't help it that my antenna will automatically search for bullshit there, plus, I don't even think that the country I'm in right now has that stuff, certainly not the remote area I am in right now.\n\nCan anyone point me in some direction here? Is this sub a good place to read and discuss angels, is there another sub for this stuff or another forum? What books can I read besides the one from Dorien Somethingsomething? Do you guys here believe in earth angels, star angels, wise angels and all that jazz? Or do you think someone is pulling my leg?\n\nI would really love to hear some input, because my head is overflowing right now, I have so many questions and thoughts.....\n\nI hope you guys won't take offense in anything I write, I just heard about this stuff a few days ago and had a long convo with the lady tonight and my mind is spinning and I just wish for some input from people who know what they're talking about, because this is all completely new to me, I know zilch. My interest is genuine, my believe in what this lady tells me is genuine, and my search for info here is genuine too. So please have patience with the stubborn, down to earth person I was, because I really want to learn.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 72796, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A lady told me I'm an earth angel.

Can ANYONE justify this to me?? I'm having a small/medium personal crisis. I've been listening to and enjoying Eckhart Tolle lately. But after curiousity led me to Google how much he's worth, and finding out he has over 50 million dollars, I wondered what he does with all that money, and why he doesn't give more or why he has a $90+ per 6 month online \"TV\" product. Wouldn't someone truely Spiritual who preaches letting go of attachment, and greed, and having compassion, give free talks or affordable talks? Why would he be catering to the middle class. And besides YouTube or a book exclude the masses? The relatively poor need it just as much if not more than those with disposable income. (As in more than enough money for everything you need to be comfortable and more, which I as well as the majority do not have the luxury of enjoying). Then last night trying to get to the bottom of it I saw someone else expressing the same concerns and the trend of Western teachers in general becoming millionaire and continuing to build their wealth like every other business man. But they're Not Business men. They're supposed to be spiritual teachers. It's contradictory and hypocritical as hell and I cannot trust someone who would do that. For example one of his 5 day retreats charged $1297 per PERSON, 500 PEOPLE attending... That's $648,500... NOT INCLUDING housing or food which you can book THROUGH THEIR COMPANY FOR A FEE... HOW could it cost well over half a million dollars to pay the people setting this up, and for the location/travel? Obviously he's got 50 million dollars for this reason. Essentially charging as much as he can because the wealthy will pay handsomely for the ultimate \"worldly possession\" \"enlightenment\". I'm basically crushed and at a loss. I cannot justify it. There's no evidence online that he does anything to help anyone with this intense wealth. When questions are asked he basically side steps it saying \"I don't really think about it\". OF COURSE YOU DON'T RIGHT BECAUSE THOUGHT IS AN ILLUSION, YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE THOUGHTS, SO OF COURSE YOU WOULD SAY THAT AND NO ONE CAN SAY ANYTHING BACK. \ud83d\ude14 Is there any truth. I feel like the world is completely full of misleading people and information.\nHis teachings can help temporarily, as long as you're ingesting more \"advice\" from a spiritual teacher. But none last, none seem to make lasting change.

I want to share an experience I had as a child in grade two. I\u2019m hoping someone can explain what happened, how, and what it reveals in spiritual terms. Hopefully this can spark a deep spiritual discussion.   \n\n\nSo growing up, random people always told my mom that I was a special/lucky child. Personally, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m special, but I have been woke since a pretty young age and now I am 22y/o. Anyways, the reason I mention this is because I experienced something in my grade two class that always made me feel like I had some hidden power that I wasn\u2019t aware of.\n\nI had a bully in the second grade who was just ruthless. As a gesture of respect, I won\u2019t mention his name as a gesture of respect. My bully didn\u2019t have any particular motive to bully me because I was pretty innocent, yet he did anyways. I\u2019m sure he bullied others too because it was in his personality. One day he was surprisingly acting nice and told me and my circle of friends that he will bring marshmallows for us the next day. Being young and innocent, I was super excited for this, especially because I didn\u2019t expect him to ever be nice. The following day comes and the bully indeed brings a bag of yellow banana flavoured marshmallow. He handed some to my friends and as I put my hand out smiling, he just said nah. I almost expected this too knowing how he always treated me. I was next level upset and heartbroken. Keep in mind I was an extremely sensitive boy and am highly sensitive till this day. The rejection killed me inside because I alone was targeted... I felt embarrassed, hated, and quietly cried. This was the moment I lost my innocence.   \n\n\nBeing so young, I had never actually understood the concept of God (though I had religious awareness). I remember clear as day how I closed my eyes in suffering and prayed intently and deeply to God. I told him that I hated the bully so much and wish that he dies. I remember clear as day that I made this specific \u201cwish.\u201d\n\nThe day ends, I go home, and eventually forget about that moment of intense passion in class. So I arrive to class the next day refreshed and renewed not thinking of the previous day. I enter the door and my teacher is crying, which I have never seen a teacher do before. I felt an eerie vibe and my heart pounded (not knowing why). Then she explained to us students that the bully is no longer with us because he was killed the night before. \\*Damn\\*  \n\n\nThe eerie vibe and the pounding in my heart amplified. I felt derealization as if I had just experienced a car accident. It felt like all the attention in the world was on me and I had something to do with this. Of course I felt how I did because I immediately recalled my wish from the day before and was shocked and speechless that it came true. I never told anyone about it up until last year when I had a peak in my depression and wanted to know whether I was guilty of my wish because it bothered me anytime I randomly thought of it.\n\nThis is a true story and an event I remember so damn clearly because of my connection to it. Needless to say, I always took the quote \u201cbe careful what you wish for\u201d seriously.  \n\n\nI wanted to share this here to see if anyone has had a similar experience or can explain this from a spiritual standpoint. Please avoid mentioning that it was a coincidence because my spiritual journey has taught me that everything is connected and children\u2019s innocence is powerful.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 72771, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A Child\u2019s Power to Kill", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e7j8ll/a_childs_power_to_kill/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "agreenfigtree", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3xrc4nwz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575748136, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e7iy3w/feeling_lost_do_i_not_have_a_guardian_angel/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e7iy3w", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e7iy3w/feeling_lost_do_i_not_have_a_guardian_angel/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575748137, "score": 1, "selftext": "I've been reading about angels and spirit guides, and I have very rational and grounded people in my life talk about their connections to spirits etc. However I've been mediating and asking for signs that I'm not alone, but these signs never manifest in my life.

WOW.\n\nSo I really want to start getting in contact with my spirit guide but I wasn\u2019t entirely sure how. The other night before bed I said \u201cspirit guide or guardian angel, I am open to you communicating with me in any and all ways. I\u2019d like to know your name. You can tell me in my dream tonight.\u201d Sure enough, they told me their name was Rose in my dream. \n\nI felt kind of skeptical that it just happened THAT easily for me my first time. I kinda just wrote it off as my brain dreaming it because I was thinking about it before bed, and because the name Rose really does sound like a name my head would make up for an angel or alike..\n\nWell, here\u2019s where I started to think otherwise...  today, my dad gave me a rose pin that he found at the thrift store. I hadn\u2019t mentioned anything about my dream or that I wanted to know my spirit guide\u2019s name. He found 2 of them. He gave the second rose pin to my mom. \n\nI think the rose pin may have been her sending me a sign that it wasn\u2019t just my brain dreaming it, running off with my half-asleep thoughts. I\u2019m also wondering, if this isn\u2019t a coincidence, that she may be my mother\u2019s angel or spirit guide too, since my dad found 2 and have one to each of us, but I don\u2019t know if spirit guides or guardian angels take on multiple people. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure what to think of it. I could be making it into something larger than it is.. I want to ask again before bed tonight to tell me their name but I don\u2019t want them to feel like I\u2019m not really being open to them Incase the pin was the confirmation... I\u2019m just new to all of this and I\u2019m the kind of person that needs to get the same answer twice to believe it, haha. \n\nHave you started communication with yours and what\u2019s the experience been like?\n\nThank you for your thoughts. \u2665\ufe0f\ud83c\udf39", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 72687, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My guardian angel/spirit guide is talking to me....

More like where I am going to go. I\u2019m also having anxiety with religion. Like there\u2019s so much to believe in and idk which one is right. I want to be in the right religion so I can \u201cmake god happy.\u201d I just don\u2019t know what is right. I don\u2019t think there even is a right. I feel as if your intentions are pure then you\u2019re good but yet I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s wrong. I really like spirituality though. It\u2019s really helped me grow but with that comes with so much anxiety. I\u2019ve been overthinking for the past few days and it\u2019s getting to the point where I feel really sad. I\u2019ve always wanted to meet my person. My \u201clife long partner\u201d but recently I keep thinking about him and I getting old. Have you ever watched the music video to mirrors by Justin Timberlake? If you have, have you felt the feelings it gives off. It\u2019s kinda sad but wholesome. I can\u2019t explain it. If you haven\u2019t watched it I suggest you watch it. Mute the song if you don\u2019t like it. The video is more where I\u2019m trying to get at. Some of the lyrics in the song makes the feelings heavier. That\u2019s how I feel with my love life. Mind you I\u2019m really young too. I\u2019m too young to even be thinking about this stuff. I\u2019m in my teens. I can\u2019t help it though. I\u2019m in my head a lot. I\u2019m alone a lot. People my age just don\u2019t understand me. I\u2019m okay with being alone though. It doesn\u2019t bother me anymore because I started to love myself. A lot actually. I\u2019m happy with my life. I\u2019m more grateful. I talk to a lot of people but I\u2019m really deep but I do have my childish moments. Though when I want to be deep or want to vent to someone I can\u2019t because I\u2019m pretty sure people my age don\u2019t want to talk about deep stuff and my emotions. So when I want to talk about things like that it\u2019s just really lonely. I don\u2019t have anyone to vent to so I just came here. You didn\u2019t really have to read this whole thing and some of you probably skipped everything and came to the end but some of you might have actually read this. For that you are great people. Even if you skipped it doesn\u2019t even matter you\u2019re great too. I can say at least 1 person read it. Anyways that was just a little vent. I\u2019m sick and tired of taking to myself, the angels, or god. They need a break. I\u2019ve talked their ears off for everyday for almost a year. Thank you for reading my craziness.\u2764\ufe0fI hope you\u2019re all doing well and if you aren\u2019t there might be nothing I can do except listen to you vent down below and pray for you intensely. I\u2019m not that good at giving advice so please don\u2019t expect some top notch advice.

what star signs are.** \n\nWhat are star signs? \n\nStar signs are the 12 30 degree sections making up the full 360 degree rotation of the earth. If you imagine a line going from the earth to the sun and beyond, that line draws the zodiac as a large circle as the earth rotates around the sun.\n\nThis large circle is called the 'ecliptic' which is essentially just a flat disk extending outwards in line with the earth and the sun. \n\nThis is different to the 'celestial equator' which is basically just the earths equator extended outwards The FOUR elements of star signs The 12 (well, 13 now) star signs can be sorted into FOUR basic elements. \n\nThese elements have certain characteristics which describe the star signs within them. \n\nFire \n\nAir \n\nWater \n\nEarth \n\nHere's what each sign GROUPING means. \n\nWATER SIGNS: Water signs are usually fairly emotional and sensitive. They're very clever, and tend to notice things very easily that most people might miss or ignore. They like keeping to themselves and tend to be introverts. They show lots of support and love to their close members of their inner circle, like friends and family. Water Signs are: Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. \n\nFIRE SIGNS: Fire signs are almost always very passionate and vivid. They can tend to get angry easily and easily emotional. That being said, they do also forgive people who have wronged them quickly. they act in the moment, with passion and emotion. They're highly intelligent and strong. Fire Signs are: Aries, Leo and Sagittarius.\n\nEARTH SIGNS: Earth signs usually tend to be grounded and calm. They're realists and like being practical and sensible. That being said, they can also be emotional, just like the fire signs. Because they're SO grounded in the physical reality, the tend to be more likely to obsess over money or physical items. Earth Signs are: Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn. \n\nAIR SIGNS: Air signs are social creatures. They like thinking, talking and interacting. They're airy and free, and don't like being tied down to things like jobs or even places for too long. Because of their light and free thinking, they enjoy deep philosophical discussions and ideas. Air Signs are: Gemini, Libra and Aquarius. Important note about star signs Make sure you understand that you can ALWAYS have exceptions. \n\nThese groupings and their descriptions are not always accurate. You can have an emotional Air sign or a grounded fire sign. It doesn't really have to align always with these descriptions. \n\nThat might help you understand why they may not match up perfectly for you or someone you know. What are the 13 star signs \n\nThe 12 signs in order are: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces There are 13 signs in total, because we've only just discovered a NEW star sign making it 13 total. \n\nThis new star sign is called Ophiuchus.\n\n[*READ FULL ARTICLE*](https://astralhq.com/star-signs-zodiac/) *to learn what the star signs mean, dates and more about the new star sign.*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 72565, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "13 Zodiac star signs explained for beginners (including the new one)", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e6xu2r/13_zodiac_star_signs_explained_for_beginners/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "NsfwOlive", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_hju4j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575631847, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/e6xlfa/fear_of_responsibilities/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e6xlfa", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/e6xlfa/fear_of_responsibilities/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575631849, "score": 1, "selftext": "I grew up with parents that made sure that I didn't have any responsibilities until adulthood.

Ever since I have been practicing SemenRetention, eating well, working out, RV, RI I have noticed that I (especially at times of high/good energy) I carry an intense feeling around with me sometimes. \n\nThe easiest way for me to test and prove is by looking at people, especially in passing. I consciously be testing this after I began to notice it and I'll look at someone and immediately they'll either immediately perk up and look around and usually they also look my way like their looking at something. Many times, they'll just turn their head and look right at me and look down quickly.\n\nToday was even more intense. I saw a friend in the distance but she was to far to say high. Once I realized it was her (she was pretty far away) I'm like \"Oh hey it's Becky\" while looking at her and she immediately looked up on alert and started looking around like she was trying to find something. I stopped and she stopped so I experimented and tried it again so I looked at her and think again and she immediately looks up again and turns her head around and this time she looks right at me. After this, it has left me convinced.     \n\nI'm curious why this is happening and what this means. It doesn't happen ALL the time and with certain people but I have noticed this happening a ton recently. Does anyone have any knowledge on the situation?

So is it really you? The real deal?\n\nJesus: Well, I did promise I'd be here, and at this time.\n\nSanta: Yes, but I wasn't expecting you to look like . . . Do you think anybody's going to . . . notice us, meeting like this?\n\nJesus: Maybe, but so what? You\u2019re obviously a shopping-mall Santa, and I just got hired as a dishwasher. Who's going to care if they see two working stiffs taking a mid-afternoon break in a nearly-deserted diner?\n\nSanta: Well . . . nobody, I guess. And since I didn't dare tell anyone else about this, I guess it has to be you. So thank you so much for answering my prayer and meeting with me. I'm unbelievably thrilled and honored.\n\nJesus: And so am I, to meet with you.\n\nSanta: *You?* *Honored* to meet with *me?* Wow! Just wow! That totally blows my mind.\n\nJesus: Why should it? You're a human, aren't you? And as one who should know, I can tell you there's no more divine creation anywhere. But that isn't what you wanted to talk about, right?\n\nSanta: No, not really.\n\nJesus: So out with it.\n\nSanta: Well, I've been doing this Santa gig for fourteen years now, and there's something about it that's just always bothered me.\n\nJesus: Which is . . .\n\nSanta: It's like at Christmas, we live a double life. We do the Santa Claus thing with the whole ritual of reindeer and presents under the tree and so forth, and then at the same time we do the Mother Mary, baby Jesus, and wise men ritual. But they're completely separate. They're like parallel universes, both about Christmas, but each one pretending the other doesn't exist.\n\nJesus: Yeah, I know what you mean.\n\nSanta: It's just weird, but nobody wants to admit it. The other day I was walking by a nativity scene on the town square, and a thought came to me. What if I were to set up my chair right next to that scene, and put up my sign inviting children to visit with me and tell me what they want for Christmas? What do you think would happen?\n\nJesus: People would be startled and uncomfortable. Some would even be offended.\n\nSanta: Do you think I'd get any kids on my lap?\n\nJesus: That close to simulacra of Mother Mary and baby me? Hard5 ly. Parents wouldn\u2019t allow it. Too scary.\n\nSanta: Right. So look, if you had to sum up, in just one word, the meaning of Christmas according to your story, what would it be?\n\nJesus: Salvation.\n\nSanta: Exactly. And for my story, the one word would be joy. As in merriment, good cheer, and the sheer fun of giving and receiving. So why can't salvation and joy mix? Openly acknowledging and supporting each other like best friends, for God's sake? After all, they both celebrate Christmas.\n\nJesus: Well, they do mix when people go caroling, where songs about Santa Claus and baby Jesus get mixed together all the time.  Same thing for the piped-in music in stores and restaurants this time of year. Some of those songs are even about joy to the world and the rapture of angels, so there's joy in my story as well as yours.\n\nSanta: I know, but what happens in carols and what happens down on the street, with real people, are two different things. I still can't get anywhere near a nativity scene, heaven forbid. Like I would contaminate it or something. Nor could I show up at a Christmas church service in my Santa Claus outfit. People would freak out. Why *is* that? It just really bothers me.\n\nJesus: It's partly because for most people in your culture, there are two kinds of joy, serious spiritual, and playful everyday.  And those two steer strictly clear of one another. \n\nSanta: What do you mean?\n\nJesus: Think about it. When have you ever seen a rendering of Jesus laughing or smiling? Say, like the original Santa, the right jolly old elf.\n\nSanta: Actually, I think I did once, somewhere, and I was shocked. I thought it was disrespectful.\n\nJesus: And can you imagine Jesus merrily dancing about? Say, to some good hip-hop?\n\nSanta: Good Lord, no! Blasphemy.\n\nJesus: Exactly. Most people want their Jesus to be stone-cold serious and dignified. Which scares them into being equally serious and dignified in their dealings with me. So fine, go ahead, be as righteously joyful about me as you want. Just be sure to do it in a super-reverent way, serious as a constipated owl.\n\nSanta: Ha ha. That's a good one.\n\nJesus: Thank you. I stole it from you humans. Who think it's fine for them to have a sense of humor, but God forbid that Jesus should. Even though she obviously invented humor.\n\nSanta: Ha ha again.\n\nJesus: Right, and for that reason most people would think there's no way a conversation like this could ever happen. Or that Jesus could have a robust sense of humor. Or even smile at you in a truly warm and personal way, for heaven's sake.\n\nSanta: But why *is* that? Why do you always have to be so serious?\n\nJesus: I don't, of course. I could be just as outwardly happy as you at your finest. Cherubic cheeks, benign and frequent laughter, delighting children with affable cheeriness. But it would distress people in your culture to see me acting so undignified. And since super-serious is the only image of me they allow in their mind, they think that must be the way I am. Very unlike jolly old Santa, who therefore needs to keep a respectful distance, thank you very much.\n\nSanta: Ah, so that's why we have these two parallel Christmases that don't speak to each other: Jesus, with serious joy, and Santa, with playful joy. For everyday real people, they just don't mix.\n\nJesus: That's it in part. But there's another, deeper reason.\n\nSanta: Which is . . .\n\nJesus: That most people venerate Jesus as a divine, sacred, and exalted being, whereas they view Santa Claus as a sort of magically dear, sweet, generous uncle. Which means the two of them are seen as separated by vastly different spiritual rank. Which in turn means they should *not* associate with one another as equals. Just as some people of exalted social status wouldn't be caught dead, as you so morbidly put it, schmoozing equitably with people of much lower social rank.\n\nSanta: So are you saying that Santa Claus and Jesus are equal?\n\nJesus: At the heart of their divinity, why not? People tend to think\u2014weirdly enough\u2014that God created all kinds of things that somehow manage to have much less worth and divinity than himherself. They can handle the idea that Jesus is more or less equal to God, but they can't stomach the thought that everyday humans\u2014including shopping-mall Santas\u2014are even in the same spiritual ballpark, let alone equal in any sense. Even though their Bible explicitly says they're made in the image and likeness of God. And even quotes me, for chrissakes, as declaring, \"Have I not said, ye are Gods?\" The irony is just so stark. Most of you have a truly massive spiritual inferiority complex.\n\nSanta: Which is why you have to safely look like a dishwasher, just in case someone walks in and sees us sitting here talking.\n\nJesus: Right. No way I could look like the almost mournfully solemn, colorfully-robed, super-exalted Jesus depicted in your paintings. And talking with a shopping-mall Santa as an equal? As if we had something important in common? Forget it, bro.\n\nSanta: So is there anything we can do about it?\n\nJesus: Your culture isn\u2019t going to change overnight. But a play or movie could be written, and widely performed or seen, that captures the spirit of Christmas in the joy created by Santas like you interacting with the joy aroused by baby me, and how they're both divine. Who knows, maybe with a clever plot of initial estrangement and conflict, then unexpected developments and a breakthrough, Santa and Jesus could shake hands at the end, friends at last. Shocking everyone.\n\nSanta: For sure. But wait a minute, I caught something there. What I do when I delight children is . . . divine?\n\nJesus: Absolutely. As divine as anything I've ever done. What could be more divine than the shining eyes and burbling laugh of a delighted child?\n\nSanta: Umm . . . nothing that I can think of.\n\nJesus: In essence, the whole Santa-Jesus divide is a reflection of estrangement from your own immense divinity, three vital signs of which are everyday joy, humor, and delight. \n\nSanta: Whoa, what a mind-bending thought! Huh! This has all been just so . . . well . . . divine. Thank you so, so much! But look at the time. I've got a gig over at the mall in just a few minutes, so I better get going.\n\nJesus: And I've got to get back to that stack of dirty lunch dishes. So listen, do the children and me a favor, if you would, and create some divine joy, laughter, and delight while you're there. After all, it isn\u2019t really just about presents. And please do go to a Christmas service\u2014maybe in a more open-minded church at first\u2014in your Santa Claus suit. Make people think. Start bridging that gap between us.\n\nSanta: I'll do that.

It's not just a surface-level fear of being hurt by the phenomenal world of people and things, but there seems to be some deep-rooted, primal fear which resists the very fact of life itself. The experience of existence is in fact so absurd and bizarre that we refuse to become fully aware of its presence. \n\nFrom what I've observed in myself and others, there are two typical responses to this fear. The first is to convince ourselves that existence is actually *normal*, that there's nothing interesting here and the best thing to do is to create comfort for ourselves. We become so ignorant of the fact of life that we forget there really is something there to be surprised by in the first place. The second response is to accept this absurdity as an insurmountable fact, and to surrender our life force to it. This is what we call depression - because there is so much to fear in the unknown, we become convinced that we have already been conquered by it. \n\nBoth of these efforts create a false veil. We become convinced that the fact of our own existence is somehow separate from the fact of existence itself. We start asking questions like \"why me?\", \"what if I was born in another body\", and many other inquiries based in ignorance. By defining our life as independent of basic existence, we create what I call the *fear of basic responsibility*. At some level we understand that we *are* the very fact of existence itself, that this body is not us relating to this world but rather the world relating to itself. The veil is to help us ignore this suspicion. \n\nWe've all known that person who puts off paying a bill for longer and longer, pretending that it doesn't really exist and therefore their actions have no consequences. This is how many of us have been living our lives - we pretend that *existence isn't absurd*, or even more foolhardily, that *existence isn't our basic condition.* If it isn't absurd then we don't have to acknowledge any conflict. If it isn't our basic condition then there's nothing we can do to overcome its enormity, so it wins automatically. Either way we avoid responsibility. \n\n(sudden change to second person)\n\nThe way to take responsibility for this basic fact of existence is to acknowledge it, fully. This is why awareness plays a huge part in spirituality - it is the lens through which your being acknowledges its own being. In order to touch your awareness upon the fact of existence, you must first strengthen its power through mindfulness. Mindfulness is your way of watching thought patterns and breaking your relationship with them.\n\nOnce your awareness is shifted onto basic existence (that thing which underlies everything), you'll realize that words and ideas and thoughts never even touched upon its truth. They were all deceptions to help you cope with the fear of what the truth might do. And, in fact, the truth will do exactly what you feared it would do - destroy your notion of self. Every story you've created vanishes, only to be replaced with the undeniable fact of that which is before you (and which *is you*). Yes, reality is absurd, and yes, from the perspective of your self it is very scary. If you want to find your place in this world, this seems to be the cost of entrance that you should face both of these aspects.
