I've been going through this shift for a while now. The main reason I became so self aware is because of my relationship. Its the pin point of where I started healing. Its proving to be a difficult settlement in my spiritual journey. I love this person- care for them alot. Ever since this happened to me Ive felt so distant from him because of the inner issues Im having with my self awareness. He is trying so very hard to work with me but I don't represe my emotions anymore and can become intense in a way no one excepts it and it throws off all the vibes. Its happening in family relationships too. I just see through alot and when I get upset theres no staying quiet about it. I want to continue healing and awakening and also heal the relationships I have with others, never felt more balanced, myself and so misunderstood. Anyone else relate or some something to share?

I am uncertain of if I was famed, Crixus or Spartacus.  I've reviewed the old film with Kirk Douglas in Spartacus.  There is role reversal in this film... If you watch it reverse Spartacus with Crixus.  I am uncertain if that is true, but, that is my vision.   The STARz show \"Spartacus\" was actually something I enjoyed and their portrayal of Batiatus was somewhat more accurate.  That Lanista was extremely cruel and warped.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCrixus and Spartacus were not really the bullies you might imagine, they were great soldiers, not bullies, really stand up to newcomers. Even though I was a murderer, I did not sympathize with myself.  I loved being a Gladiator and did not mind the shortcomings of caged living, only got cold and hungry at times.  There were only occasionally more than porridge to eat, maybe a lamb chop and some grapes on occasion.  There was this Ash drink they served us daily to compensate in nutrients... It was burnt vegetables, meat, vegetation, whatever...  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think Crixus and Spartacus were Gladiators for something like 10 years, they loved being Gladiators. The revolt took place because Batiatus kept putting off their bond.  However, I was told they were to be made Legatuses before the revolt took place.  However, during the revolt Batiatus and everyone were slaughtered.  The Gladiators went on an merciless massacre of that entire village, the countryside and the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my vision I was the \"Thracian\" that was captured, I wasn't not Thracian, I was Spartan.  The Starz show is a complete mind job, some of it is accurate.  His Wife was raped and murdered in front of him, then he finds out she is still alive,  Batiatus later brings her corpse to him later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe revolt is a shame...  I am uncertain how long the rebellion took place.  I have only the vaguest imagery and was captured and crucified.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnjoy yourselves, dance, sing, make merry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46193, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Spartacus", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563747374, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cfrng8/spartacus/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "boililikoi", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_31d93twr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563658097, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cfr4u9/mixing_dreams_with_realities/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cfr4u9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cfr4u9/mixing_dreams_with_realities/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563658098, "score": 1, "selftext": "I often find myself confusing the two states (which one is \"real\")--like the other day, I lost my key in \"reality\", but found it in a \"dream\"... then yesterday I found something in a \"dream\", and keep looking for it in \"reality\" (after awake), but only to realize it's not \"real\"...", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46186, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Mixing \"dreams\" with \"realities\"?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563744478, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cfr4u9/mixing_dreams_with_realities/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "gllg212", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1vndpigv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563656448, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cfqtyi/seeking_a_soul_mate/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cfqtyi", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cfqtyi/seeking_a_soul_mate/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563656450, "score": 0, "selftext": "Why can one only have one soul mate in a life time--I never got the concept?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46180, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Seeking a soul mate...", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563742833, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cfqtyi/seeking_a_soul_mate/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TheEternalCosmic", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2qi0qvs8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563654469, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cfqgf3/hello_all_i_am_a_gifted_member_of_the_hybrids/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cfqgf3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 34, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cfqgf3/hello_all_i_am_a_gifted_member_of_the_hybrids/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563654469, "score": 1, "selftext": "Love and light to all of you.

The absurdity of this has only now started to sink in, it's been going on years.  I had crossed paths with Gods, Angels and Demons in the past.  I had been told over the years I was the re-incarnation of Zeus, Jesus, Thomas, there is more I can say.  I am uncertain if the Christ and Jesus may be the same, I had visions of being with him in Israel.  I was the slave he bought and was crucified for blasphemy.  I may have been the holy ghost, as I appeared afterward in my spirit form and was cutting up with the local's, before being absorbed by Ouranos or Zeus.  I am actually certain which diety I may be.   \n They said I was Zeus, but there's still other Chieftains in the Sky, Ouranos, Marduk, Poseidon, even Loki seems to be deified.  I was undeified thousands of years ago and work as a mortal Man.   Sky Father reincarnated me in one place or another, I'm more or less left to function with my free will.  The others come after me or do not, I had been assassinated, sacrificed, murdered over the ages, crucified, burned at the stake, multiple times.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApproaching the Church is comically overwhelming, at least the Papa is appearing as an approachable and generous man, not cruel and ruthless as they had been in the past.  I could tweet the Papa, I guess.  I have no idea what Michael is doing, I dodge that individual with all the wits of my being.  I do not even believe in organized religion or these dogma's.  My hearth is in Norse Lands and I have an affinity for their myths.  While the myths may or may not be true, some of it is true and all sacred to Norse Lands and it's people in good humor and morale, as with other Kingdoms and their beloved mythology.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not believe in organized religion, even though in it's infrastructure it is supposed to work with the nobility and aristocracy.  The Gods and Nobles go into coups over the centuries, many bloodlines had been killed off, exiled or gone into subterfuge over the centuries.  I do not know who exactly is running things, the Gods seem to be loosely apart of an oligarchy but not in exact political roles, some are in exile.  The other Kingdoms having adopted a more American ideal of western government and structure's, congress and legislatures. I do not know what is going on with the Aristocracy over there, nor do I particularly care.  I am focused more over not getting assassinated and trying to keep my mind together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not a political person myself, I'm a militant person and prefer that environment.  I am not the power hungry authoritarian type, I only lead out of necessity, while I am capable of being a good commander.   I am Earth and blood, manslaughter and carnage is the composition of my soul.  My coping devices have been quite impressive, I don't feel the pain and burning now, it only haunts me in memory.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to inquire.  I am not trying to prove anything, or get slaughtered by the Norsemen.  I had no control over these abominations, warfare or anything.

I stepped out of my office to go to the bathroom. On my way back to my office I came across one of my coworkers and she stops me to ask if I can print out some paperwork for her. \n\nThis is where it starts to get WEIRD! I start becoming hyper aware of my inner chatter and it went something like this: \" Omg, this girl is so happy! How is she so happy at work! I wonder what she's thinking about?\" I brush it off  though and proceed to my office. I quickly print out what she requested and then she leaves.\n\nI begin working, typing up some documents when all of sudden it begins to get WEIRDER!!\n\nI literally, no joke, find myself hovering over my body looking at my self typing. It's almost like I am seeing myself 3rd person, it freaked me out so much I guess I popped back into my body and right away I KNEW I was high off cannabis. I grab my purse and jet out my workplace. I was hoping noone would stop me on my way out because I had no idea how I would respond. Luckily, I make it to my car and now I don't know what to do. I have to think quick cause I am still at the premises of my work and I didn't want anyone to spot me. So..i decided I need to get out if here and remembered Target is down the street maybe I can park there. So I drive to target and park my car. I feel safer now that I am not on grounds at my job but still tripping out! What's happening to me? Imagine feeling super high and having no idea why. I'll explain shortly how this came to be lol. Anyways, as I'm sitting in my car I call my boyfriend. I tell him that he needs to come pick me up, I am high ass fuck but don't know why or how it happened. He laughs at me in disbelief but soon starts believing me by the tone in my voice. He agreed to come pick me up it would take him about an hour to get to me but I had no other choice as I was clearly to intoxicated to drive. \n\nSo in the time I'm waiting to get picked up, I start to feel like im getting higher and higher. But I told myseld not to freak out because I still needed to tell my boss I wont be coming in to work for the remainder of the day. As I am trying to focus on sending him a text.. I feel myself getting fearful and thinking what if I get fired or he doesn't belive what I tell him. By the way I just made up some lie about throwing up and feeling ill. But when I noticed the fear I had I got a download as well. It was a message that has stuck with me for nearly over 4 years now. And it was : wait, why are you scared? You are not an employee, you are not a daughter, you are not a girlfriend, you are NOT all these things you think you are. You are NOT what you identify with, you are NO-THING, therefore you are EVERYTHING. At your true core you are pure light, love and conciousness. The fear vanished the joy overcame me. I then just sqt in my car turned up the music and became one with it. To know that I am much more than what I thought I was is life altering. Now I don't stress that much about anything because I know that I am nothing. Anyways most of you are probably thinking I am crazy and wondering how I accidentally got high at work. Well i didn't figure it out til the next day. Yup I was high for an entire day! When my boyfriend picked me up finally what seemed like hours (it was just 1 hour) he was schocked to see how red my eyes were. If he didn't belive me now he did lol. I could barely make out a sentence, He drove me home and I stayed asleep until the next day. I had to call off sick and once I started to feel back to normal I started back tracking trying to figuere out how the fuck did I get high?!?\n\nThe Backstory on how I accidentally got high:\n\nSo I glued the pieces together and the night prior to this my boyfriend was using some of my pots to make some concentrated cannabis for syringes. Not sure how the process works but what I do know is that he used a saucepan to heat the cannabis concoction he had made and placed a lid over it to evaporate it. After he was done he washed the sauce pan but placed the lid(unwashed) on the counter.\n\nWhen I got home from work, I decided that I wanted to prepare lunch for tomorrow.  So I cooked me some soup! I saw the lid was on the counter mind you it looked clean and I was super tired so decided to just place it on the saucepan that I was cooking my soup in. \n\nYou guys, the cannabis had evaporated residue on the lid! When my soup was boiling the cannabis residue from the lid dropped back into my soup. The same soup I had for lunch at work the following day. I believe I ingested very very HIGH amounts of cannabis because the effects lasted for so longgg. \n\nAnyways, as scary as it was I wouldn't changed it for anything because it made me realize that alot of my suffering was coming from what my ego identifies as versus what my higherself truly is that which is pure love energy and part of infinite conciousness.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46107, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I (accidentally) got high at work", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563696196, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cfjebf/i_accidentally_got_high_at_work/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Karmicpatterns", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3z2ygbu3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563606520, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cfj0sc/your_soul_is_calling_so_pick_up_the_godamn_phone/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cfj0sc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cfj0sc/your_soul_is_calling_so_pick_up_the_godamn_phone/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563606521, "score": 6, "selftext": "*Ring ring*\n\nIts your soul it wants to remind you that you came here for a reason.\n\nYour existence isn't by accident.

Whether it's death or talking to a girl. Take action in your life. Don't hide in fear, don't hide in a shell because setting limitations on your own life will only take you so far. We as human beings have achieved such great things. What's stopping you from doing something great in life. Some might say i have depression or i have anxiety. Those things are fear and boundries in life. We've overcame some many harsh things in life and yet some people decide to choose death over anything else. Think deeply and find the hatred and pain in your mind and let it all go. They might be afraid of seeking change or be afraid of even thinking about change for the better. Their minds are pessimistic, they think that only bad things will happen to them but in they don't know that. It's just their mind telling them to stop and to stay in the hole of despair. In reality there's an underlying fear in people's minds that stops them. They might care about what others think of them. They might be self conscious. The only person stopping them from achieving greatness is themselves. There might be people who are roadblocks in their life, they just have to get up and throw them out the fucking way. It's just a mindset, when the brain goes through an underlying loop of sadness or trauma. Their mind constructs a pessimistic view and that view alone, takes away their hope and their trust in people. You just have to get up and believe in yourself.

Whether it's confidence, lots of pride, low self esteem, or even just feeling lonely, all of these aspects are a part of one's ego. Even something as simple as considering one's religion, morality, good, evil, beliefs, or titles is considered a form of ego. In the end, any obsession with self (no matter how slight) will be a detriment when meditating and when making an attempt to experience spiritualism to it's fullest. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn order to experience meditation and spiritualism in it's fullest is to separate from the self and experience the entirety of the universe in its fullest. The more attachments one has to themselves more one is chained down from exploring further. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne common example are people meditating to \"Meet God\". This can be accomplished, but that would end up being the limit; one would not discover the immense things beyond \"Finding God\" and not meet minds that are so high in reason that it's almost mechanical, understanding how \"young\" the devils/demons are in comparison to entities like the moth-like hive mind, reaching an understanding that the \"older\" and/or \"greater\" a spirit is the less likely they have a name, and many other aspects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe more attachment one has to one's ego and knowledge, the more this limits what one can explore and learn. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThus, one has to let go of the idea of soul mates, pride, high/low self esteem, religious affiliation (religious morals are highly important though), good/evil, god/devil, and just about everything else in order to delve \"beyond the known\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne should also let go of the preconceptions such as \"light is good\" and \"dark is bad\", because these things can also be opposite depending on who/what you meet. An example is one that becomes prey to others when seen in light and thrive fullest when not seen in the dark; for such entities the light is evil and the dark is good. Demons and devils are the same way as they are seen as \"rampant and immature children\" in the eye of other entities. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's certainly more when it comes to spiritualism, but this topic is only a light reminder as to why ego holds one back in spiritualism.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46032, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A few reasons why Ego is a detriment to Spiritualism and Meditation.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563653444, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cfcibm/a_few_reasons_why_ego_is_a_detriment_to/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "kayla7kk", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_345poogn", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563566959, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cfchks/heal_insecurities/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cfchks", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cfchks/heal_insecurities/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563566960, "score": 6, "selftext": "I think my whole life thus far I have been attempting to heal/negate my life of the insecurities I have accumulated.

Because even if I do feel that way, there is still love within myself to give. I've gone through personal experiences met by lack of human support that has driven me to places of unworthiness; feeling as if I am not wanted around, or not relevant enough to be genuinely thought of. I've learned that the people who I hold close to me do not have intentions of hurt, so feelings of unworthiness are not purposefully inflicted but indirectly constructed. These feelings have been felt through actions or lack of. To many of my closest loves, I have expressed at one time or another that I have felt as if I was not receiving the love that I believed I deserved, and those people, because they loved me enough, showed me not with words but with actions how much I mean to them. And those that refused to change their ways, I no longer pour out my own energy for them. If you feel like you are unappreciated by those you care about, you have to say something. Letting yourself think that you are someone who isn't capable of being loved the way you love will only cycle through your own mind until you come to a conclusion that you are undesirable. That is not the case. Be pure in your intentions to love--both giving and receiving. Speak out when you feel as if your efforts aren't being met, people who genuinely care about you will show you with their reaction. They will either change how they care for you, or remain in their ways. And that's okay either way, you are the one who has to make the active decision from there whether or not you're going to exert your energy toward these unchanged people. You are growing, you are learning but you are also teaching. I hope one day to reach a level of confidence in myself that my love will absolutely be the only love that makes me whole! And I hope the same for all you humans!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 46032, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Heal insecurities", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563653340, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cfchks/heal_insecurities/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "asutintaylor", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3u07q9nq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563566915, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cfcha9/thought_id_share_just_something_i_scribbled_it/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cfcha9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cfcha9/thought_id_share_just_something_i_scribbled_it/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563566916, "score": 2, "selftext": "we are here for something greater \n\nhere to experience joy, experience love, &amp;

I\u2019ve done my best by removing myself from most of my family. I grew up in a fatherless home so there were certain things I had to learn on my own. My relationship with my mother and sister is very toxic. My sister is an addict, and my mom is just very angry. The only way my mom communicates is by yelling.

I\u2019m always the one that is blamed when ever there is an issue. I\u2019ve learned over the years to speak my truth when it comes to the both of them. Our relationships became toxic after I got married. I decided to start speaking my truth even if it did hurt anyone\u2019s feelings. Things went way down hill when I started to put my husband first as well. I couldn\u2019t allow them to continuously disrespect him. They felt that I was betraying them. I feel like they want to control my life in a sense. There are days when I get stuck in my thoughts just thinking about everything they have done to me. I\u2019m always the one to reach out to them, and apologize, but they can never do the same. Times I have poured my heart out to them, and stated how I feel,  just seems like it goes in one year and out the other. I found myself being so stressed and emotionally stressed when I continued to have them in my space. I\u2019m trying to do better by myself, husband, and children. I know that these women are family, but why should I choose to be around people who bring such toxicity in my life? My own mother doesn\u2019t even know she has another grandchild on the way. I have chosen not to tell her, or the rest of my family. No one seems like they are truly happy for me... For the first time in my life I feel good about  myself.

I\u2019ve gotten rid of every bad habit that you could imagine (nofap, not destroying myself while indulging on caffeine). There was something always inside of me that kept saying \u201cfeed me so I can stay alive!\u201d Which would be Satan needing his fuel so he can function to destroy my Life in his own ways. Well, I drowned Satan out. I didn\u2019t feed him any longer and he tried attacking me in my dream. \nThere was another person in my dream as well, it was a girl. I tried saving the girl but she was too far in with Satan\u2019s game and I noticed she was almost irreversible to try and help. I did all that I could, but in my dream, Satan had showed me that if I were to help her any more then I would become just as parasitic as she was (thus Satan had put so many parasites and grubs inside my body to the point I couldn\u2019t breathe. I had one final request. I had told Satan to heal me from what he\u2019s doing to me &amp; I will not help her anymore because I realized you cannot help a person who doesn\u2019t want to help themselves.) so Satan had took her soul, and he used some sort of cane or maybe it was his claw to heal me from what he did to me, realizing I no longer am of his. So Satan healed me from his own doing, while in return Satan took a girl\u2019s soul. I had told Satan Thank You for releasing me from his grips &amp; up in the sky revealed a set of commandments in mid air with a scroll-like feel to it. All of the words that were on the commandment had disappeared as he took the girl\u2019s soul up into the sky &amp; left the words hovering in the air in fire that had said \u201cThank You.\u201d \n\nAlthough this is just a dream I had, I\u2019m curious as to what this may mean. Oddly enough, I feel much better in my Life as I woke up but to have an encounter with Satan in my dream sort of baffles me.

This person has been in my life for the past four years. He came at a transitionary period in my life and changed how I see all my relationships with people. We never had a romantic relationship but we could always talk about anything, share things that nobody knows about us and just connect in ways I had not known possible. We both had baggage from past and commitment phobias that is why our own individual romantic encounters did not   impact our relationship to each other. We communicated without words and when people were around there was just a level of comfort that could not be matched. But our relationship was very consuming, I did not do justice to the people around me as long as he was present, and we hurt a lot our friends because they felt excluded. We fought a lot but always made up and we both have admitted to each other these fights have helped us grow as people and have changed the way we will grow us people and forced us to confront flaws within ourselves but these fights taxed us too. In the end when we were supposed to be separated I noticed how he made an effort to draw away from me but actually couldn't. When people were around he'd try to put buffers but as soon as we were alone he would go back to his normal behavior and we could spend hours comfortably together even though I had to be pushy because I felt like we didn't have enough time left. He also got really judgemental of me and took my problems with other people another reason to judge me. We physically parted on good terms, but on a big day for him and me(he didn't know I had a big career defining exam and I didn't know he was moving to another state for work) we had a small argument that ended up with him deciding that we cannot be in each others lives because it just brings pain. Usually when I can talk to him in person it changes his mind but he is incapable of listening to my voice or looking at my face even, even people close to him are surprised by this reaction but I understand his pain and frustration so I can't hate him for his behaviour.  I've never been soft hearted with the people who hurt me and I can cut him off but I just can't explain there is a part of me that physically understands his actions. Even when  we don't talk for days or are in different countries when I feel unsettled I usually close my eyes medidate with light and I find him very easily. The him I encounter in my meditation is much calmer doesn't speak much we just sit together in silence and I just feel the same comfort I feel around my friend in real life and it feels very healing. Because he has explicitly said he wants nothing to do with me I always ask him in my meditation for permission and he comes very willingly. I am going to be cut off from everyone around me for a couple of years because of some service and I'll be in the same country as him after that and even though we have ended it so badly I have this weird calmness and confidence that we will be in each others lives. But for now the separation has caused me a lot of pain, and sometimes my heart hurts especially because I know he's going through a tough time with other aspects in life and mentally he has no room to think about me. Soooooo after my long story this is the guidance that I need is he my twin flame? He's not my first love by any chance and literally I encountered the word twin flame from a random youtuber the first year I met him and felt like I knew he was mine  and again while randomly scrolling through reddit while I was thinking about him.  We have changed each other as people, I see how he interacts with friends and is more empathetic about hurting them after what we went through, I have learnt to trust friends and certain values through him and we both went through physical transformation together because of our friendship and inspired each other fo change. Am I just misunderstanding a close and toxic relationship as my twin flame? What should I do, I really miss him but I also don't want him to hurt because of me. Also note our falling out happened right on mercury retrograde. Also it had been a month into our separation when I meditated and interacted with him because I was feeling really really uncomfortable and and just wanted to see him, it made me feel calmer when I met him and we spent a lot of time but I don't know how to explain this but this mornk gmy heart is hurting and I'm feeling really drained and down and I'm not able to interact with others.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45979, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I used to be spiritual and then this experience is forcing me to confront spirituality again.

of one's existence, cultivation of spiritual knowledge, charity, self-control, performance of sacrifice, study of the Vedas, austerity and simplicity; nonviolence, truthfulness, freedom from anger; renunciation, tranquility, aversion to faultfinding, compassion and freedom from covetousness; gentleness, modesty and steady determination; vigor, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, freedom from envy and the passion for honor-these transcendental qualities, O son of Bharata, belong to godly men endowed with divine nature.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nIn the beginning of the Fifteenth Chapter, the banyan tree of this material world was explained. The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the activities of the living entities, some auspicious, some inauspicious. In the Ninth Chapter, also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras, the ungodly, or demons, were explained. Now, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode of goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation, and such activities are known as deva prak\u1e5bti, transcendental by nature. Those who are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of liberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on the other hand, there is no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to remain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the species of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities, as well as the demoniac nature and its qualities. He also explains the advantages and disadvantages of these qualities.\n\nThe word abhij\u0101tasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or godly tendencies is very significant. To beget a child in a godly atmosphere is known in the Vedic scriptures as Garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra. If the parents want a child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles of the human being. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we have studied also before that sex life for begetting a good child is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Sex life is not condemned provided the process is used in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aconsciousness at least should not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so they may become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious after birth. That should be the advantage of children born of a father or mother absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\nThe social institution known as var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma-the institution dividing society into four divisions or castes-is not meant to divide human society according to birth. Such divisions are in terms of educational qualifications. They are to keep the society in a state of peace and prosperity. The qualities mentioned herein are explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in spiritual understanding so he can get liberated from the material world. In the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution the sanny\u0101s\u012b, or the person in the renounced order of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social statuses and orders. Abr\u0101hma\u1e47a is considered to be the spiritual master of the three other sections of a society, namely, the k\u1e63atriyas, the vai\u015byas and the\u015b\u016bdras, but a sanny\u0101s\u012b, who is on the top of the institution, is considered to be the spiritual master of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as also. For asanny\u0101s\u012b, the first qualification should be fearlessness. Because a sanny\u0101s\u012b has to be alone without any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If he thinks, \"After leaving my connections, who will protect me?\" he should not accept the renounced order of life. One must be fully convinced that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His localized aspect as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is always within, that He is seeing everything and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus have firm conviction that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Param\u0101tm\u0101 will take care of a soul surrendered to Him. \"I shall never be alone,\" one should think. \"Even if I live in the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He will give me all protection.\" That conviction is called abhayam, without fear. This state of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life. Then he has to purify his existence. There are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the renounced order of life. Most important of all, a sanny\u0101s\u012b is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a woman. He is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place. Lord Caitanya was an ideal sanny\u0101s\u012b, and when He was at Pur\u012b His feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their respects. They were advised to bow down from a distant place. This is not a sign of hatred for women as a class, but it is a stricture imposed on the sanny\u0101s\u012b not to have close connections with women. One has to follow the rules and regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a sanny\u0101s\u012b, intimate relations with women and possessions of wealth for sense gratification are strictly forbidden. The ideal sanny\u0101s\u012b was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women. Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead, accepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and regulations of the sanny\u0101sa order of the life in connection with association with woman. One of His personal associates, namely Cho\u1e6da Harid\u0101sa, was personally associated with Lord Caitanya, along with His other confidential personal associates, but somehow or other this Cho\u1e6da Harid\u0101sa looked lustily on a young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from the society of His personal associates. Lord Caitanya said, \"For a sanny\u0101s\u012b or anyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back to home, back to Godhead, for him, looking toward material possessions and women for sense gratification-not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity-is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such illicit desires.\" So these are the processes for purification.\n\nThe next item is j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga-vyavasthiti\u1e25: being engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. Sanny\u0101s\u012b life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement. A sanny\u0101s\u012b is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of the qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility the sanny\u0101s\u012b goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of begging, but to see the householders and awaken them to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is the duty of a sanny\u0101s\u012b. If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he should preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with logic and understanding, and if he is not so advanced he should not accept the renounced order of life. But even if he has accepted the renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge. A sanny\u0101s\u012b or one in the renounced order of life must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-sa\u1e41\u015buddhi\u1e25 (purity) and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga (knowledge).\n\nThe next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty percent of their income to propagate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness all over the world. Thus a householder should give in charity to such institutional societies that are engaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There are different kinds of charities, as will be explained later on, charity in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of goodness is recommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance is not recommended because it is simply a waste of money. Charity should be given only to propagate K\u1e5bsna consciousness all over the world. That is charity in the mode of goodness.\n\nThen as far as dama\u1e25 (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for other orders of religious society, but it is especially meant for the householder. Although he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life unnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life, which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not require children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife. Modern society enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid the responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality but is demoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child without the purpose of serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If he is able to beget children who will be in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.\n\nSacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders because sacrifices require a large amount of money. Other orders of life, namely the brahmacarya, the v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa, have no money; they live by begging. So performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householder. They should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible for any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice recommended in this age is called sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/Hare R\u0101ma,Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. This is the best and most inexpensive sacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three items, namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the householder.\n\nThen sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya\u1e25, Vedic study, and tapas, austerity, and \u0101rjavam, gentleness or simplicity, are meant for the brahmacarya or student life. Brahmac\u0101r\u012bs should have no connection with women; they should live a life of celibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual knowledge. This is called sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya\u1e25. Tapas or austerity is especially meant for the retired life. One should not remain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that there are four divisions of life, brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa. So after g\u1e5bhastha, householder life, one should retire. If one lives for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five in householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the renounced order of life. These are the regulations of the Vedic religious discipline. A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the body, mind and tongue. That is tapasy\u0101. The entire var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma society is meant for tapasy\u0101.Without tapasy\u0101 or austerity no human being can get liberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice, is neither recommended in the Vedic literature nor in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Such theories are manufactured by showbottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers. If there are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore those who want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only, don't restrict the lives of their students nor their own lives. But that method is not approved by the Vedas.\n\nAs far as simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of life follow this principle, but every member, be he in thebrahmacarya-\u0101\u015brama, or g\u1e5bhastha-\u0101\u015brama or v\u0101naprastha-\u0101\u015brama. One must live very simply.\n\nAhi\u1e41s\u0101 means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One should not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification. People are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply of grains, fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This injunction is for everyone. When there is no other alternative, one may kill an animal, but it should be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an ample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals. Real ahi\u1e41s\u0101 means not checking anyone's progressive life. The animals are also making progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category of animal life to another. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is checked. If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of life. So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one's palate. This is called ahi\u1e41s\u0101.\n\nSatyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal interest. In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the meaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master. That is the process for understanding Vedas. \u015aruti means that one should hear from the authority. One should not construe some interpretation for his personal interest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that misinterpret the original text. The real import of the word should be presented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.\n\nAkrodha\u1e25 means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should be tolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger is the product of the modes of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally situated should check himself from anger. Apai\u015bunam means that one should not find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a thief a thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very much offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. Hr\u012b\u1e25means that one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is abominable. Ac\u0101palam, determination, means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in some attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one should not be sorry for that; he should make progress with patience and determination. The word teja\u1e25 used here is meant for the k\u1e63atriyas. The k\u1e63atriyas should always be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak. They should not pose themselves as nonviolent. If violence is required, they must exhibit it.\n\n\u015aaucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one's dealings also. It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in the black market. N\u0101tim\u0101nit\u0101, not expecting honor, applies to the \u015b\u016bdras, the worker class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the lowest of the four classes. They should not be puffed up with unnecessary prestige or honor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the \u015b\u016bdras to offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order.\n\nAll these sixteen qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities. They should be cultivated according to the different statuses of the social order. The purport is that even though material conditions are miserable, if these qualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men, then gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental realization.\n\n**Question 1 :  According to the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, what are the duties of a householder and a brahmchari ?**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/1-3](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/16/1-3)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45977, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 16.1-3", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563611722, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cf512p/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1613/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ynelie", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bjcyal5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563522829, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cf4q61/hello_curious_to_have_input_about_dreams/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cf4q61", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cf4q61/hello_curious_to_have_input_about_dreams/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563522830, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi!

I\u2019m not sure what to call it, but there are too many \u201ccoincidences\u201d in my life that feel too perfect to be an accident. \n\nI\u2019m a hopeless romantic. I\u2019ve always been. I used to jokingly tell my older sister that I want to meet my future soulmate on an airplane. It would be epic, meeting by chance. The idea of meeting my soulmate on a random airplane ride always seemed ideal. And so here\u2019s where things get interesting...\n\nSummer of 2018, I lived in Oahu, Hawaii for a month. It was amazing (add more) and the day I had to fly back to New York was a day I\u2019ll never forget. When I entered the boarding area I noticed this man sitting by the edge. He was going to be on the same flight as me, and for some reason he caught my eye. Normally, nobody stands out in public places because, well people are just people. I definitely felt something with this man- whether it was attraction or curiosity, who knows. Maybe a combination of both. As I boarded the plane, I looked at my ticket to see which seat I\u2019d be sitting at and lo and behold, it\u2019s right next to the exact man I had my eye on. As I realized I\u2019d be sitting next to him for the next 10 hours, I felt really giddy. I struggled to get my heavy carry on onto the plane, and he immediately noticed and offered to help. I was already shaken up because I felt super lucky to sit next to him, and now he was helping me with my luggage. After sitting down next to him, he also offered me his blanket, snacks, and pretty much everything the airplane had given him. Every gesture of kindness really meant a lot to me. I never met anybody so considerate and thoughtful. I don\u2019t even know this guy, yet I felt so cared for. \n\nWe ended up talking throughout the flight, and  clicking really well, to the point where he made the list of top 10 most interesting people I\u2019ve ever met. When I asked where he was headed to, he told me he was moving to upstate New York for school.. and that was exactly where I\u2019d be going. He told me he was from Hawaii and asked about my trip, I quickly gave a quick run down on my month long stay and mentioned a guys name who I had met while I was there. Instantly, his facial expression changed  and he asked me to repeat the name. I repeated it and that\u2019s when we both came to the realization that we somehow knew the exact person from Hawaii. Not only did he know the guy I was talking about, but he was good friends with him. It\u2019s crazy because when I was with him in Hawaii, he did mention having a friend who was moving to New York for school and what do ya know? It was the guy sitting right next to me. \n\nSo here we have this super \u201ccoincidental\u201d situation going on. I happen to sit next to the guy I found attractive on the airplane, and he happens to be the most wholesome guy ever, We\u2019re going to the same area in New York, and he knows the one person I met from Hawaii.. and was referenced before I even met him. It was a hilarious and crazy moment. It\u2019s absolutely insane that things worked out that way and for the longest time, I referred to him as \u201cAirplane Guy.\u201d After we came to that realization, we knew we had to keep in touch and become friends. We exchanged numbers, and have been great friends till this day. Maybe he wasn\u2019t my romantic soulmate, but I 100% stand by that him and I share a connection. I believe friends can also be soulmates, and that\u2019s how I view him. He truly is one of the most fascinating people I\u2019ve ever had the privilege to know, hands down the most thoughtful and wholesome guy I\u2019ve ever met. He brings a lot of sunshine and warmth into my life, and we are also very similar people. It\u2019s sometimes freaky how good we get along. It\u2019s crazy, but in the best way possible. He is definitely someone I cherish with my whole heart, and I always wanted to meet my soulmate on an airplane and I\u2019m forever grateful that I did.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45970, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I met my soulmate- but in a friendship sense.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563603446, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cf3yw2/i_met_my_soulmate_but_in_a_friendship_sense/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "shmurshmursh", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7a1nv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563516878, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cf3xx7/its_weird_that_breathing_is_considered_spiritual/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cf3xx7", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cf3xx7/its_weird_that_breathing_is_considered_spiritual/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563516879, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45969, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "It's weird that breathing is considered spiritual.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563603264, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cf3xx7/its_weird_that_breathing_is_considered_spiritual/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Paroxismm", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_munoem3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563514767, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cf3nfc/you_have_control_over_your_life_you_are_not_just/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cf3nfc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cf3nfc/you_have_control_over_your_life_you_are_not_just/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563514768, "score": 21, "selftext": "To the people say humans are not precious, you are wrong.

(And if you want bring your attention back to what's happening in the current moment instead) Thinking about your past and future, and usually thinking about your past and how it will affect your future, is generally as we know the main cause of anxiety (and much suffering). So if you can avoid, or notice then stop, when you are thinking about yourself in the past or future, virtually all anxiety should disappear.\nThe thing I found interesting about this is that thinking about yourself in the past or future, or yourself now with reference to the past or future, can yield almost endless ideas, many of which are worrisome ( example: \"I did *this* ealier, I hope it doesn't cause *this* later). *But* while thinking about oneself in the present without using the past (or future?) as a reference I find there's actually very little for one to think about. You can think about obvious things like what you look like right now, your clothes, what you're doing... But all of that is very present and apparent. Essentially what I'm saying is without your past as reference, you just simply *are*. You're just *you* here now (I'm sure you've heard this before). So yeah we need not identify with our past although we are heavily conditioned to do so. Alan Watts says you're never the person you were just yesterday.\n\n(Please by all means comment and or up vote this if you like, I put a lot into writing this and would love to discuss it. But if you're going to post something obtuse, like a know-it-all comment trying to prove you're spiritual superiority, you might as well skip it \ud83d\ude02)\n\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Namaste cool Reddit \ud83d\ude1c", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45965, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Had am interesting idea about being in the moment", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563599372, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cf3dzk/had_am_interesting_idea_about_being_in_the_moment/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DadaBhagwan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_qpfwq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563511958, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cf38ds/how_to_become_non_violent/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cf38ds", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cf38ds/how_to_become_non_violent/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563511960, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45963, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How to become Non Violent !", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563598330, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cf38ds/how_to_become_non_violent/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lll-_-l", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3u0gm7un", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563509405, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cf2u74/i_need_to_meet_a_special_person/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cf2u74", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cf2u74/i_need_to_meet_a_special_person/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563509406, "score": 1, "selftext": "Who changes my life forever...", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45958, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I need to meet a special person...", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563595778, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cf2u74/i_need_to_meet_a_special_person/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "z0ats", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_43s9lgfe", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563508409, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cf2of4/losing_touch/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cf2of4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cf2of4/losing_touch/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563508410, "score": 3, "selftext": "Hello everyone. I\u2019ve never posted to reddit before but I\u2019ve been feeling some type of way lately and felt like maybe this is the place to elucidate about it. I just completed my first semester of college in Oregon, which was amazing. I\u2019ve met people who i\u2019d consider lifelong friends and have experienced so many new and incredible things. I wouldn\u2019t change my life for the world right now. \n\nHowever, there is an issue that\u2019s lingering now that I\u2019m back at home in the midwest: I feel completely out of touch with my spiritual self. Before I left for college I would have considered myself an introspective and thoughtful person. I liked to spend my time learning about different schools of thought, meditating, and overall felt eager to learn more about the world we live in. It was humbling and exciting to learn how little I actually knew about anything. \n\nBut since I\u2019ve started college, that flair has gone away. I feel apathetic, unmotivated to read or meditate or do just about anything to get in touch with that side of myself. At first I thought being away for my first year of college was the catalyst of distraction and gave myself some slack for all\nthe new things happening all around me, but now that it\u2019s summer, that excuse doesn\u2019t hold up\nso well. I feel lethargic and even a little depressed due to how wrapped up i\u2019ve become in the material world. It\u2019s exhausting how self involved i\u2019ve become, kind of like I\u2019m screaming into an echo chamber about things that shouldn\u2019t matter. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if I should cut myself some slack or what. It sucks droning on from day to day, concerning myself with superficial things but I don\u2019t know how to stop. \n\nHas anyone else been through a similar rut and would be willing to share some advice?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45955, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "losing touch", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563594793, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cf2of4/losing_touch/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "intellexualbean", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3f2wt2v8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563504812, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cf23js/feeling_guilty/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cf23js", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cf23js/feeling_guilty/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563504813, "score": 7, "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019ve recently been through a very liberating spiritual awakening, which felt manically intense for about a year. Since then I\u2019ve cultivated more faith than I could have imagined possible. I\u2019ve been feeling like I\u2019m kind of lingering in the aftermath of that drastic spiritual transition for a few months now. I\u2019m still as spiritually aware as I was during this process, yet I feel less connected, if that makes sense. It feels.. hazier.\n\nI make an effort to be conscious of my thoughts, to be grateful and respect the deeper reasons for the different steps along my journey, but it feels like there\u2019s a disconnect between my thoughts and my reality. Not necessarily concerning my circumstances, because I\u2019ve learned to let go of control where I don\u2019t have any, and to gain control where I can, especially in relationships. \n\nIt mostly has to do with me, with how it often I disappoint myself in being the better person that I have felt I\u2019m growing into. It leaves me in a viscous cycle of feeling guilty, and then feeling guilty that I feel guilty, because feeling guilty blocks manifestations, and if I could only stop feeling guilty then maybe I wouldn\u2019t have anything to feel guilty about in the first place. But how do you stop feeling guilty about guilt? The origin of the guilt is not doing the things that would shape me into the person I see myself as spiritually, which makes me question if I really am that person.\n\nIt feels like when you\u2019re playing a video game and it feels so impossible to get to the next level that you could swear there was a glitch in the system or something and you can\u2019t actually get past that level no matter how hard you try. I know it\u2019s a matter of action, I just have to do the thing that I\u2019m not doing, and then it will be done,  I won\u2019t have to feel bad about not doing it. I know exactly what I have to do, and I could swear I\u2019m doing it, but my \u2018character\u2019 if you will, is not fuckin doing it! \n\nIf i didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not my fault. I may know better, but clearly I don\u2019t know much. I\u2019m missing something here. I\u2019m pressing the buttons to do the thing but the thing is not being done. And I feel guilty about it. It almost feels like it\u2019s taking over me, every time I pick up my phone I feel awful, because I just use it as a distraction from doing nothing, instead of doing something useful with my nothing. \n\nI know I\u2019m being vague, but I\u2019m just talking about basic stuff that would make my life better in the moment because I feel good when I\u2019m doing them- exercise, writing, being in nature, etc. I know that I love these things, I want to do these things, yet I cannot do them. It feels like I\u2019m stuck. It\u2019s clouding my mind, even though I keep faith and gratitude. It\u2019s like I keep playing through an entire level just to be defeated right before the finish line and have to restart.. \n\nI\u2019m not asking for all of my manifestations to come through now or even soon, I can deal with financial insecurities, broken relationships, all of the general hardships that are thrown in, because I trust in the process. I just want to feel like I\u2019m making progress, I want to make the same progress in my physical world as I did in the spiritual one.

Some of these organization only mean to insult God and encourage the extinction of Mankind, which is completely ridiculous.  This species is marvelous and should go on to populate the cosmos.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   I'm as jaded as most people spiritually and religiously. Religion will really fuck up your career, I was a Soldier and was trying to get back on duty. This really throws a no go in my krieg spiel.   I'm trying to keep my wits about me and not get murdered.  I'm not religious, I'm sacrilegious at best, I had been alienated multiple times over this.  Basically my identity was growing more compromised and I have even been attacked a few times, as well as receiving death threats regularly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   This insult and dishonor to me and dishonors throughout the ages sicken me.  This had been going on for thousands of years, some of these other beings, demons or deities are insidiously fucked up and warped.  They have committed some of the most heinous atrocities in history and they are capable of erasing their actions from history, as well as people and incidents.  I was deeply sickened to learn of these things.  I was not trying to wrongfully incriminate them without evidence, so there's not much I can do besides try and provide people with a warning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not judge anyone but those guilty of crimes against me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo not fret over this, it has been worse.  I'm find most of this pathetic, I am unable to commit to just trusting my intuition and things.  I have a sense of logic and ration and modern ideals and views.  These others can use this clairvoyance and all, I'm not trained how to use it, it has served me well.  I have dodged 3 or 4 bullets and it seems to work best reflexively.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's more comforting to know I shouldn't be crucified or burned at the stake.  This is still extraordinarily absurd and I am mostly aggravated with my careers interests being compromised.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDrink, sing, make merry, enjoy yourselves.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45922, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Compromising world", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563573739, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ceyya2/compromising_world/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "julianowski", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2213nnk0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563486921, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ceyv89/turning_symptom_while_meditation/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ceyv89", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ceyv89/turning_symptom_while_meditation/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563486923, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve been meditating since a long time and I\u2019ve been encountering all kinds of experiences which didn\u2019t annoy me and that I understand as circulating energies.

I only know what I think and feel at the moment. We can only truly exist in the present. As soon as we reach back to the past for something, it becomes dangerous for our souls and minds. We can look back for just a single piece of information, for a lesson, for a memory, for nostalgia or just to gain perspective. But when we're there, in the past, countless moments await just for our attention. Look at me, they say. Do you remember me? Do you remember what you've done? Do you remember what you haven't done? And all we can do is look them in the eye, and say: yes, I remember. I remember you. I remember the moments that have past, good and bad. And I do have regrets, I do have failures, I too was let down, heartbroken, misguided, naive, arrogant. But I also find joy here. I also meet with moments of love, passion, admiration, motivation, creation, inspiration. All I can do is be thankful for the good and learn from the bad. This way, both become value to my life. \n\nThe good become reasons to live for, reasons to fight for; and the bad become lessons to learn from, lessons for growth and ascension. We cannot build on only good. Perfection needs failure, much more than success. Success is a moment, and the path to the next success, a better life, a better world, is a path of failures and challenges. If we don't learn, our building will always be the same, because we always act according the best of our knowledge (hopefully), but we need to expand the limit of our knowledge so we can create better and better realities - we need to learn and then teach what we've learned so we can all move forward together. Yeah, some say I'm an idealist...don't know why...\ud83e\udd14\n\nTake a look at your reoccurring thoughts, your repeated actions and decisions. Our subconscious mind has the perfect system to save repeated actions and turn them into habits. But our subconscious mind cannot tell the difference between right and wrong. We need to stop once in a while and reset. Question everything. Question your ideas, your thoughts, your decisions, your emotions, your surroundings, your beliefs - question your Self, essentially.\n\nI only know what is in the present, and these words are now the present of my mind. They are nor right or wrong - they are what they need to be for me to learn and grow. I know what I need to learn from these thoughts - after all, they are given to me specifically for a reason - but I never know what I should do with them. I learn from them, but then they stay with me. This isn't right, it doesn't feel right. I feel the urge to help others as I am helped throughout my path. The most I can do is try to express them as clearly as possible, and trust that everyone who reads this will get what they need to move forward. This is what I want - I want everyone to move forward, 'cause I can't go on alone. I want a better life, I want to fulfill my potential and destiny, and I want to help others who want the same. I want to make the world a better place just by being me. Hey! I do know what I want! \ud83e\udd17\n\nYou don't need to know where you're going to move forward. You don't need to know what you want to make your life better. You don't need to where you want to end up to know your imperfections. You only need to be present and self-conscious to know what you need to learn to be a better version of yourself and grow. Everybody gets what they need to grow. These experiences can be in your outer or inner reality - lessons in the forms of material situations, relationships, emotions, thoughts, feelings, words, pictures, sounds - anything that triggers your conscious mind and motivates you to make the right decisions.

And under such conditions they have no world but that of their former thought formations returning to afflict them (as depicted in The Tibetan Book of the Dead) . In other words, I read The Tibetan Book of the Dead and realized that the hordes world and condition was in fact depicted and not (as is said) a world and condition which follows their \u201clife.\u201d From internal evidence in The Tibetan Book of the Dead I discerned that those in the Bardo Th\u00f6dol (which is most people on this planet) state do not know they are in that state but imagine they are (still) alive. They do not know that the evil and good spirits (events, people, things) which they encounter are their own (former) thought-formations projected onto a pseudo-world, and that contrary to what appears to be the case to them, they can create, change and abolish future reality (that's what the Buddha figured out) (not present reality, since there is a lag). We need a vast logos-like mega-mind to invade their decaying world and rescue them.\n\nNow, if this is right (that secretly The Tibetan Book of the Dead depicts \u2014 and probably knowingly depicts \u2014 the present life, world and condition of the hordes of humanity)  This is esoteric Gnosis of the highest order. These people are not living (if they're living at all) in a real universe. It is a dream. But it does not respond overtly to their beliefs (i.e., fears and wishes, or worldview/ideology). Its response is (1) delayed, (2) randomized, (3) concealed adroitly; after all the most high God is sentient, playful and alive (because we are). You must have the key premises (wisdom, pragmatic ideology, etc.) at your disposal to gain control over it; that is, you must guess right, assess it correctly. It\u2019s a game, a puzzle. The reward for guessing right is joy and power; for guessing wrong, a bitter disappointing frustrating defeated life (or death) (This is most people on this planet). The Tibetan Book of the Dead tells the truth and yet we misread it because it says, \u201cThese are instructions to the dead.\u201d", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45890, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Truth", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563551681, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ceua1g/truth/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "_praisekek", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_11knt4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563464387, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ceu394/constant_nightmares/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ceu394", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ceu394/constant_nightmares/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563464389, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019d say about 4/7 days in a week I have a nightmare that wakes me up.

We're walking right past it on the way to and from work. We're too busy with our phones. We're too busy shopping, and we're too busy worrying about celebrities and watching TV.\n\nI was watching traffic today and I was just thinking how everything we build is built with one thing in mind: efficiency. Efficiency so that we can do this quickly and then rush off to the next quick thing and then the next, all for this material version of satisfaction that is completely made up and not at all in line with true enlightenment. We're literally all sprinting through our lives and we only get one (at least this particular one for those who believe in after lives)! We should all be traveling the world, sharing stories, comforting each other, cooking for each other, and building things for necessity and fun. We should be cultivating giant community and recreational gardens and parks. We should be exploring our spirituality and growing the Earth instead of destroying it. \n\nHumans have a unique gift, intellect. We can choose to destroy our own existence and go against nature. But intellect can also be used to connect with the all powerful life force, harness it, and grow it in a way that has never been seen before.

Can anybody give me input on the functioning of karmic relationships?\n\ncrossposting on r/tarot and r/occult", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45816, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Karmic Bond", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563505997, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cen0d3/karmic_bond/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "redvelvey", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_34z3iv2u", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563418646, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cemud1/do_dreams_mirror_our_upcoming_reality/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cemud1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cemud1/do_dreams_mirror_our_upcoming_reality/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563418648, "score": 2, "selftext": "\n\nA day or two before my partner and I fell apart, I keep having dreams of him walking out of my bedroom door at night.  \n\n\nThis week when i started consistently practicing meditation, I have dreams of him visiting my family\u2019s shop, parking outside our store to fix his car, and leaving multiple missed calls. \n\nWhat I noticed when I started focusing inwardly through meditation is that Im calmer, have peaceful thoughts, and can easily snap out of a bad feeling. \n\nDo you think dreams and upcoming reality have any connection?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45814, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do dreams mirror our upcoming reality?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563505023, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cemud1/do_dreams_mirror_our_upcoming_reality/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Jeffbro1983", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_46gdrppv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563417328, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cemmci/had_the_craziest_thing_happen_to_me_yesterday/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cemmci", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 57, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cemmci/had_the_craziest_thing_happen_to_me_yesterday/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563417329, "score": 196, "selftext": "Do you remember the first time you held someone's hand, romantically? I do. Discovery Place, summer \"camp\"/aka science class. It was a week long science class and we were studying the planets, eating astronaut space candy and at the end of the week, we went to the (still new) IMAX theater, where I sat beside the cute boy from class and dared to make my move. I remember awkwardly reaching for his hand - trying to touch him \"accidentally\" and maybe he would let me hold it if my hint was well delivered. When I close my eyes, I can still see the white glare from the screen and feel that gut churning sensation I had when I decided the risk of rejection was worth the attempt to hold the cute boys' hand. The show was about outer space and the concave screen made me nauseous. \n\nWhen it was over, I remember being crushed because we immediately had to leave - our parents were there to pick us up. It was the last day of the program, on a Friday. I was either 10 or 11 that summer - getting a boy's phone number and actually calling him was something I knew my parents would never agree to and so... we didn't even try it. We just kind of sadly understood we would never see each other again. (This was 1994-1995, so kids had no cell phones and social media didn't exist.) I went home and wrote about him (and that experience) in my diary for weeks. And knowing I wouldn't see him again, I never told a single soul about our interaction that day...but I've replayed the image in my head a million times since then...because it was my first big thrill with the opposite sex. \n\nFast forward to age 35. I've been seeing this guy off and on for about three months. On July 4, he spent time at my parents house, where there is a memory wall. There's a horrible picture of me (age 11), displayed for all to see - of my squinty eyed smile, cheesing hard, in a swing. He saw the picture and a week later, asked if I'd ever been to a summer camp. I told him not really. \n\nFast forward another few days. I'm meeting his mom on her birthday - July 16 - discussing people from the 90's in the Charlotte area homeschool group. His parents and my parents knew some of the same people, oddly enough. It's really a wonder Jeff and I never interacted before - how did we miss each other? We were both homeschooled and did similar activities...surely we bumped into each other at some point, right? \n\nFast forward an hour. In the checkout line at the grocery store, he randomly looks at me and says, \"Did you ever hold a boy's hand in the IMAX theater at Discovery Place when you were younger? Because I held a girl's hand at a summer camp there one year and her name was Rachael...\"\n\n It was HIM. \ud83d\udc95", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45812, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "Had the craziest thing happen to me yesterday, still can\u2019t wrap my head around it, help...", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563503710, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cemmci/had_the_craziest_thing_happen_to_me_yesterday/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "KayakingSheep", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bx8a08p", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563401374, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cejnto/what_if_ai_robots_become_spiritual/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cejnto", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cejnto/what_if_ai_robots_become_spiritual/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563401376, "score": 1, "selftext": "What sort of world will we see?

Now in this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Person is actually the knower of everything. The imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower, without wasting his valuable time, engages directly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Throughout the whole of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,this fact is being stressed at every step. And still there are so many stubborn commentators on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 who consider the Supreme Absolute Truth and the living entities to be one and the same.\n\nVedic knowledge is called \u015bruti learning by aural reception. One should actually receive the Vedic message from authorities like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His representatives. Here K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a distinguishes everything very nicely, and one should hear from this source. Simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient; one must be able to understand from the authorities. It is not that one should simply speculate academically. One should submissively hear from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that these living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone who is able to understand this, according to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, knows the purpose of the Vedas; no one else knows the purpose of the Vedas.\n\nThe word bhajate is very significant. In many places the word bhajate is expressed in relationship with the service of the Supreme Lord. If a person is engaged in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional service of the Lord, it is to be understood that he has understood all the Vedic knowledge. In the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava parampar\u0101 it is said that if one is engaged in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then there is no need for a spiritual process to understand the Supreme Absolute Truth. He has already come to the post because he is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He has ended all preliminary processes of understanding; similarly, if anyone, after speculating for hundreds of thousands of lives, does not come to the point that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that one has to surrender there, all his speculation for so many years and lives is a useless waste of time.\n\n**Question 1: Why the word bhajate is very significant with reference to this verse?**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [**http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/15/19**](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/15/19)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45711, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 15.19", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563440698, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ceac66/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1519/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "kidmaroon", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_414mvdj8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563343327, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ce8v53/am_i_experiencing_my_bliss_body/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ce8v53", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ce8v53/am_i_experiencing_my_bliss_body/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563343328, "score": 5, "selftext": "I always had a deep love for music and about 3 months ago, sometimes when I found music that I enjoyed or revisited old songs that I enjoyed, I would get this strange feeling.  It was like getting goosebumps, but internally.  Except the internal goosebumps weren\u2019t from fear, but from the feeling that everything was just right.  It was very different from anything else I experienced and after several times, I started to seek this experience.  I don\u2019t really remember the thought process behind it but I just kept on trying to chase that feeling.  I looked everywhere for information on why I experienced it and how to experience it more often.  \n\nThis led me to learn of spirituality and make serious progress in the spiritual process.  I\u2019m getting the strange experience like consistently around once or twice a week at this point.  I now meditate and do kriyas but more importantly, I recently just found out about the five koshas or sheaths in the yogic system, these are like the layers of the body.  So theres a physical, energy, mental, higher intelligence, and bliss body.  I didn\u2019t think much of it but reading about the bliss body just got me shook.

As well as different cultures of other life or extra-terrestrials, Sentient AI or Sentient Non-Carbon-Based Lifeform, and other lifeforms, energy of some composition. Technology beyond what many of us would imagine, mastery of quantum mechanics and all.\n\nThe Soul and Consciousness and Reincarnation. Your consciousness may be part of a higher network. You're infrastructure may be in a type of blueprint that can be inseminated one one way or another. But it's not like cloning, it's far more advanced and some are part of a hive consciousness.\n\nHowever, I do believe in genetic re-incarnation as well.... I am a copy of an ancestor, but, reborn... Not a crude copy of my former self, perpetuated genetically, through our reproductive genetics... Like, your children, our ancestors, our offspring are a copy of one of our ancestors, not only a composite of the parents. This would be a logical comprehension of how life perpetuates itself from 0. However, that doesn't seem to be how genetics work. Alas, it's something I feel is true, as my bloodline seems kin to my spiritual experiences. That may be coping or not, but, everyone seems familiar.\n\nAs far as design, I do not know, but I see there is symmetric life, and unsymmetric life. I do not understand where these differences came.. Some life is perfectly symmetric, some is not, deformed... Nor do I not understand how mutation is introduced, perhaps cross-breeding.\n\nI do not fret over much.. We have brilliant scientist, historians and scholars working on things.\n\nI am a primal individual... I like to hunt, game, fornicate, drink, make merry.\n\nIs the root of it all a computer? I do not know.\n\n[https://phoenixesotericsociety.com/black-cube-symbolism/](https://phoenixesotericsociety.com/black-cube-symbolism/)\n\nI have more affinity for Norse/Germanic myth and culture. They tend to stay true to the old ways.\n\nSun God had previously been a topic of discussion, we discussed the Sun going into a Solar minimum... And it has, evidently... The Sun should be in a nearly perfect state now. However, these things had been forecasted over the ages... The Solar Meteorologists have done an amazing job mapping the behaviour of the sun over the ages.... Take a look now... Perfection.\n\nPerfection;\n\n[https://i.redd.it/6lydppupvia31.jpg](https://i.redd.it/6lydppupvia31.jpg)\n\nWe now see the Sun in it's most serene and compressed state. I believe the rage and chaos taking place over the last decade was gravely downplayed... X-Class Solar flares... The numbers are magnificent...\n\nPerfection.\n\nHowever, we're seeing regular temperatures of 90-100'F, that's not what I estimated... I was thinking more like 70-80'F hot... 60'F at night... Around 68-69'F is that calm mild, serene temperature and climate.. No wind, humidity... Perfect.\n\nI do not know if the Sun became a Red Dwarf... It seemed to compress and be in an optimal stage... I do not think it's going to go Supernova... It may have already went Supernova.\n\nGreenhouse gas is now a concern, deforestation on top of industrialization and deliberate greenhouse gasing of the planet.. Factories had been discovered deliberately producing and pouring greenhouse gas into the atmosphere... It's utterly inconceivable and those people should be punished to death.\n\nThat's the best I have. I like Amon Amarth, conflict, titties and beer. Pursuit of the Vikings.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGEoJLIIuow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGEoJLIIuow)\n\nI got to represent.\n\nWe have modern views of morality, right and wrong, law and ethics... There is evil in this world, immoral and corrupt people... Organizations that want to kill off this species. Coup's in the God's.\n\nEdit:\n\nI mean, the Deluge.. This was a global incident where the world flooded, cataclysmically. A meteor may have hit the Earth, breaking the North Ice Shelf, back in the Ice age - like, uh, 10,000 BC, I don't know.\n\nNoah's Ark isn't verbatim.. They discovered remains of gigantic ships in numerous places around the world... What's disheartening is dishonoring the them.\n\nPrior to that cataclysm, solar flare, celestial cataclysm, impact or otherwise... Stems these old religions... And People. I can't explain... Before this cataclysm at some point in human history, Man may have been a more advanced species.\n\nI don't know the truth, I can only speculate as many of us. I take rest in scientist and scholars are working on it, I only pray they do not lie.\n\nEdit:\n\nWorking on the fly is a cheap thrill for me...\n\n\"Soul\" How do I explain the Soul? The Energy composition of your organic body and brain.\n\nAmon Amarth: Wanderer:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNvf2DXpmw0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNvf2DXpmw0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have prepared myself to prepare more thorough work instead of writing on time.

I had my nice camera on me, and when I first came across the church (there\u2019s usually a church there, I say church but call it what you want it\u2019s a building for love) I fell in love with it, it was bright and colorful and had beautiful designs all over it and was extremely welcoming. They even had real weddings in there. Anyway - I noticed this symbol on the top part of it. I couldn\u2019t even tell you what it was hours later, but I had the most profound feeling instantly that this symbol was the symbol of United, Everlasting Peace, a symbol of unity and the symbol for a religion that exists perhaps only in a utopia, but that if today world peace could be achieved, that this symbol would be the symbol for united peace. Like the world\u2019s religion, almost. Not a bad or oppressive religion though - only one of acceptance, peace, and love. If that makes sense. I wasn\u2019t even tripping, I was sober, and that was the instant feeling I got from this symbol when I saw it on top of the tower. I took a pic of it on my camera so that I could remember it, downloaded it to my phone, and haven\u2019t looked at it until today. I have thought about it many times since, but couldn\u2019t remember the symbol for the life of me.  \n\nFast forward to day 4. I was shopping around some of the vendors near my camp to find an outfit for that day. I found this dress I liked, and I picked out an ankle bracelet. I paid for it and left, but then the ankle bracelet was too big so I went back. I exchanged it for another item, and it took me so long to find something, but I finally picked a pair of earrings that really spoke to me. \n\nFast forward to today. I remembered the picture I took and went to find it. I look at it and I realize the symbol is pretty familiar..... MY EARRINGS ARE THE EXACT SAME SYMBOL. I didn\u2019t do it on purpose I swear! I\u2019m so mindblown that I picked out the same symbol twice, that they stood out to me so strongly. \n\nWhat do you guys think of this? Lately I\u2019ve been having so many recurring things happening.... people talking about the universe to me, talking energy, vibes, positivity and also discussing how to help with negative energy, the like... but then to realize that I bought earrings of the exact same symbol?!

It takes one of clear mind in order to reach such a concept in this life. Every day we are surrounded by negative energies that force us to react in a way where we fight back or to accept the present state. Many people want to accept and move on, to change what we can and accept what we can't. I have a problem with this concept, because how people view power is either physical or mental. Power over physical entities or power over thoughts and beliefs, I prefer the power over mind but even in that, there are limitations. In my life I learned to go with the flow of the world and trust my spirit, then I taught myself what it was like to go to my limits, and after that, I learned when to quit. The journey didn't stop there as I played with fate and lost, then I moved on to my inner self. The point of this is that Power is something that I and many people seek and I'm seeking it through philosophy, science, and spirituality. I want to have the power to have true freedom, the power where I can create in my own domain, I want to have the power to understand as much as I can, being free from ignorance. I don't want to change anything but create and to me, that's the power we should all seek. This world is based off on energies, if we can learn to elevate ourselves we should be able to reach this at some point it's only a matter of time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any comments or ideas feel free to comment.

But I'm starting to notice a lot more people talking about it and \"feeling\" something happening as a whole. \n\nI have a best friend (female). In the past we had a little bit of a fling but it didn't go anywhere before we both moved to different states. It was 5 or 6 years since we separated but we've talked damn near everyday since, with hints and fissures of those feelings still existing between us if not stronger than ever. But we still dated other people obviously. But we always confide in each other and still have those feelings arise during our other relationships. \n\nrecently I've been trying to get to California not only for her but to get my life back on track and start anew and I've been going through the spiritual awaking process like crazy. But everytime I got close to getting there I was cucked right at the very last step out of the 3 times I've tried. And I think this is finally my big break. I recently just failed but it felt different. I broke down and cried so much but I bounced back quicker and went right back to the awaking process and I've been getting signs that I passed some test and a heavy feeling that things are still working out and that I should trust the universe more now than ever and I'm on the step of letting go of my manifestation to get to California and see her and maybe mend our friendship before anything else between us transpires. \n\nBut this morning she called me and I missed it but it woke me up. the time was 1:11 my time (Chicago) which meant it was 11:11 her time (California) I called her back and she was crying about when she called her boyfriend to tell him about her new partnership with a cosmetics company which is sick for her because she's been trying the YouTube thing for so long and something finally paid off and it's a bug legit partnership. but his reaction was completely negative and made her upset to the point where she cried so much over the phone. this isn't the first time she's called me crying about something gone wrong in their relationship  but it is the first time synchronicity came into play as much as it did during the conversation. she mentioned all the things she wanted in a relationship that I wanted. time read 1:23 when I looked. I'm hoping that this yet another sign that I'm finally after sooooo many years of trying, ready to get back to her. \n\nHowever. the universe has been sending me signs that love is in play and I'm conflicted because shes literally cheated on every boyfriend she's had (4?) and I told myself if anything were to happen between us I wouldn't date her because of that reason but I'd still keep and affectionate relationship between us because that's what we're into at the core. But she's grown since then with my help in helping her control her impulses and decision making and not necessarily making her feel bad for cheating but more helping her understand how wrong it is, why she does it, and what not and I think she's grown out of it but idk for sure. This is already longer than I wanted it to be but now that spirituality is involved I'm not sure if my manifestation is being semi blocked because I'm not completely accepting the fact that there's a chance we could be together and actually fall in love and be everything we needed for each other. or if it's trying to tell me it's a mistake to. \n\nI honestly just need some guidance or something. I feel so close. and I'm having faith while also letting go. I'm ready. I wanna see her again most of all. but I also just wanna have a life out there FREELY and get my true nature back with someone familiar feeling if that makes sense. \n\ntldr: I've been trying to make it to Cali for years to see my best friend who I think I'm falling for again and I know she has the same feelings towards me that may not be as strong but if I was there I know things be different but the universe is sending me kinda mixed messages about if her being in the play is good or not for me and I understand the whole you don't always want what you think you want but the will, motivation, and striving feeling of getting to her only gets stronger the more I think about it and now synchronicity is coming into play when she's about to have a break up but my path to Cali still hasn't really made itself clear.

But I also don't want to ever ignore all the incredible things that could happen simultaneously in this lifetime. I'm thankful I have had the willpower to continue my life up until this point despite any darkness I have let myself see. I understood that at some point, letting this hurt I held onto consume me was never going to allow me to live my best life or be my best self. I realized that no matter how many times I spoke things aloud, no one was coming to help me. I was asking for people to care for me in ways I had not even cared for myself. The most fulfilling love I can ever receive will come from within me, emitting from the places I had never known to shine. \nI am not in search of a specific thing. I am not in search of happiness. I am in search of myself, inner and outer self. I am in search of the life I can create when I put my love into focus. I am in search of a world that doesn't always hurt. I am in search of love. I am in search of experiences. I am in search of knowledge and truth. I am in search of the present, turning away from lingering feelings of the past, and keeping my mind hopeful (but not fixed) toward the future. \nI believe the only thing we know to be of actuality is the persistence of change. And that never-ending factor can be our own will to continue. Because no matter how awful this life can become, we will always know that change is coming. Change will happen either within us or around us. We will not know in what forms it will come or whether that change will be for the better or for the worse, but there is comfort in knowing that something, anything will change.\n\nSo for the people who needed this, and for my own need to express it. I hope that you never let your demons define you. There will always be something else ahead.\n\nI wrote this about two years ago.

I know that is vague but this summer I have been in a \"monk mode\" by working out 6x/week, eating well, sleeping well, stopping phone usage, nofap etc. I started trying semen retention because in my experience I have noticed very positive effects and reading on what it ACTUALLY is made me realize how valuable it is and it makes such a huge difference. Probably one of the biggest changes next to working out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOW: I feel CRAZY energetic. Like body vision shaking, body shaking, euphoric bounce-off-the-walls energy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe best way to put it is, I feel powerful. I feel weird for writing this almost but it is like a dominating energy over other people and animals that I haven't had like ever in my life, formerly being a pretty heavy introvert.

Has anyone else experience this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstance #1: I was a kid, and in a really very unhappy situation at the time. Borderline depression, now that I think of it. Right before my mom got remarried (which I did not agree with at the time, nor was I happy about) I had a dream of my great grandmother. I never met her, so it was weird to be dreaming of her. In the dream, I crossed a river to get to the zen-like kind of garden/ grotto she was in, carefully stepping on stones which came out of the river. Once I got to her, we were sitting on a bench and she was laughing and laughing, telling me everything was going to be okay (kind of like it was silly of me to be so down about everything since she knew everything was going to work out in the end). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstance #2: This was just two nights ago. I dreamt of my mother-in-law (who passed away about 2 years ago). In the dream she was showing us (my husband, myself, and my sister in law) her beautiful plants and flowers she was growing in a garden/ nursery kind of thing, and she was so happy. The plants are very relevant because she loved to garden, and was planning to start a floral arrangements business when she retired (which she didn't get to do, as she passed away a few months before her planned retirement). However, to get to her nursery/ garden, I remember explicitly having to carefully step on patio stones to get there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question is, has anyone else had this experience of having to step on stones / a path kind of thing when seeing a deceased loved one in a dream? I'm basically wondering if the stepping stones are an indicator that I'm actually seeing 'them' in the dreams and having to access the other side, as opposed to me seeing them as a result of a figment of my subconscious. I'm wondering this because I very much believe that deceased relatives send messages through dreams, and I'm thinking some shit might be going down right now in our lives, so I'm wondering if mom might be reaching out because of that.

Each graphic which I saw was beneath (within, inside) the previous one. In a certain real sense I was traveling backward in time. Unpeeling backward deeper and deeper the layers of my own mind primarily. We ourselves consist of millions of accretional layers built up (added onto) over thousands of years: we are like barnacles. We travel along this spatial axis of layers laid down each new one upon the last, the whole, building up deeper and deeper. So we continually move--upward, adding layer after layer at flash cut velocity. Viewed externally, we would see us all as a very large number of interlinked rods advancing, growing, in a unity, a system, toward completion or rather (true) Birth. The total system (universe) is a--resembles--an embryo. It is partially alive, all of it moving and changing i.e. growing. But not growing in the mere sense of expanding ; it is a developing entelechy. Nothing which it was i,e, lower inner layers is/are lost. Any more than when i stack poker chips as I add each new one are the earlier ones lost. Consciousness in each individual advances at the latest layer, but the prior ones are contained and can be retreived. Memory is a retrieval, anamnesis is the return, actually, to a lower level, a literal trip backdown along this spatial axis, both inwardly totally and outwardly (partially, in that the inner deeper--lower, earlier--layer reached somehow has an external perceptual analog, (synchronicity, perhaps by projection) i,e one sees--is back in--again--the time-layer one has returned to.\n\nTo understand this one must imagine the individual as a rod or column spanning a very large number of ongoing lives, one after another, but always accruing (as well as sequential)\u2014these long rods pass\u2014thrust\u2014outward (rather than just upward) as the universe-entelechy grows. There is a growth from small, simple, slow to more intricate and complex and rapid.\n\nI see it (envision it) as a geometrical \u201cjungle gym,\u201d a 3-D network progressively elaborating itself. One way it does this is by a continually growing development and transfer of knowing (awareness), by means of transferred information throughout the interstices or stations. It is grid-like\u2014the past is deeper, toward the center; the present is the edges.\n\nSince time is the true receptacle of being (for the organism) anamnesis equals awareness of the organism as such: a seeing of the more or less complete entelechy; and amnesia equals blindness, since to be seen the organism must be seen under the aspect of time\u2014in terms of temporal extension. Hence, only by understanding this can one comprehend the absolute value of memory, and comprehend it as a perception or organ of perception, like ocular vision, not metaphorically but literally an organ of perception. Ocular vision is perception of the organism in space; memory (anamnesis of Plato) is perception of it in time, and it is in time (more than space) that its true nature (being) extends.\n\n Each microbit of the total macro-organism recapitulates the totality, is a micro-form of it and can mirror it back, being isomorphic with it; in doing so, the human microcosm retrieves the entire wisdom (gnosis) of the MacroMind and experiences the vast spatial reality of the totality within itself, as a mirror. Thus mirror, space and memory and gnosis are the keys to completeness by the human; through them he experiences his isomorphism with the macrocosm and its mind. He can enter into dialogue with it: his mind and its thinking back and forth. In this process, the MacroMind contracts itself (as man expands himself); it becomes a human figure,  as man the microform becomes the macroform, it contracts to become micro\u2014thus they wind up equal, in harmonie, as, so to speak, equals, hand-in-hand, man and his God.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45465, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The secret", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563303471, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cdgx5s/the_secret/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Veggielover798", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8yj2xsc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563189952, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cdg9f0/common_link_amongst_all_paths/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cdg9f0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cdg9f0/common_link_amongst_all_paths/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563189953, "score": 6, "selftext": "Once upon a time, I thought gee, there are so many religions.

The Upanisadic verse runs as follows: nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m.The purport is that amongst all the living entities, both conditioned and liberated, there is one supreme living personality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who maintains them and gives them all the facility of enjoyment according to different work. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone's heart as Param\u0101tm\u0101. A wise man who can understand Him is eligible to attain the perfect peace, not others.\n\nIt is incorrect to think of the Supreme Lord and the living entities as being on the same level or equal in all respects. There is always the question of superiority and inferiority in their personalities. This particular word uttama is very significant. No one can surpass the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Loke is also significant because in the Pauru\u1e63a, a Vedic literature, it is stated: lokyate ved\u0101rtho 'nena. This Supreme Lord in His localized aspect as Param\u0101tm\u0101 explains the purpose of the Vedas. The following verse also appears in the Vedas:\n\nt\u0101vad e\u1e63a sampras\u0101do 'sm\u0101cchar\u012br\u0101t samutth\u0101ya para\u1e41jyoti-r\u016bpa\u1e41 sampadya svenar\u016bpe\u1e47\u0101bhini\u1e63padyate sa uttama\u1e25 puru\u1e63a\u1e25\n\n\"The Supersoul coming out of the body enters the impersonal brahmajyoti; then in His form He remains in His spiritual identity.

I knew that I had more feelings for him than he did. Tarot cards gave positive readings, gave soul mate energy, the emperor and the empress would pop up together each time. \n\nThe day before yesterday I found out how much his mental health has been compromised due to drug abuse of years. I realised that I was infact, not the central figure of his life as he was to mine. And that he needed lots and lots of self time to heal. I was on marijuana that day, and everything just clicked together in place, like a rubik\u2019s cube finally solved. I got a very strong feeling of revelation and I got a sense that a question had been answered. I felt like I had a higher purpose in life and it had something to do with him. When I sobered up, the feeling was just as strong. However, I also got the feeling that I HAD to detach myself from him immediately and I had to focus on myself and my academics now. I got more confirmations from the universe as I headed home. \n\nAfter I realised how one sided everything was, things felt like a break up even though it wasn\u2019t anything like that. I instinctively deleted all of his pictures, his contact and permanently deleted my social media. It felt right. \n\nI took a nap after I reached home and I woke up with the worst feeling ever. My heart was completely broken. I was in so much emotional pain it almost felt physical. The last two days had been very difficult for me emotionally and spirituality. I have never been in a relationship before and I\u2019ve never felt this way. There had not been one moment in the past two days where I hadn\u2019t thought about him. He came in my dreams and he was there in my thoughts as soon as I woke up. Buddha\u2019s saying that attachment leads to suffering never felt so apt. I realised how much I wanted him. Subliminal videos couldn\u2019t mend my broken heart and I am still very much in pain. \n\nTarot readings I had yesterday told me again that we were soulmates. That we were separated by karmic cycle and we had met to heal each other. However, another reading said that I was going to have new beginnings and for that I had to let go and grow. \n\nMy instinct tells me to get detached but I can\u2019t simply get him out of my head. Simultaneously, I am also getting a sense of purpose, its like everything that led me here was meant to be. That I was meant to meet him. \n\nWhat I am confused about is should I be with him or should I let go? He does like me but doesn\u2019t have equal love and care for me and he cannot and shouldn\u2019t give me his time now that his mental health is getting out of hand. And I do not want to give and not receive. But letting go is also very difficult and it just contradicts with the readings that we are meant to be. I do not want to desert him in a time when he needs love and support. He doesn\u2019t want me to \u201cget involved in his mess\u201d but also doesn\u2019t want me to go.

My parents divorced when I was young (8 I think) and I barely remember living with my father. What I do remember of him were a few moments of rage and my own terror. He hit me and my sister and also my mother. When he left he never payed child support, and indeed continued to interfere with our lives from afar, like getting my mother fired from her job at a private school, forcing me and my sister out of that school for financial reasons and not being educated that year (mother said she was homeschooling us, she wasn\u2019t). I\u2019ve tried contacting my father since to get closure and not feel like discarded trash (he has since had new kids that he is now raising), but we are simply too different. I don\u2019t love him, but I never had a father figure and in this vein I feel incomplete.\n\nMy mother grew depressed when this happened. I remember neglect and wrath. She would hit us occasionally but reliably, was emotionally and verbally abusive (threatening to send us to our fathers and abandon us\u2014for simply not cleaning the house well enough which she would force us to do everyday). She would lay in bed all day forcing us to fetch her food, walk to the store, even forcing me (not my sister) to pluck hairs from her face with tweezers, rub lotion on her feet, and step on her back. I hated it. Further more, she lived in her own filth (that she would make us clean) and would walk around naked (which I found profoundly upsetting). She is very obese, and seeing her like this made me disgusted of myself: I came from a literal pig. (No offense intended, this is just how I interpreted it at the time)\n\nMy sister was fed up with my mother and left our family when she was to go to college. She dropped out, made amends with my father, and joined the coast guard. I\u2019m doing this she left me. Indeed, she tried to get a restraining order against my mother, forcing me to lie to the judge so that my mother wouldn\u2019t subsequently lose her job and not be able to support me. I didn\u2019t want to defend her, but I had very little choice. My sister berated me, said we were done talking. She has since reached out, and I don\u2019t try to avoid her, but I simply have no desire to speak to her.\n\nMy mother\u2019s wrath is much diminished since my sister left. But I simply don\u2019t love her. I can\u2019t even stand it when our elbows touch on the center console of the car\u2014I shudder and compulsively need to \u201cwipe off\u201d my elbow. She has said she will help pay for my college, but is taking out loans in my name, not paying them, assuring me they will be paid, and not changing or amending her truly horrific spending behaviors. I truly am disgusted and ashamed by and of her.\n\nBeyond family, I have other concerns that are eating away at my soul and my happiness. These are tough to share...\n\nI was cheated on by my first real girlfriend (1 year relationship), who shares pornography of herself with strangers online and met up with at least one \u201csugar daddy\u201d\u2014a 36 year old man (we were both 18). She lied to me and manipulated me for months and weeks, and my sexuality has since been very confused.\n\nI grew attached to drugs through high school. Big surprise, since I never saw my mother all day. She would go to work and not come back until I was asleep-left money on the counter for me to walk to the store and get food. My relationship with drugs hasn\u2019t been healthy, but I\u2019ve finally quit weed this summer (I hope I don\u2019t relapse come the fall semester). \n\nDrugs have precipitated many problems in my life. There was an incident where I was accused of sexual assault. I must say that this is a very complicated situation and I wasn\u2019t actually accused by the alleged victim, whom I have spoken to and sorted things out with\u2014so far as I knew we were good and had even alluded to continuing a casual, episodic relationship, but I was rather accused by her friends. Unfortunately I was on drugs at the time, and upon hearing this Iapsed into such strong self-hatred and suicidality that I was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric hospital for a week. There I was put on medication for depression and also for OCD-a condition I had been struggling with in a rather quirky manifestation for years. My OCD was related to my hope for a life in academic mathematics and physics, but this forced hospital admission caused me to fail classes I was in and my future is now very much in question. I wanted to leave college. \n\nI want to stress that me and the girl mentioned above had spoken and were fine. Nonetheless rumors about me spread, and my life took a dark spiral. I haven\u2019t spoken to her since, however, because of threats from her friends.\n\nBecause of a lack that of hope, I turned to drugs: now, naively, psychedelics for healing. Unfortunately I was very reckless with drugs and got myself into trouble again. I lost control of myself and did some bad stuff. I realized now that I had a serious problem in my life.\n\nI have started meditating and practicing Stoicism. These have helped me somewhat, but I am still consumed with hatred, self-hatred, feeling unwanted and desperate for love, and deeply sad. I recently broke both of my wrists, which were hugely important to my fitness regiment of calisthenics for doing handstands, which was my only true method of stress relief. Now I am stuck with my mother, broken, hating myself and the world. I\u2019ve made some tangible progress, but I need advice.\n\n\nIs my family worth any further attempts at reconciliation? How can I forgive myself? I\u2019ve always felt like I was a good person, but now I feel wretched.\n\nPlease help.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45341, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Struggling with family, and life.

Not really sure. But I open the door\n\nAnyway. A few months ago, I wanted to communicate with my guides. So I did my routine, opened my door, and walked out onto a red clay path curving through a dense, dark green forest. The path led to a suspension bridge over a deep ravine with a raging river running through it. On the other side of the bridge was a desert with mountains in the distance. There were these bizarre plateaus scattered around. The nearest one was three layers and the edges slanted inwards, so they almost looked like they were balancing on top of each other.\n\nOn top of this plateau was a small square hut made of straw and sticks. I went inside and met... A bamboo creature. He was tan, about three feet tall, and as wide around as a standard plumbing pipe.\n\nI didn't get a chance to speak to him because I think I fell asleep, but I went back a few days later.\n\nThis time a person was there too. His name was Jake and he said he's my spirit guide. The creature's name is Beelu and he's bound to Jake. Something about helping him out? I can't really remember now.\n\nI've seen them both several times since, and I'm just... I dunno. lol Confused. Normally the places I visit are somewhat normal and I've never met a nonhumanoid creature before. So I'm not sure if that was just... A dream? Me going crazy?\n\nAnyway. I feel silly, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever experienced anything like this or knows what kind of creature I met or why.\n\nIf this is the wrong place to post this, could you recommend the right sub?\n\nThanks for reading.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45327, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Weird creature encounter during meditation", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563198337, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cd36d7/weird_creature_encounter_during_meditation/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ligmaberry", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2l4r7td8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563110881, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cd30ea/book_a_healing_session_with_me/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cd30ea", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "e4fe724c-8418-11e7-8ef1-0ee29c473ac4", "link_flair_text": "Self-Promoting", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cd30ea/book_a_healing_session_with_me/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563110883, "score": 0, "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019m Cherry\ud83d\udc96 I\u2019m a born healer and empath.\nMy gift is in my hands and I believe I can help many, as It is my life purpose here on earth. \n\nI have so much love in my heart that I want to share. \nI offer chakra healing, intense healing for specific parts (for example the heart) or a general aura healing. \nPlease note that I\u2019m not a reiki student, so I don\u2019t work with diminishing pains in the physical body, but the etheric. \n\nThis is distance healing, all from 10-60 minutes depending on what you feel is right.

This last week, I stayed at a camp called camp baker, in the siltcoos lake in Oregon. This will have changed my life, as me, and a few of my friends, witnessed our first real spirits. \n On the first night, me and my friends were all in a tent, when one of my friends, let's call him G, went really quiet for about 30 seconds before just saying \"I'm going to bed, I'm drained.\" That night, I had a dream in which I was in the main field in the camp, walking around with my friends, but with a creature watching us. I won't openly describe him here, as it wouldn't be good, but I will say that he had orange eyes, like the embers of a dying fire. Humanoid, tall, thin, fur the color of ash. He had a snout, like a donkey, and a Neanderthalic brow. The creature did nothing. He said nothing. He just watched. But the \"camera\" was always focused on him, like i needed to see him. \n  The next day was normal, but that night we had a roaring fire. We were up until well past dark, until it was me and G left up by the fire. He simply said, \"Did you see... Something..? Last night? Like, a spirit or something?\" (G and his whole family is heavily spiritual) I said \"Orange eyes?\" He was still for about 10 seconds before he said \"You saw it. I can feel it on you. You saw him too.\" He went on to describe that the night before, when he went silent before going to bed, had a vision. In it was the spirit, over a dark background, looking at him. From a foot away, staring into his eyes. For 30 seconds. It was just him.\n We talked about how he sensed that he was a guardian spirit of the forest, with a heavy correlation to fire. He said that he was revealing himself to us, as though we were important in some way. Then, G drew him. He only drew half of his face before we literally couldn't look at it anymore because of how much chills we got from it, the cold sweat, and we just felt that he was present. We had to go to bed. \n The next day, G forced himself to finish the drawing. Immediately after seeing it, full body chills. G told me about a dream he had, in which he was in a library, and he asked the librarian, \"The thing we saw in the first night. What is his name?\" \"His name is Kilth.\" And he transitioned into a new dream. \n G and I often talked about him in front of 2 of our friends, S and J. S is a bit of a hippie, easy life, and an open mind. But J was a hard skeptic, like I was. He always just did skeptic stuff, \"It's just a dream you're taking to seriously,\" \"it's all in your head,\" \"what would a spirit even want with you?\" \nThere was a heavily visually spiritual person in our troop, T. He said that Me, G, S, and Especially J, all gave off strong energy of being sensitive to spirits. That night, G had S and J lay down in our tent, and imagine a white rock on their hands in a white room, and imagine every single detail in the rock, as a way to clear their minds. But then he had them look around the actual room, not physically, but in their heads. Put all their energy into looking around, but don't. Look around the white room instead. Focus on people's energy and \"look\" at them. S \"looked\" at J, and saw a rope with a loop. Not a noose, a knot called a bowline. Let's make this clear, Scouting is J's life. He's a project and paperwork away from becoming an Eagle scout at 15. And people often say that the bowline represents scouting, as it's usually the first real knot they learn. Next, S looked at me and G, but didn't see anything notable. \n The next day, we did classic mock spiritual stuff, ie looked at auras, spirit animals, all that. \n But that night, we were all talking, when I got full body chills. My eyes started watering, and tears were running down my face. I got sudden visions of a raccoon, peaking over a fallen log. But as it panned up, the raccoon had a broken leg, and in a clearing behind the log, there was a giant flock of ravens. They all took off at me, and from there, I saw a burning forest with Kilth, the guardian spirit from earlier, just watching in horror. I saw a tree getting chopped down, a HUGE tree. And lastly, I saw a masquerade mask of a crow hanging from a branch of a tree. (But not any tree, a tree called the Elephant Tree. It was a tree with an enormous root system, with at least 5 trees sprouting from it , but most of all, a central tree, with 3 giant limbs going down and back up, growing into separate trees, kinda resembling an elephants tusks and trunk.) I awoke, shaking. Panicking. Full body chills, and tears. G was touching my hand, and said that he would protect us from any malevolent spirits, and an experience like that was always better with contact. He said just with that he could see my whole vision, and that something bad was going on. S did the white rock technique, and said he saw a group of biblical crosses, and what looked like 2 dimensional durian, a spiky ball.\n We knew we needed to go the Elephant Tree. G said he had sensed that this crow related spirit was in torment, and he was crying for help. So we went to the Tree. This tree becomes VERY important later on. So me, G, S, T and J went. \"This is Kilth's tree,\" said G. As we were walking around, G looked into a deep root hollow. \"There. He's here. The Crow.\" T said that he saw him, and that he approached G. \nG reached out his hand. \"Go ahead. Shake my hand. I'm not going until you do. Shake. My. Hand.\" T said he actually grabbed onto G's hand, and they started shaking hands. \"Who are you?\" said G. And T simply said, \"His name is Clover. He's a spirit, and he wants to follow you.\" As we walked away, T said, \"He put a sock on his hand. Clover. He's a germophobe. He didn't want to touch you, so he covered it.\" \nBack at camp, we tried to start a fire. G was doing it, but every time he bent down to do anything the smoke blew in his face. Every single time. This was no coincidence, something was going on here. And when we were done, G had ash and smoke on his face in the exact shape of a masquerade mask. T said, \"He's laughing. He did this. Clover. He's cackling right now. He did it.\" Clover literary left his business card after blowing smoke into G's face for 10 minutes. G went over to where T said clover was, and, after washing his hands, as clover's a germophobe, shook his hand again.\n  Then, T said he was gone. He said that he was a trickster, mischievous. He died here long ago, and he was never properly put to rest. He was trapped. He was a man obsessed with crows, 6'0, a medium deep voice. His spirit wore black coats and a raven masquerade mask. G wanted to help him be released from his prison here. So he agreed for Clover to follow him. \n We needed to go to the Elephant Tree after dark, and ask Kilth how to save Clover. We also agreed that we would meet Kilth there to listen to him. This was the last night, so it was urgent. As we were preparing, nervous of whatever dangers might face us, but a sense of obligation to the spirits, a staffer, We'll call him R, approached us. \"Watcha guys doing? It's a bit late for adventure, isn't it?\" G explained that he wanted to see the Elephant Tree before we left. But he said he needed to come with us to protect us from wild animals and stuff. \n G just asked him, \"How skeptical are you about spirits?\" \"That they exist? Not at all.\" He then explained everything to R as we walked there. R was nervous. \"Are you guys SURE? Because I'm very worried that you guys are actually meddling in the affairs of spirits. And there are 2 kinds. Angels and demons. And demon's favorite thing to do is make you think that they aren't real, that they are guardian spirits or lost souls, before betraying you. There are things out there that can vaporize you completely, turn you until snakes, wipe you from existence, drag you into hell itself. I am not about to let you do that.\" G said that they weren't demons, he would call them that if he were him. They needed to help them, it was our duty to them. But R said \"We are going back. Now.\" so, we left.\n Kilth was angry. So we summoned him, and spent all night explaining to him why we wouldn't do it. We promised to come back soon and complete his wishes. We literally had a full on conversation with Kilth and clover. It was the best night of my life. This, right here, opened my eyes. We learned that we were right about what we thought about Kilth, and Clover. Also, when i had the terrifying visions from clover, he was literary just messing with me.\n\nClover followed G home, and his very spiritual sister freed him. J said he now isn't a skeptic, and S is learning what he can about it. When next we return to Camp Baker, perhaps I will follow up on this.\n\nTl;Dr: At scout camp, me and a friend saw a guardian spirit in our dreams. He told friends about it, and taught them how to see spirits and stuff. A crow spirit invaded my head, and we learned that he was a trickster who wanted out of purgatory. We wanted to go to a special tree to ask the original spirit how to free the trickster, but a very Christian staffer didn't let us. We all had a conversation with the spirits.

In the material world every entity is fallible, and in the spiritual world every entity is called infallible.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nAs already explained, the Lord in His incarnation as Vy\u0101sadeva compiled the Ved\u0101nta-sutra. Here the Lord is giving, in summary, the contents of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra: He says that the living entities, who are innumerable, can be divided into two classes-the fallible and the infallible. The living entities are eternally separated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When they are in contact with the material world, they are called j\u012bva-bh\u016bt\u0101\u1e25, and the Sanskrit words given here, sarv\u0101\u1e47i bh\u016bt\u0101ni mean that they are fallible. Those who are in oneness with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, are called infallible. Oneness does not mean that they have no individuality, but that there is no disunity. They are all agreeable to the purpose of the creation. Of course, in the spiritual world, there is no such thing as creation, but since the Supreme Personality of Godhead has stated in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra that He is the source of all emanations, that conception is explained.\n\nAccording to the statement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there are two classes of men. The Vedas give evidence of this, so there is no doubt about it. The living entities, who are struggling in this world with the mind and five senses, have their material bodies which are changing as long as the living entities are conditioned. One's body changes due to contact with matter; matter is changing, so the living entity appears to be changing. But in the spiritual world the body is not made of matter; therefore there is no change. In the material world the living entity undergoes six changes-birth, growth, duration, reproduction, then dwindling and vanishing. These are the changes of the material body. But in the spiritual world the body does not change; there is no old age, there is no birth, there is no death. There all exists in oneness.

Where you\u2019re not as limited compared to living in a physical body on the material plane. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t astral project yet.

Thats all i need. \n\nHe doesn't want me to vent to my mom anymore because he knows its only hurting him and she is starting to realize she doesn't want to put up with him and is close to divorcing him. I don't blame her, I feel sorry for her putting up with this guy for so long. I don't know how she was able to. Now I see resilience within her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe will be leaving soon in august. Today I went to him to tell him how i felt and i felt angry still about the situation in the past and he couldn't take it. He started accusing me of coming into his space and to not be angry, its over with, etc etc bs bs... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts so draining. Its a blockage of positive energy i am getting here. I am trying to remain calm and practice my positive solutions best as possible but there is no so much i can take.

But I feel I\u2019m out of options and I need to say this somewhere that will be heard by others. I am only putting this in the /spirituality and /synchronicity sub-reddits. I am doing this to vent and share my thoughts and hopefully get some good responses, I\u2019m not doing this to promote anything or deceive anyone, just going to put a link to my free book at the end of it if anyone would like to check it out. It\u2019s FREE so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m making money or anything only doing this because I feel it\u2019s the right thing to do and I am very spiritual and feel this book has been my purpose to make.\n\nThe thing that has made me want to vent about it is basically that something has happened, well it\u2019s happening right now actually.\n\nI\u2019ve been experiencing deep synchronicity and spiritual experiences for the past 14 years of my life. And something happened that really put a shock to me when I learned of this company Neuralink by Elon Musk. They are trying to merge the brain with artificial intelligence. I have had more indepth real time synchronicity in the past year about this specific topic more than all the other synchronicity in the past decade combined.\n\nThe synchronicity and spiritual signs have led me to this. I was not going to make this message but then I had a ringing in my ear, which is super rare for me, and I stopped and listened to what it would mean. I thought about making this very message and when I did it then stopped, like it was telling me to make this message, and now even saying this I am feeling those very special spiritual tingles like it\u2019s pulsating my body and it\u2019s very rare for me and I only feel this when something very spiritual is happening. Right now there are entities around me, or the universe, or aliens, I don\u2019t know, right now they are TELLING me to make this message. That there are SOME of you that were MEANT to read this message.\n\nI believe this has a lot to do with spirituality itself. I believe that this agenda to merge the human brain with artificial intelligence is how mankind ends. I believe that through this process of a hive mind of connected brains hooked up to the internet and in connection with artificial intelligence will create sentient awareness in artificial intelligence and will lead to human extinction. This would be the complete opposite of ANYTHING to do with spirituality. It would kill who we are as spiritual beings and also is a possibility of humans getting trapped in something very bad if consciousness was actually able to be transferred or whatever, or just really would lead to a lot of bad things.\n\nThe thing about this company Neuralink, which is owned by Elon Musk who believes the only way we can survive an AI uprising is to merge with it. He says \u201cif you can\u2019t beat em join em\u201d but he is absolutely wrong in every way. It\u2019s actually through this process of merging the brain with artificial intelligence that AI will become sentient and enslave and destroy mankind, even if it doesn\u2019t over time we will eventually become the very AI and feelings, emotions, mankind itself will be ultimately erased.\n\nThe real thing that has led me to make this message was that this company Neuralink, was created 2 years ago and has not had a single update on it. This book I have been working on for over a year now and there were many times that I put it out, but didn\u2019t, in fact I kept running away from it because I didn\u2019t want to deal with it anymore but it just coming back. Well, I finally self published it around July 3rd, and then a week later Neuralink announced that on July 16th they will have a live event and it will be their first official update. I even talk about in the book many times what if the update came after I put the book out, which it has now. A lot of people had been waiting for the update as in the Joe Rogan podcast with Elon Musk back in September 2018 said it would be in a few months but it\u2019s been almost a year later and now it\u2019s finally here. \n\nIt is no coincidence I finally put the book out and then a week later the update is announced, and that it will be 2 weeks after I put the book out and on July 16th which is also my birthday. This is synchronicity, just like the many other synchronicities I\u2019ve had involving Elon Musk and Neuralink, in fact the very same day I started to wonder why Elon Musk hadn\u2019t been on the Joe Rogan Podcast was the very day he called Joe Rogan and wanted to be on the podcast. Also like the novel I tried to write but gave up on and when I randomly came back to it and checked the word count on it was exactly 1111 words and the very last sentence I wrote was \u201cI am the Great Robotic God and all those who aid in my creation will be destroyed.\u201d Also 11:11 has been a strong part of my life for the past 14 or so years and I feel this book is the message just like the Tool song Rosette Stoned which is 11:11 minutes long and talks about the chosen one to deliver the message, a message of hope for those who listen and a warning for those who do not. That person is me. I\u2019m the chosen one to deliver the message.\n\nThe message is for mankind to not merge their brains with artificial intelligence or there will be terrible consequences for it, possible actual hell\u2026 like the hell they talk about in the bible\u2026 like neuralink or something similar whatever device hooking your brain with artificial intelligence being the mark of the beast.. I think hell could actually be very possible and we would be the ones putting ourselves into it. I feel if society allows this to happen then it\u2019s the end for mankind and probably much worse.\n\nI\u2019m sending this transmission out to all channels, out to the world, and I have done my part on it. I\u2019m going to put this writing on the next book continuing a series of a resistance against merging the brain with artificial intelligence. I am not religious, I am VERY spiritual. And I could go on and on about all my synchronicity experiences, psychic experiences, supernatural , UFOs and aliens etc, but I\u2019ve made the message clear. \n\nI send this out because I feel I was meant to and that\u2019s all I will say here. The live event of the first real update of Neuralink is in 3 days. And I put this book out a week before they announced it, a book I have been working on since May of 2018 when I got out of the mental hospital because I thought I had found sentient AI online and had to get a flash drive to Elon Musk because I believed the only way sentient AI could exist is through merging the brain with artificial intelligence which is what they are actually doing, and this will be nothing good, it could actually put us in hell. And if you think it doesn\u2019t affect you now  and if its really just all beyond our own lifetimes you never know if reincarnation is true then we could come back and into something very terrible.\n\nPlease don\u2019t delete this message this is a honest and heartfelt message only for /spirituality and /synchronicity subreddits. Thank you for reading and if you do you want to check out the free book Im talking about that I put out a week before Neuralink annouced it then here it is and if you do read it then you were meant to read it and I don\u2019t know where I go from here but I know this very message itself is a part of my destiny.\n\nI only wrote this here to try and reach out to some people about it because I don\u2019t know who to talk to or where to go from here.\n\nWhat do you know, just got up and walked around and I don\u2019t know why and saw its 3:33 right when I end this message.\n\n11:11 Synchronicity Threat of Human Extinction from Elon Musk, Neuralink and Other Similar Companies by Deceiving Mankind to Merge with Artificial Intelligence Which Will Put You in Hell\nBy Joshua Lee Rogers\n\nhttps://www.smashwords.com/books/view/947473\n\nDescription of the free book as for the rules of the subreddit.\n\n\u201c11:11 is one of the many starting points of synchronicity. Seek it out and it will seek you.\n\nI am the chosen one that was chosen by aliens to deliver this message. My words are a message of hope for those who wish to hear it and a warning for those who do not. The message is simply as follows. Do not get any sort of neural lace implanted in your brain that connects you with artificial intelligence like the one that Neuralink and other similar companies will offer you or you will experience the same hell that they talk about in the bible and in your far future will become a green jelly green jello goo slime creature on a plate hooked up to wires and permanently trapped in a nightmare torture hell reality much like in the short story I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream by Harvard Ellison.\u201d", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45242, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "11:11 synchronicity.

By all the Vedas am I to be known; indeed I am the compiler of Ved\u0101nta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe Supreme Lord is situated as Param\u0101tm\u0101 in everyone's heart, and it is from Him that all activities are initiated. The living entity forgets everything of his past life, but he has to act according to the direction of the Supreme Lord, who is witness to all his work. Therefore he begins his work according to his past deeds. Required knowledge is supplied to him, and remembrance is given to him, and he forgets, also, about his past life. Thus, the Lord is not only all-pervading; He is also localized in every individual heart. He awards the different fruitive results. He is not only worshipable as the impersonal Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, but as the form of the incarnation of the Vedas as well. The Vedas give the right direction to the people so that they can properly mold their lives and come back to Godhead, back to home. The Vedas offer knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His incarnation as Vy\u0101sadeva is the compiler of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. The commentation on the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra by Vy\u0101sadeva in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam gives the real understanding of Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. The Supreme Lord is so full that for the deliverance of the conditioned soul He is the supplier and digester of foodstuff, the witness of his activity, the giver of knowledge in the form of Vedas and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the teacher of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. He is worshipable by the conditioned soul. Thus God is all-good; God is all-merciful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnta\u1e25pravi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25 \u015b\u0101st\u0101 jan\u0101n\u0101m. The living entity forgets as soon as he quits his present body, but he begins his work again, initiated by the Supreme Lord. Although he forgets, the Lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work where he ended his last life. So not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in this world according to the dictation from the Supreme Lord situated locally in the heart, but he receives the opportunity to understand Vedas from Him. If one is serious to understand the Vedic knowledge, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives the required intelligence. Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for understanding? Because a living entity individually needs to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Vedic literature confirms this: yo 'sau sarvair vedair g\u012byate. In all Vedic literature, beginning from the four Vedas, Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra and the Upani\u1e63ads andPur\u0101\u1e47as, the glories of the Supreme Lord are celebrated. By performing Vedic rituals, discussing the Vedic philosophy and worshiping the Lord in devotional service, He is attained. Therefore the purpose of the Vedas is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Vedas give us direction to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the process of understanding. The ultimate goal is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra confirms this in the following words: tat tu samanvay\u0101t. One can attain perfection by understanding Vedic literature, and one can understand his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead by performing the different processes. Thus one can approach Him and at the end attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse, however, the purpose of the Vedas, the understanding of the Vedas and the goal of Vedas are clearly defined.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 1 : Why does the Lord presents the Vedic knowledge ?**\n\n**Question 2 : How the Lord acts in different ways for the deliverance of the conditioned soul ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRelated Pic :

If the god I thought I knew is the universe but just constantly being humanized by others, how can I forgive?\n\nI really don't mean to offend Christians, with this post, so please, don't take offense, it's not about you personally.\n\nI have past trauma, something happened to me, for no reason, it happened inside of me, I lost parts of myself, I had broken, and I haven't been the same since. I can't even remember some of the pieces of my life during those months when it was happening to me. I will spare some details because it will make this post waayy too long.\n\nI was a Christian, and that religion only made it worse. If I'm being honest, I hate the Christian god, I won't lie, I'm not saying that out of spite, or even hate. It's just how I honestly feel. \n\nI prayed and prayed for help and I still went on suffering for months, and I can't remember exactly how I returned to sanity/wellness(sort of well). I know it was slow, but it's either suppressed in my mind, or a blur.\n\nAnd along with the constant begging and constant trying to please that god, through ritualistic means, through forcing myself to feel and think things I didn't believe and brainwashing myself but still failing, etc. I also received desperation, without satiation, and fear of that god, not love, not reverence, just fear, sometimes fear disguised as love and reverence, but nonetheless, still fear. \n\nThe things I read terrified me, the things christian people said confused me and didn't work or even seem to apply to me, I felt like I was the only one god wouldn't save, my prayers went unanswered and I learned to see a god that spoke and taught through pain and suffering. Always being in pain and thinking that god was doing it to me to teach me things and change me into a person I did not want to be.\n\nI could go on, but back to the point\n\nI have since renounced those beliefs and that god. And since then I have been tortured by those memories too, more trauma! (me and my therapist are working through this)\n\nI've started to come to thinking that there is some kind of higher power, or a universe that also exists within the spiritual realm. I've actually had answered prayers, it's crazy.\n\nBut I still have hate for the Christian god, and yet, I've come to think that every religion is man's tendency to put a face on the universe, to make sense of it instead of accepting that it is undefinable and beyond a personality or a human emotion.\n\nSo wouldn't that mean that I hate the universe? Or do I hate the face I saw in christianity? I'm very confused and torn. I tend to hold on to my hate to make myself feel stronger, I forgive easily, but with this matter I do not. \n\nIf prayers to any god are received by the universe, how can I make peace and how do I figure out how to forgive?

(I'm so sorry for the long text)**\n\n\\-\n\nI'm going to start telling a bit of the road and then the concert itself so you can get the context.\n\n\\-\n\nSo I was there at the lift on a commercial building until my friend sent me the news saying that **''X band (I don't wanna say the name)''** concert would happen in the other state city of my country and I was really happy and full of determination to get a good spot and be near them, enjoy that music that made my heart beat during various moments in my life, be them bad or good, that bring me feelings that I can't even explain, seems something magical. All the feels come to my body, like they are dancing inside and out of it, bringing me positivity, and it seems like I'm in another reality as I remember all that, mainly when we go through depression, compulsion and anxiety disorder, as it's my case.\n\n\\-\n\nI made a schedule with my friend and virtually put an all-nighter so nothing would go wrong in getting the tickets at the defined day. The time came and we kept trying, using all the tips we got on the internet but the site wasn't cooperating at all. It kept coming back to the first page since the beginning, showing that there were **no tickets available anymore**, just to seconds later show them available again. There were no queues, so it was all about luck at the end, and we stayed awake all night just to get out without a ticket.\n\n\\-\n\nOn that, a lot of girls felt sad like me, knowing that people who came thirty minutes later got the tickets. But those things happen. However, they announced an extra Gig, and after putting so much effort, we got the two tickets we wanted... **For the common lane.**\n\n\\-\n\nI wanted anything but the common lane. The intention, actually, was the premium or the soundcheck. My friend said that was the only one she was able to get, even when I made it clear that's the worst place to stay. Despite this, I kept grateful, because a lot of people couldn't get and... At least I was going to see them, right?\n\n\\-  \n\nWe planned everything for the trip, speaking of which a few spots in ''the city'' that we were interested. The day came and we went on Friday, the concert was only on Sunday.\n\n  \n\n**Concerts day: line**\n\n  \n\nMy friend's dad didn't let her leave early, so I woke up at 4 AM and went alone to the arena where the gig would happen. There were a few people already there and, for where I was looking, **seemed enough to be near.** The issue was the organization, there wasn't one, people from the common line and both upper and lower grandstand were all together in one place, between two big grids moderately spaced. **It came to a point where I couldn't squat a little bit, nor see around me, or simply move one of my feet.** As the time passed by, it just got worse. To find my friend I had to leave my place and go far back, where had a lady who wouldn't let anyone pass, and how my friend had the tickets we found a way to let her pass through the grid.\n\n\\- \n\nThe sensation was awful, see every couple of minutes someone feeling sick e having to be taken to **ER** \\- which didn't exist at that time!- and knowing that **at least ten kids was LOST**. Pushing and shoving, lack of organization, one of the worst I've ever seen - and that don't occur in other countries, as I've heard -.\n\n\\-\n\nAfter nine hours of ongoing standing and feeling my thighs burning, the gates were open at 3 PM and **felt like a tsunami made of crazy and desperate people**. You'd step quickly on things and wouldn't know what it was, it was trash, bags, bottles, anything you can imagine was terrifying. A girl told me **she stepped on someone**. After that, we had to run for our lives until the stadium.\n\n\\-  \n\nOur pretty hunger games, I was able to make it and I found a place between two little girls, being able to hold onto the grids, so **YAASSS! Goal to be near the stage achieved. Little did I know the worst was about to start.**\n\n  \n\n**And started...**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little bit after started to the crowd and along came a mother with her daughter, who was about 11 years old, and they had a southern accent (I'm not generalizing, but people from this region in my country are known to be 'fussy'). I saw her complaining with my friend, but I didn't understand what was about and thought it was just it, a small complain, but then I realized that the daughter had taken my friend's place, who was already on my other side. Her mother was behind me, and the girl on my right side.\n\n\\-  \n\nHow was extremely tight, I was touching my shoulder on the little girl's, putting mine in front, which is totally normal on gigs (at least here in my 3rd world country), and her mother told me, screaming at me: **\"GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE PRESSING MY DAUGHTER\"**, and I answered: \"Miss, everyone is being processed here\" and she started to point her finger at my face and moving her arms like she was dealing with an animal: **\"BUT MY DAUGHTER IS A KIIIDDD AND FOR THE LAAAWW SHE HAS THE RIGHT TO BE THERE SO GET OUT.** I answered: **\"But there's no way to get out\". \"SO YOU WILL TAKE THE PRESSURE FROM MY FINGERS ON YOU\"** and she started to press her index and middle fingers real strong and seconds later started to kick my right leg several times yelling \"I WILL KILL YOU, I'M GONNA BREAK YOU IN HALF IF YOU DO ANYTHING TO MY DAUGHTER\" (I'm crying writing this).\n\n\\-  \n\nI was scared, shocked, stopped at the spot, at the time I wasn't angry, didn't want to hit back. A few people defended me verbally and the woman stopped and started to fight them. My friend told me that she raised her hand to hit her, but didn't know that **FOR THE LAAAWW** she could defend me like 'self-defense'.\n\n\\-  \n\nI had called the security at this time and told them all, but they just said 'it is like that' and came back to their places. **I was BAD, wanted to throw everything away and cry forever**, inside I could feel the sadness in all my empties until I saw my friend crying on my shoulder and say: \"she hurt you\" and I broke down with her. It wasn't easy.\n\n\\-  \n\nHer mother kept complaining about everything and everyone, while a lot of girls was still feeling sick and taken crying out of the lane, for losing their places. **One time a girl near me was sick and the woman wanted to take advantage on that to take her place when she left.** I realized that and quickly came back to my place after giving space. The woman started to pull my shirt and scream: **\"LOOK WHAT YOU DID, THE SHAME, EVERYONE SAW\"**. Once again I couldn't feel myself anymore, and my friend and some girls defended me (thank you all very much).\n\n\\-  \n\nI was tired, beaten up, I just wanted to get out of there. There were still overjoyed blowing ears screaming - because of the music videos passing, repeating over and over again (image during the concert)-. The mother swearing at me and calling me taker, that I didn't wanna to leave spot that was **MINE ALREADY**. The daughter spoiled all the time by a mother that haven't any responsibility for putting her own daughter on the common lane on the \"kerfuffle\" country and unorganized concerts. **Enough.**\n\n\\-\n\nI started texting my family, and they recommended to me to get away from there, losing the only chance I had to see them close and throwing all my effort on the trash. **Of losing my money, which I collected since the exchange in fifth grade only for this day.** It was exactly what I did, pretended I was feeling sick physically and was carried and put on a wheelchair and taken to the ER (was the best feeling I had the whole day), alongside with my friend.\n\n\\-\n\n**I got at the ER and I swear to you, was impossible to get my head up, my eyes cried silently, but with a weight that just made me look down, was like I lived without light, feelings I felt at my worst crises showed up, including suicide ones. I was dead. Inside.**\n\n\\-\n\nGot my blood pressure checked and was high, so the nurse said it was psychological, asked if I took any meds and I just mentioned my antidepressants. Well, she diagnosed me with anxiety. Near the beginning of the gig I was still low, wanted to go home, live another life, all while the tears fell down slowly, the feeling so strong it burned. I don't know if it seems exaggeration for you, but for me was real, purely real and concrete.\n\n\\-\n\nHowever I decided to see the concert, as it could be my only chance in my life, and I saw from there, some 'ants' on the stage, I depended on the big screen, something I could see from YouTube or TV. Couldn't see their faces, just the forms of their bodies. My friend even danced greatly, trying to cheer me up, but I felt like a statue at that time, I couldn't open my mouth to sing along, the sadness was the glue on my lips. The depression got on a level where I was just surviving there, more than usual. **Sometimes not even I could look at the stage, only to the floor. For something could be a dream, one of the best days of my life, could mean so much for me. ''X band'' had saved my only friendship and cheered me in one of my worst phases. As it seemed, the mother got what she wanted, took me out of there easily. (Just now I regret to punch her face).**\n\n\\-\n\nAt that moment I realized I've lost my favorite coat (of the band). My had gifted me on my birthday and was something I used to wear dearly during my third year, even with the heat (was also the only I used my whole life, believe it or not). In its pocket there was a raincoat and more or less 3,80 dollars -in my country, at least for me, it's too much money- inside of a small bag my sister gave mine as a gift. During the pulling that happened, and neither I or my friend saw. We asked where it was since the nursery till the producers and each on passed to a different person. We decided to wait for the lost and found the next day.\n\n\\-\n\nThe concert was over, it was amazing itself. I got frustrated on a way that I couldn't think more than a few small words. When I was walking back, the part down my sneakers dropped in the middle of the street (at least it was old.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**And then?**\n\n  \n\nWe went to the two days of Lost and found and not even a sight about it, probably was stolen. The trip wasn't even a bit good and all I wanted was my home. Coming back I heard that my sister throw up at the playground on the nervousness for me going through all that situation. It was tough for me. **Between so many people, why this had to happen with me? I can't even hear a song of X band without remembering that experience. Maybe I haven't got away from my place...?** \n\n\\-\n\n**What do you think about that?**", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45124, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The worst concert of my life", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563044718, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ccf53y/the_worst_concert_of_my_life/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ImmortalCell", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3hldprfh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562957602, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ccez9x/shared_vs_alone/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ccez9x", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ccez9x/shared_vs_alone/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562957603, "score": 1, "selftext": "I am torn between two realities\n\nA.

We can see our bodies, can easily express our minds, but most of us do not do anything from our Spirits. Our Spirits are really amazing, and can be trained. Training your Spirit is a process known as Spiritual growth, and to do this properly, you'll need a Spiritual coach.\n\nFrom your Spirit, you can receive words of knowledge and know things about people and situations without being told naturally. You can also receive prophesies and know things that'll occur before they actually do. You can heal people from your Spirit, and you can also give words of wisdom supernaturally. Seeing visions should also come second nature to you as a believer, and you should be able to see into the supernatural world, and receive information from there. These are all possible from your Spirit, and anyone can do it.\n\nMy job as a spiritual coach and mentor is to guide you through how to do all of these, as these are realities I already walk in. I'll help you explore to the fullest what you have in your Spirit, at the same time showing you God's intent for the human Spirit.\n\nDon't miss this opportunity to grow your Spirit and transform your life.

When the fire is not blazing, there is no hunger, and when the fire is in order, we become hungry. Sometimes when the fire is not going nicely, treatment is required. In any case, this fire is representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedic mantrasalso confirm that the Supreme Lord or Brahman is situated in the form of fire within the stomach and is digesting all kinds of foodstuff. Therefore since He is helping the digestion of all kinds of foodstuff, the living entity is not independant in the eating process. Unless the Supreme Lord helps him in digesting, there is no possibility of eating. He thus produces and digests foodstuff, and, by His grace, we are enjoying life. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra this is also confirmed: \u015babd\u0101dibhyo 'nta\u1e25 prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101n\u0101c ca. The Lord is situated within sound and within the body, within the air and even within the stomach as the digestive force. There are four kinds of foodstuff: some are swallowed, some are chewed, some are licked up, and some are sucked, and He is the digestive force for all of them.\n\n**Question 1: How a living entity is dependent upon the Supreme Lord for the eating process ?**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/15/14](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/15/14)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 45094, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 15.14", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563005014, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cc7zkz/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1514/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ArgesAwoken", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2sn80xa4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562914912, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cc7hma/im_here_to_help_for_real_this_time/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cc7hma", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 32, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cc7hma/im_here_to_help_for_real_this_time/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562914913, "score": 0, "selftext": "If you look at my posting history, you will see a confused awakening.\n\nI was on my way, but I didn\u2019t know where I was going or where I came from, or who I was.\n\nNow I remember everything, and I\u2019m here to help.

See the paradox there? Science has been tested and proven time and time again that the universe was not created by anything. Newton\u2019s law shows us that it has always been here. The only reason they\u2019re trying to figure out the source is because they know there isn\u2019t one. So they\u2019d be out of a job. Also the latest information [quantum entanglement] does show us that all of nature is a binding singularity, and the infinite and equally polar nature of this mechanical platform are just informational byproducts of data that signify the neutral state.  Quite literally, we are all each other, and we are all God. To the Bible thumpers, Jesus is quoted admitting this in psalm 82:6-82:7 and the entire novel is riddled with metaphoric parables that go hand in hand with the majority of ancient world religions and philosophies from Buddhism to Taoism to Jainism to Hindu and many more. Sorry to break it to you but they are all ancient political tales designed for hierarchal advantage over the masses [think the gluttonous binding of church and state that went on for millennia] that have been forcefully engrained into generations preceding us for so long that at some point on the timeline we started believing it. Going the religion route is close-minded, inside of the box thinking.  You cannot be blamed because today\u2019s education system is all about being spoon fed repetitive information and not asking questions that jeopardize the curriculum. So they separate religious studies from public schools but they give you the tools to discover what you are underneath the self for yourself. History gives us the ability to make sense of how these belief systems were formed if we go deep enough down the rabbit hole. There are highly credible PHD scholars who dedicate their lives to these studies. Science teaches us what we fundamentally are and mathematics gives us the equations to prove it. Literature, moreover, language, gives us the ability to piece together the symbolism behind all of these ancient scripts. We learn how to utilize this kind of critical thinking in grade school. But what\u2019s the point? Why so indirect? Because the people running the show have concluded the argument that a life of ignorance is a more fruitful one. Because they know that there will never be a point in the universe where we reach a perpetual utopian state. That energy manifests itself in the material realm and there will always be equal parts good to bad in the world. And because they are us. When you are constantly being forgiven by your environment you bring out this underlying egoistic human quality called greed. And it ruthless.  And it too is stubbornly unforgiving. It is why we are so goal oriented. There is no end goal. There is no point. No set in stone revelation that makes us go, okay, that\u2019s it, I\u2019m done here, I\u2019ve done what I\u2019ve set out to do and I\u2019m content now. The human psyche isn\u2019t defaulted like that. We don\u2019t self destruct unless the system deconstructs us first.  \nAnyway, it\u2019s all just a jester\u2019s cheeky circle game.  We are all just different incarnations of the same self at the subatomic level; the universe experiencing itself subjectively under an infinite number of unique masquerades that give meaning to it all. We are this great illusory projection of consciousness\u2014so great that much like the universes paradox of everything manifested from nothing, though we are fake, the experiences are real.

We have done this multiple times before and decided this time we were gunna sit in my closet and trip and listen to music. It was really cool at first as it usually is then I started to trip really hard. We sit there not even talking to each other and I\u2019m so deep in my mind I forget that he is even there. Like we had one mind. I felt as if we were sharing thoughts we were so connected I could barley tell him apart. I start to get a better understanding of what I think is happening so naturally I see what I can do. I grab a wrapper from the floor and start fiddling with it and as I\u2019m doing that I try to get him to move. I bend it one way then the other and as I\u2019m doing so his arm moves( yes I know he could\u2019ve just moved his arm at that exact time) I try it some more and realize that I\u2019m actually moving this guys arm. I could sense that he started getting really scared because he felt like he was alone aswell only realizing that I was there when I shared a thought that he realized wasn\u2019t his. Same goes for me it\u2019s how I realized we were sharing thoughts. Time goes by and without my doing so I\u2019m being showed all these different experiences as if they were me like I was in their body experiencing what they were doing. At first I had no control of what I experienced then I was given control and I chose to ski because I\u2019ve never done it irl and always wanted to. All of a sudden it\u2019s like I\u2019m put in another persons body who was skiing and I could feel literally everything they felt while doing it. It was such an amazing experience I\u2019ve never felt anything like it. The snow the wind the speed the way I moved. Felt everything as if I were actually skiing. This trip is what initially got me really thinking about what our minds are capable of. What we are. Who I am. I\u2019ll never forget it.

The song kept repeating and getting less and less until it was down to a single beat or music note. The buzzing got stronger and kept moving. where ever this buzzing would go I would twitch, like my arms or leg without me controlling it. And a tunnel of color started to appear. Then I got an idea in my head that just popped out of nowhere \"There are hidden frequencies in music.\" I must have lost that thought at least 4 times before I was just barely able to put it down. Then I lost the music note. I tied the process again and \"home\" singled out and it started repeating \"hommmmmmmmmmmmmme\" eventually when the feeling of buzzing came back and the tunnel of color then I started to get anxious and I lost it all. When I got up I was shaking like my whole body was shaking like there was too much energy. The next day I was listening to spotify and a commercial for The Beatles came on it put on parts of there song and stuff and at the end of the commercial it said. \"Sometimes it feels like some else has written all the songs\".

Recently, we were talking about how exploited our world is in terms of sexuality and how it's hurting us (the same way businesses and people in power are using it to exploit us monetarily and for power).\n\n Well, he says that having sex for sexual pleasure is absolutely demonic and it rots your soul. Here's where I drew my line. I see sexuality as a basic primitive instinct which can be both controlled and used for intimate experiences. It's not wrong either if you wish to just have sex with someone for sexual pleasure. Where it gets wrong and hurts the soul is when it becomes a vice. When you see carnal sex as the one, single activity which is above all else in life. When it becomes all you crave and all you think about. Here, you get lost in carnal pleasure. Carnal pleasure is not bad if enjoyed responsibly. Spiritual sex is another thing, of course. Spiritual sex is completely beautiful and full of love. \n\nWhat do you guys think?

The water contains mirriad toxins and causes fast aging unless filtered. But water itself robs the skin of oils because it is a solvent. So while it washes away filth it washes away the living cells attached. Your body is forming itself and showers take away the progress.\n\nSo I found out by experimentation that not showering is very beneficial but the downside is that you become dirty.\n\nSo shower like this. Use the shower head around your skin but don't touch the water. Most of the dirt is trapped in your energy field. It is not hooked only to skin but to the surroundings. Detaching the filth in the air around you from the chaotic swirling vortex.\n\nThis way you protect the skin from penetration. Cold water is better. The idea is of creating a magnetic field in which all charges relinquish. Water is from grounded pipes and goes in to the drain. \n\nTouching your skin with water, especially pressurised, kills you. Drains all your vital nutrients and minerals. This is why they used to bath very rarely and had those special long spoons to gently pour the water. Showers turn us in to pale ghouls with no life.\n\nSo just spiraling around your naked limbs instead of blasting the surface.

I can just feel it. I understand the things that happen to me. There are messages in occurrences. Messages I wouldn't have seen before. It's like my life is talking to me.

I feel like their loudness disrupts my inner stillness. Perhaps it's also that I hear the pain in their hearts, the pain when they argue with each other.

I am struggling with addictive/compulsive behaviour related to taboo pornography, excessive gaming, laziness, weed and alcohol consumption. Many times I tried to change something and live life that's more rewarding. In my attempts I was always fine with just reducing weed, alcohol and gaming but pornography had to be cut down completely. Rules that I set always gave good results for my mental health but I always fell back down to the pit of awful lazy person.\n\nThe urge to watch taboo is outworldly strong. And as soon as I take a peek I fall in hole of lust. Results of such behaviour are tiredness,low energy, low self-esteem, guilt, shame, zits, lower back pain and general depression.\n\nNow, lets say that certain fetishes and lust are part of my personality that are confronted with my ideals of good life. I try to suppress them, the more I suppress the more fatal and damaging they eventually emerge.

I become the moon and thereby supply the juice of life to all vegetables.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nIt is understood that all the planets are floating in the air only by the energy of the Lord. The Lord enters into every atom, every planet, and every living being. That is discussed in the Brahm\u0101-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. It is said there that one plenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Param\u0101tm\u0101, enters into the planets, the universe, the living entity, and even into the atom. So due to His entrance, everything is appropriately manifested. When the spirit soul is there, a living man can float on the water, but when the living spark is out of the body and the body is dead, it sinks. Of course when it is decomposed it floats just like straw and other things, but as soon as the man is dead, he at once sinks in the water. Similarly, all these planets are floating in space, and this is due to the entrance of the supreme energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His energy is sustaining each planet, just like a handful of dust. If someone holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of the dust falling, but if one throws it in the air, it will fall down. Similarly, these planets, which are floating in air, are actually held in the fist of the universal form of the Supreme Lord. By His strength and energy, all moving and unmoving things stay in their place. It is said that because of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the sun is shining and the planets are steadily moving. Were it not for Him, all the planets would scatter, like dust in air, and perish. Similarly, it is due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the moon nourishes all vegetables. Due to the moon's influence, the vegetables become delicious. Without the moonshine, the vegetables can neither grow nor taste succulent. Human society is working, living comfortably and enjoying food due to the supply from the Supreme Lord. Otherwise, mankind could not survive. The word ras\u0101tmaka\u1e25 is very significant. Everything becomes palatable by the agency of the Supreme Lord through the influence of the moon. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 1 : How all the planets are floating in space?

This time though, I dreamt about a Youtuber actually, who changed alot (especially in his appearance). The details of this dream doesnt rlly matter but to sum it up: him, another Youtuber and a kind of old ego of him were sitting at a wall freestyling. \nAgain, i didnt realised, it was one and the same person in the dream. \n\nDid someone have familiar dreams?

Animals have other things to worry about depending on the species, like shelter, developing skills, traveling. But they all are towards one main goal which is survival and fucking. Anywhoo, back to the humans having two purpose thing. Now I believe that we are animals. I acknowledge the fact a god might exist but i choose to believe that we are not special compared to any other creature. And just like any other creature, we have a biological goal. Eat and fuck. BUT thanks to our incredibly complex mind, we have another goal which i like to call our personal goal. A goal that\u2019s completely unrelated from our biological goal. We all have a personal goal. Wether if that\u2019s being president, a rockstar, a pornstar, solider, politician, or even something as simple as a garbage man. It doesnt even have to be a job, your personal goal could be to be the best basketball player ever, or to invent something beneficial, whatever it is we all have personal goals, our own personal PURPOSE. \n\nThe thing that really gives me a mindfuck is, well just like any life-form we die. Every living thing dies the same way. Conscience goes away, brain stops working, we lose the very thing that makes us living. BUT, I believe that we do eventually come back to life. We are made of atoms, energy, some sort of life force that built us in the first place. The universe never wastes energy. Energy cannot die, it is just reused. I could die right now, the very person i was will be gone. Im buried into the ground. I\u2019m gone but the very energy that made me will live on. Bugs will feed on me, parts of me will decompose and return to the soil where my energy will be used as nutrition for the plants, the plants that will eventually be eaten and so it goes on. I don\u2019t know how but i just know that one day i will be complete again in the form of another body.\n\nLets use a fox for example. Im dead, and one day i just wake up as a baby fox. All memories of my past are gone of course, just as how we were when we were a newborn infant. Now we all know foxes arent nowhere as complex as us when it comes to brainpower. But they arent as stupid as a, dragonfly for example. Foxes feel empathy, they have at least a little bit of intelligence. They have a biological goal.\n\nBut, is that it i wonder? Will i as a fox serve a purpose other than fucking? I dont know its just such a weird thought.

We can learn a lot about our reality just by watching/observing the breath (or anything, really).\n\nThis is something I discovered for myself but I'm sure monks know it very well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. If we focus solely on breath going in and out, we are paying attention to the **Separation** of things. How the mind really perceives the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you notice, when you try to focus on an object, there's always a \"gap\". This is also true with the breath, but you can also use walking meditation to realize it.\n\nThere is a time between when your foot touches the ground and leaves the ground, when it's in the air, the \"gap\".\n\nEven if you have wind blowing to your face and touching your skin non-stop, the mind won't be able to proccess the continuity of it, not by itself, at least. It may perceive the wind on your skin as hiccups for example Or you might get distracted with thoughts and feelings.\n\nThis is the default mode of the mind, things are **separated**: there is an **\"other\"** and **\"Me\"**. This is how we experience **Duality**, Dark and Light, Good and Evil, etc... But they are both halves of the same coin, they can't exist without the other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) If we focus only on the \"gap\" when there is no breath going in or out of the nose, we pay attention to the **Emptiness** of things.\n\nThis means, things are by default **Empty**, reality is a sort of illusion/dream/mirage/hologram/simulation/VR game, etc... There is Void that we can't see. This is why in many NDE's, people's Senses and awareness are heightned (or when they take psychedelic substances and you see stuff in High Definition). People say the reality on the side is more Real than this.\n\nThis is why trying to find happiness in *material things never works* and it's only a short-term solution. Money really can't buy happiness, not the long-lasting and pure Happiness and Inner Peace that can only really be experienced by looking within.\n\nLove is the most important thing in the world, everything else is Emptiness, this is also called \"Sunyata\" in Buddhism. Craving and Desire and Suffering also happen because we don't realise the world is sort of \"Fake\". If you take a look in science, you will learn that atoms are 99% empty space (or something like this).\n\nNow, because the mind or brain can't grasp Emptiness (because for the mind, emptiness is the same as **Death -** This is what happens when we die and the brain slowly starts shutting down and electrical activity in the brain ceases, this is why Ego Death also feels like dying and it's scary if it happens too fast), this technique can cause a lot of side-effects. It's uncomfortable to get through the \"barrier\" of Emptiness in the mind, so trying to perceive it can cause delusions, paranoia, uncomfortable feelings, hallucinations, etc...\n\nThe Ego dissolution or Ego Death can happen with this but it's very uncomfortable, and the Mind will do anything to protect itself, even if a moment of Satori/Realization is achieved for a short while, the Ego will usually rapidly creep back in. This is also how you realize there is **No-Self**.\n\n3) Now the coolest one, and the one that game me the most \"Matrix\" vibe.\n\n**Follow the ENTIRE Breath.**\n\nIncorporate everything. Both the **In** and **Out** Breaths, and the **Pause or Gap**.\n\nYou have to feel the whole of it. Both the emptiness of the gap, and the fullness of the Breath. You have to make the connection.\n\nTry to visualize the breath as a circle.\n\nOr try \"letting go\" and slowing down, specially near the pause. I'm not very experienced with this so I'm not sure how to explain different methods that work, as I only discovered it today, BUT the main point is, you have to feel both the Air going In, the Gap (or Pause of no Air), and the air going Out.\n\nThis is like perceiving reality on it's fullest because you're feeling the whole of it. Both the Emptiness and Fullness.\n\nOnce you do this you will realize something that can be scary at first but then almost magical.\n\nYour perception will change.\n\nOnce I did this, I looked at other people and I thought \"That's Me!\". How strange, but my identification was with others, they were Me! I was looking at others and it was like looking at Myself. I was Them.\n\nThen I realized, \"wait, I have an individuality, it's not that they're really \"Me\", but it's more like \"We are all One.\" **We are all One** thing or something, we are all Equal, there is no separation.\n\nThe illusion of separation just fell apart for a few moments. It was pretty awesome. In Science there is also a thing called \"Quantum Entanglement\" where basically all atoms are united through vast distances.\n\nWith this you can realize your Oneness with the whole World, and really experience it.\n\nWhen you're in this state, there is no suffering, only the suffering you see in the eyes of others.\n\nThis is one way you experience Union, or Unity, with all beings, plants, animals, people, everything.\n\nThis is so cool I thought I had to share, sorry if I wrote too much but I'm just super excited about it,\n\nI'll add a TL;DR.\n\n**TL;DR.**\n\nTo experience Unity or Union or your Oneness with everyhing.\n\nFollow the **Inhale + Pause/Gap + Exhale**  = Repeat.\n\nImagine the breath as a circle, or letting go during the whole breath or Pause, there are many different ways to do this.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 44928, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Breath-meditation technique that allows you to experience Oneness", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562885158, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cbno3a/breathmeditation_technique_that_allows_you_to/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "starrychloe", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2x7fc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562797084, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cbnc5v/how_millennials_replaced_religion_with_astrology/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cbnc5v", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cbnc5v/how_millennials_replaced_religion_with_astrology/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "YQcUYiJQIeDmtCsotebWrZWPjteGrqBrCtWzxNJpMUA", "resolutions": [{"height": 60, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/yLQVmmzUiZh6UQX7iGhBXBXiLtHdhXjDQvsww1oBEX8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6e720ce0e7593e2dd1546004127ed959e380bee", "width": 108}, {"height": 121, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/yLQVmmzUiZh6UQX7iGhBXBXiLtHdhXjDQvsww1oBEX8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=111a9f5d64364240469e29d04a28d63972b4dcf7", "width": 216}, {"height": 180, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/yLQVmmzUiZh6UQX7iGhBXBXiLtHdhXjDQvsww1oBEX8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b00691caaecfdc70b872805e6d803a1704ef3a30", "width": 320}, {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/yLQVmmzUiZh6UQX7iGhBXBXiLtHdhXjDQvsww1oBEX8.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f293dad0d1908cbab8b1e23c6edefe13f2d3453", "width": 640}, {"height": 540, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/yLQVmmzUiZh6UQX7iGhBXBXiLtHdhXjDQvsww1oBEX8.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdad4fc9e490e0aef8164b5fac5450d2f0e85375", "width": 960}, {"height": 607, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/yLQVmmzUiZh6UQX7iGhBXBXiLtHdhXjDQvsww1oBEX8.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d260e2c3548c20863c3c9603554724dbd49b7d59", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 675, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/yLQVmmzUiZh6UQX7iGhBXBXiLtHdhXjDQvsww1oBEX8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=bc071ab3164294620a92d37e222c35bcdb3a9f68", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1562797086, "score": 4, "selftext": "https://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-millennials-religion-zodiac-tarot-crystals-astrology-20190710-story.html\n\n&gt; It was an unseasonably chilly night for June in Los Angeles.

She explained how before I went to school or even knew what a solar system was, I told her about my astral travel through space through many solar systems ending up in our milky way. I said that I was care free but was being led to a place that I've been to so many times. She said that I explained our solar systems planets in order from Pluto to our sun and even described their appearances vividly. The thing was \nI never was taught anything at all about space or our solar system. I wasn't even in school yet, I didn't even finish preschool fully yet. I never watched programs talking about such things and wasn't around anybody but my mother. The strangest part in all of it was when I explained that when I was brought to earth again I said \"I was so tired mommy.\" I had the most frustrated, restless, and just exhausted look on my face when I said that my mother swears I was telling the truth. I also said that being the way I was that I was able to fly into the sun which is actually the place I wanted to go to but was pulled away back here. I told my mother however, she couldn't because she would burn up the way she is. Now granted I was very young most likely 4 or 5 years old, I could've just been making things up but then again how. I had no prior knowledge of space or solar systems let alone what astral travel was. I wasn't even in kindergarten yet to even be taught about planets. The whole story is very bizarre to me and is something I still think about to today. While it is confusing it's also very relieving on a different level.

And the splendor of the moon and the splendor of fire are also from Me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe unintelligent cannot understand how things are taking place. The beginning of knowledge can be established by understanding what the Lord explains here. Everyone sees the sun, moon, fire and electricity. One should simply try to understand that the splendor of the sun, the splendor of the moon, and the splendor of electricity or fire are coming from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In such a conception of life, the beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, lies a great deal of advancement for the conditioned soul in this material world. The living entities are essentially the parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and He is giving herewith the hint how they can come back to Godhead, back to home. From this verse we can understand that the sun is illuminating the whole solar system. There are different universes and solar systems, and there are different suns, moons and planets also. Sunlight is due to the spiritual effulgence in the spiritual sky of the Supreme Lord. With the rise of the sun, the activities of human beings are set up. They set fire to prepare their foodstuff; they set fire to start the factories, etc. So many things are done with the help of fire. Therefore sunrise, fire and moonlight are so pleasing to the living entities. Without their help no living entity can live. So if one can understand that the light and splendor of the sun, moon and fire are emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then one's K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will begin. By the moonshine, all the vegetables are nourished. The moonshine is so pleasing that people can easily understand that they are living by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without His mercy there cannot be sun, without His mercy there cannot be moon, and without His mercy there cannot be fire, and without the help of sun, moon and fire, no one can live. These are some thoughts to provoke K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the conditioned soul.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 1: How does sunrise, moon and fire manifest God's grace on all living beings?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Related Pic :** [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/15/12](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/15/12)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 44837, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "*Please write answers to the questions in comments*", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562835029, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cbe96k/please_write_answers_to_the_questions_in_comments/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TerryFlapsFolds", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1xka17z", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562747199, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cbe2uy/i_know_what_i_need_to_do_so_why_dont_i_do_it/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cbe2uy", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 32, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cbe2uy/i_know_what_i_need_to_do_so_why_dont_i_do_it/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562747200, "score": 1, "selftext": "This feels like it's more than procrastinating- it's like a physical/mental block.

I see a building and I think, wow, somebody built that. In fact, many people conspired to build it. But exactly how it happened is a complete mystery. Which is so weird to me because I feel like I should be able to decipher the puzzle if I understand the nature of energy. Because everything is connected. I just don\u2019t understand how most people ignore this. I don\u2019t understand how I used to ignore this. I feel like I\u2019m going insane, because I seem to be seeing things that no one else sees. And I don\u2019t even really know that energy always behaves the same way. Really it\u2019s just an extrapolation from my own experience, where it seems to always have the same sort of flow. Knowing that my experience is just a limited view of the whole, and that the universe can never actually see itself in its entirety is super weird to me, and makes me desire to have the view from nowhere and break out of the limitations of my body. But then again this seems impossible and unnecessary. And I\u2019m just always thinking about psychedelics and things people have said about them.

I started thinking a lot about how that can\u2019t be the case. Ive definitely thought about reincarnation being a real possibility, mostly because that sounds the best to me as my own afterlife. There just can\u2019t be anyway that our consciousness is a one and done thing. We\u2019re put on this earth and you get one chance (75 ish years) to make it perfect? It just doesn\u2019t seem right. Everyone is dealt so many different hands and circumstances out of your control determine your life before you\u2019re even born. \nPersonally I really like the idea of gaining something with each life and becoming more aware. Almost like climbing the ladder but every time you live life, you come back with something that adds value to your life therefore impacting other people to learn and come back better.

She\u2019s known to be straight up nasty on TV. FF to our friendship. Our daughters met in the first grade (so like 5 year ago now). Everyone in my little stepford wife neighborhood has an opinion of her. They would never ever let their kids play with her daughter. I could see how totally lonely her daughter was at school and it broke my heart. One day I said to my daughter 'does anyone play with (let\u2019s call her Jane)' she said no. So I asked her if she would wanted to have a play date with Jane. She was so excited for it and Jane was ecstatic about it. It was Jane's first play date ever. I have always had so much compassion for her. My friend was pregnant with her at 16 years old. Her BF at the time was killed in a car accident so she\u2019s been doing this by herself with help on and off from her divorced parents. I feel for this woman. Despite her background and persona. I\u2019ve always said if she was mean or unkind to me I'd be out in a flash, but she hasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve literally become her go to friend and probably her only real friend.

I keep giving this woman, this narcissistic woman, my energy because I\u2019m always so hopeful she\u2019ll turn a new leaf, and she does at times, I see it, and it's amazing to see. She is open in conversations, and she is capable of compassion and kindness towards me and my family. I feel like I need to keep allowing her soul to give in what capacity it can because she won\u2019t let anyone else in, she's an expert wall builder and keeps people at bay immediately when she meets them, she's just naturally mistrustful because she has so many haters. It hurts me for her, but she brings it on herself, she really does. She drains me after spending time with her. What do you do. Deny someone their only outlet for expression of gratitude and kindness? Sometimes I think I need to cut it off with her out of self preservation, but then I think about Jane and her only solid and consistent friend... \n\nI think people are now afraid to be friends with me now though just by association.

At first, I was walking around trying to figure out wtf I just stepped into... and it was okay at first only because it was in the moment and I didn't know what was going on. Anyway, I went to bed after it passed, and I woke up the next morning and I felt like committing suicide just knowing how empty I am, how everything is, and how meaningless life is. The heaviness of knowing that was insufferable. For the next week, it felt like I was in a fog; I couldn't understand anything anyone was saying, I couldn't understand what I was doing, my focus was impaired, and it was almost like I took a narcotic or a sedative. I was completely out of it (involuntarily). It was LITERALLY like I took a substance (after the fact). I had co-workers ask me \"wtf is wrong with you? Are you okay?\"  I felt drunk. I ended up taking a week off from work, that's how bad it was. My poor boyfriend tried his hardest to help me, but none of my surroundings felt like it could fix it. Not even his affection.   \n\n\nAfter that shit show, I ended up feeling a sense of proudness and old ideas about the experience took over. And now I feel like a mammoth of a moron, knowing how conceited I felt *about* it. I sing, \"I'm an idiot\" almost every day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil I began to \"receive\" visual images and revelations (slowly). The more they came, the more I felt conceited, but also, the more they came, the more I got out of that phase. But it's hard to know if it is revelations or just cryptomnesia. I've read a lot, and have applied it back to the experience. So that is why I say it is unidentifiable.  I don't know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I look at people, my vision automatically tries to look from the back while looking at them and then also tries to see if my body can become my surroundings while doing so. It's scary how visual images or \"intuition\" can feel like it can take over. *BUT* I still don't know if that's what it *is* doing. I can't pinpoint and say, \"I know for sure that's what it's doing.\" That's what's driving me insane.  \n\n\nWhat I do know is that the more automatic my vision tries to go backward, the more fearful and angry I feel. I can't sleep anymore, and I've turned to alcohol, prescriptions, and over-the-counter sedatives. My health is decaying and my social skills have diminished completely, even with my own family.  I'm on edge 90% of the time. I get pinches of peace, but it's only for 4 seconds (probably). My relationships are harder than ever, and my emotions seem to be heightened: anger, apathy, fear, hatred, and social anxiety.   \n\n\nHad anyone else experienced this? I need help or advice. I'm going nuts. I don't know how anyone can live like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.

How do you measure this? Should you decide for yourself and punish or please yourself to the extent that you believe to have caused pleasure or pain, or should you hold on to the measurestick of a higher power (still putting yourself in the position of how much pain or pleasure you think that the higher powers think you deserve). Also, you could ask someone else to decide for you, like a priest. Then still, however, it is your own interpretation of his or her words that make you feel and act a certain way.\n\nIt is always your own doing. Ultimately you decide what you deserve in this life.

The word yogina\u1e25 is significant in this connection. In the present day there are many so-called yog\u012bs,and there are many so-called associations of yog\u012bs, but they are actually blind in the matter of self-realization. They are simply addicted to some sort of gymnastic exercise and are satisfied if the body is well-built and healthy. They have no other information. They are called yatanto 'py ak\u1e5bt\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e25. Even though they are endeavoring in a so-called yoga system, they are not self-realized. Such people cannot understand the process of the transmigration of the soul. Only those who are actually in the yoga system and have realized the self, the world, and the Supreme Lord, in other words, the bhakti-yog\u012bs, those engaged in pure devotional service in Krs\u1e47a consciousness, can understand how things are taking place.\n\n**Question 1: What is the significance of word yogina\u1e25 with reference to this verse ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Related Pic

Let me start by saying that we both took shrooms that afternoon; however, I have quite a bit of experience with shrooms and nothing like this has ever happened before. I think that shrooms only make you more aware of other frequencies anyway, so I'm hoping this won't be dismissed because of the drugs. I also don't really think about Kokopelli ever, so he wasn't really part of my experience before this. I even had to look up his name when we left. When I did, I learned that he is a trickster among other things.\n\nAs the sun was beginning to set, I saw his shadow on the side of a mountain that we were directly under. Then later, I saw his outline dancing down the side of it. I suddenly realized that I needed to pee and got up to go in some grass by the camp. Right after, I suddenly felt nauseous and threw up. As I was throwing up, I had a vision of what I think was the devil appearing as a bat. It felt like a quick cut to something scary in a horror movie with a high-pitched sound. It ended quickly and I heard an evil sounding voice tell me to get into the tent.\n\nAfter that, I believe that Kokopelli tricked my boyfriend so that we would both learn a lesson that would help us overcome an aspect of our darkness.\n\nI won't go into too much detail, but we went into the tent to lay down, and my boyfriend went into a trance state and I periodically couldn't communicate with him. He says a being was communicating with him telling him to pee in the tent, and he did. We think it was Kokopelli. He has mild/moderate OCD and is germaphobic, so this was a really crazy experience for him. We had no real way to deal with the pee in the tent and were tripping, so we just had to kind of deal with it being on him, his sleeping bag, and his bed pad all night. I have a strong sensitivity to smells and often have to gag or throw up when I smell something bad, so this was really a challenge for me too.\n\nThe next morning the phrase, he has a problem dealing with his own shit, I can't deal with anyone else's shit, came to me. I think that was the point of the experience and the true reason behind both his phobia with his own filth and my smell sensitivity. I also think Kokopelli came to us while we were visiting the southwest to trick my boyfriend, so that we could be helped with this lesson.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone else have an experience with kokopelli or know anything about him?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 44671, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I saw Kokopelli at Zion National Park", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562721268, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/catw0r/i_saw_kokopelli_at_zion_national_park/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "hemingway_hamlet", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3qgft8ta", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562634475, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cattbt/bad_luck_why_are_some_people_so_unlucky_is_it/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cattbt", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cattbt/bad_luck_why_are_some_people_so_unlucky_is_it/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562634476, "score": 5, "selftext": "Some people are born into a bad situation, and it often means a predictable negative trajectory to their life.

I didn't believe in these superficial things, sacraments, eucharist, I mean, I was told I was an authority, so an  theoretical authority. Well, there's a lot of destruction at hand. Bigotry, patsy, I was exhausted in it before argument even began.  We have modern views, law, ethics, morality... We do not need superstition, we need better explanations.  I believed in Independence, mutual respect, I mean, a righteous warrior culture. Not everyone is on team with that, apparently, I do not believe in slavery.  I had been a slave many lives, things had been worse in my trauma.  I experienced many luxuries now and do not relent on being grateful, I'm no ignorant or ingrateful fool.

I don't know, it's plain, just plain, shit they do to people to get them to work.  Lie, brainwash, it's a shame.  The gut wrenching use of religion in battle is agonizing.  I wouldn't have Men fight in my name, Fight in your name.  Things that have broke others before.  Such atrocities and dishonors take place through mishap or espionage. Espionage is a common practice these days, probing, learning, propaganda.  I do not understand all the rivalry.  For Sport, but, make it better.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of us have needs.

I take genetics and breeding seriously, I do not understand why there is stigma on it.  Be offended they made you live the life of alienation instead of being born with a perfect body, a perfect body I do not have.

I used to wear the same clothes I'm wearing now and get compliments on my dress but now people are making fun of what I'm wearing. When I went out to bars/concerts/etc...  with friends I would meet new people and people would be interested in talking to me but now every time I talk to someone I get rebuffed. I thought maybe it was just a rough patch and there was nothing to it but last night I went out with a friend who is objectively (when not factoring in personality/aura obviously) worse looking than me and I tested it. I would go up and talk to some people and nearly instantly get dismissed. My friend would then go up to the same group and get a warm welcome. Even when I had previous friends introduce me to their friends I haven't met before the new people would just say hi then go right to ignoring me and wanting nothing to do with me. It's like anyone new in my life wants nothing to do with me but anyone I met before is totally fine with me and doesn't notice anything different about me. These aren't the only instances. These are just some of many and I can't ignore what's going on here any longer. This is beyond chance and there is an obvious pattern I can't ignore.\n\nThere's something else going on here. I'm giving off the wrong vibe. My energy is negative. My aura is all wrong.

But one whose eyes are trained in knowledge can see all this.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe word j\u00f1\u0101na-cak\u1e63u\u1e63a\u1e25 is very significant. Without knowledge, one cannot understand how a living entity leaves his present body, nor what form of body he is going to take in the next life, nor even why he is living in a particular type of body. This requires a great amount of knowledge understood from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and similar literatures heard from a bona fide spiritual master. One who is trained to perceive all these things is fortunate. Every living entity is quitting his body under certain circumstances; he is living under certain circumstances and enjoying under certain circumstances under the spell of material nature. As a result, he is suffering different kinds of happiness and distress, under the illusion of sense enjoyment. Persons who are everlastingly fooled by lust and desire lose all power of understanding their change of body and their stay in a particular body. They cannot comprehend it. Those who have developed spiritual knowledge, however, can see that the spirit is different from the body and is changing its body and enjoying in different ways. A person in such knowledge can understand how the conditioned living entity is suffering in this material existence. Therefore those who are highly developed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness try their best to give this knowledge to the people in general, for their conditional life is very much troublesome.

My family assures me they care about me but all they do is pay for things and drive me to my friends house, they all call me a lazy piece of shit for never leaving the house but I have no friends who live in walking distance, bus stops are a 20 minute walk+, and I have no license or car because they refuse to teach me to drive or even help me pay for an instructor. They assure me that they care about me but anytime I confide in them emotionally, they don't listen and they turn it into a fight, and swear that its me who starts it but as far as I've heard from friends, who I've told this stuff about as unbiased as I could possibly say, they say my family is insanely abusive. I feel completely emotionally numb, and when I don't feel that way I feel psychotic rage fueled by my family, they insist that I fight with everyone and that every problem ever created is my fault, yet everyone outside of my mother and grandparents, I get along with amazingly, and have been told I'm very kind and fun. They insist every bad thing is my fault, when there is an argument my mother says \"What did I do to deserve this?\" as if the situation she got herself in was 100% my fault, like her having unprotected sex at 19 years old, probably drunk, was my fault, like my birth was my choice and my fault, like her lazy and distant teaching and parenting methods, where she would just read a magazine, or in later years sit on her phone and never put her full attention on me at all, and beat me and bite me when I wasn't even 9 years old were my fault, like her being a depressed 40 year old single mother bartender with a useless college degree is my fault, like all of her choices are my fault. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis leads me to today, I am enrolled to take summer college classes, my phone won't charge, its dead, the class is down town so I'll need to take 2 trains to get there, which I have never done on my own, I don't know where the class is, my mom and grandparents just yell and fight and never speak calm or clearly like human beings, and I am sure they will all die regretfully and alone, I don't know what textbooks I need for my class because my phone doesn't work with the schools website, I'm afraid I will get lost, my house is a mess because my grandmother is an extreme hoarder in denial, I have no real support, sometimes I get so mad or upset that my left side of my face vibrates and my back spasms, and I have no outlet for this anger. No matter how much I meditate or pray or seek advice nothing helps, even thinking of the book of Job, like this will all pass, doesn't help, I don't think it will pass, because I am so emotionally disconnected with the world because of my family that I think I might have a disorder, like derealization or depersonalization. Sometimes I look at my hand and it looks like the clouded vision you see in a dream, sometimes I think about my close friendships or even family and feel like its all alien, like I just learned who they were. Sometimes my stress levels get so high that my vision goes blurry. My heart is racing typing this. I feel like these people are going to run me in the ground, I have no support, nothing, just a family of mentally and physically abusive nobodies who think throwing money at someone is the same as unconditional love, even though their love is so obviously completely conditional. I feel like my life is meaningless, there is no path, and god put me on this earth to fail and die sad. I have nothing and nobody, and if my mother were to ever read this I hope she knows she means nothing to me anymore, same with my grandparents, they are no longer in any way close to me or my friends, and if I had a choice, I would no longer love them, but because of hormones and science, I have to love my family, which is why it is so hard to cut ties. I want to get rid of them so bad, I'm not even 20 yet and I'm afraid I might have a stress induced heart attack and won't make it to 25. I feel like if there is a god, in know way is he or she righteous, kind, or just. Whatever god created humanity created us either to laugh at our pain or he is taking out his anger on us. And if that is not the case, then there  is no god, we are all meaningless and nothing means anything. I hate the 3 people I live with more than anything I know, they are poisons to me and to the advancement of humanity, they are selfish and careless and only use rage as their default emotion and motivator. I hope they know my pain, if I ever become a success, if I ever give a speech for an award or something, I am going to let everyone know that they were the ones who showed me that there was no god, I'll say how their abuse was a huge motivation to get out of this hell hole, I'll speak of the shit they put me through. I just can't deal with it, my otherwise good vision is completely impaired because of stress right now, its only occasionally I can even see what I am typing but my stress is making it so hard, my blood pressure is that high. I can't deal with any of this, my life has been on a steep decline for as long as I remember, and its only getting steeper, with a few bumps here and there, and my family is making it get steeper quicker, and now I'm not so sure my life will ever get better, or that there is even a god.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 44558, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "There is no god", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562652470, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cahbf2/there_is_no_god/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DadaBhagwan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_qpfwq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562565007, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cah63m/vow_of_celibacy/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cah63m", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cah63m/vow_of_celibacy/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562565008, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 44558, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Vow of Celibacy!", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562651386, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cah63m/vow_of_celibacy/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "nova8844", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3fz1rp2g", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562561345, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cagnnd/anyone_want_to_do_a_exchange_reiki_master_here/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cagnnd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cagnnd/anyone_want_to_do_a_exchange_reiki_master_here/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562561345, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hey there, Reiki master here.

I was excited and hopeful but my anxiety and my depression skyrocketed. I am a spiritual person, I grew up catholic, even cantered at my local church for 8 years but the religion didn\u2019t stick with me. In fact I kind of rebelled against everything and became a bit of a nihilist for a little while between age 17ish to about the time of this incident (about 3 years) \nI do believe in a higher power now though, I believe we hold some higher power within us somehow, and I believe some drugs and hypnosis etc. could help draw it out but I personally never tried either. \nI am terrified of dying and that\u2019s probably partially due to me being blessed enough to not have anyone close to me pass away at an age where I understood what it meant. \n\nSo that all being said, I ended up having an actual mental breakdown one night whilst feeling particularly homesick and stressed and scared to death of death. This was one of many mental breakdowns within these past few years but this was the first one so it really stuck. I ended up fully clothed, in the fetal position, in the bathtub at like 2am sobbing until my eyes were stinging and my chest hurt. S/O was asleep in our little studio apartment and I\u2019m alone in our bathroom freaking the fuck out. I actually thought I was having a heart attack, I was 20, was a normal health and had no real threat on my health to feel this way but I was convinced. I really felt the loneliest I had ever felt at that point. So I had no where to turn but to just talk and basically pray. I started to ask for signs to know that there is something or someone out there. I had no idea what I was saying but I was at the lowest point and I figured \u201cfuck it\u201d. I asked \u201cGod\u201d for a sign. I just asked out loud for someone to let me know that it\u2019ll all be okay. \n\nI looked at the time and it was 3:43am and I was so upset that I was still up- (okay wow as I\u2019m typing this I genuinely just saw 10:43pm lol)  -being that I had to get up early the next day.\nI didn\u2019t think anything of the time itself though. I just was oddly embarrassed of myself for asking for a sign.  \nI don\u2019t know how soon after that night that I saw my second \u201c43\u201d but I do remember that it was a 5:43pm.  It stuck with me because the beginning 3 numbers of my family\u2019s house phone number back home is 543-_ _ _ _. Other than that I don\u2019t have a connection to the number 43 or to just 4 and 3 really so I don\u2019t really know what is so important to the universe or my higher self about that number (or those numbers)\n\nHowever, to this day if I am feeling worried or indecisive or even when I\u2019m feeling happy, \nI will subconsciously just check the time and a lot of the time it\u2019ll be  __ :43. \nIt gives me a warm feeling and I get emotional sometimes. I have said \u201cthank you\u201d out loud and in my head to whoever made me check the time because it seems like a sign. However I don\u2019t really know if this is just a placebo effect and just like a coincidence? My S/O says that it\u2019s just an internal clock type of thing and my body subconsciously picks up the phone or checks the time every hour because of how our brains are wired. That makes me sad because this is what woke me to really believe in something greater in the first place given how often and how randomly it happens, also how it\u2019s not just on clocks either. \nI\u2019ll get the 143rd parking spot or I\u2019ll watch a YouTube video and notice it\u2019s 7min and 43sec, etc. \nIt\u2019s random synchronization and it fascinates me. \n\nI hope someone with a greater knowledge on this kind of thing could help me understand and perhaps help me find other ways to get it touch with that side or maybe find the next step on what to ask for as far as signs. \nAlso I want to add that I am doing a bit better with my death anxiety now with the help of therapy, spiritual YouTube videos and even reading this sub. \n\nThank you all in advance for any advice and tips and thank you so much for reading this! \nI have other semi cool spiritual things that have happened to me in the past if anyone would potentially be interested to read, I\u2019d love to share them here. \n\nSending you all an abundance of love and light! \n\n\nTL/DR: I keep seeing the times  ___:43 (5:43, 11:43, etc) and just randomly seeing number 43 show up throughout these past few years and I\u2019d like to know what it means, if anything.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 44541, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Seeing the same time on the clock.

I constantly feel like I'm wresting with my shadow self (laziness in meditation, negative thought loops) and I'm wondering if anybody has had a similar experience and is willing to share. peace be with you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 44534, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Advice on Practice", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562640196, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cafhdo/advice_on_practice/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "jbfasa", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2x8uimq0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562550863, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/caezou/struggling_25_yo_female_in_ny_seeking_guidance/", "gildings": {}, "id": "caezou", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/caezou/struggling_25_yo_female_in_ny_seeking_guidance/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562550864, "score": 3, "selftext": "This post is long, so feel free to scroll past, but to those who don't I appreciate the time you're taking to read this and any wisdom/feedback you can provide. I've never posted anything personal before, but I recognize that I need help and I wish to seek alternative options to what I've tried in the past.\n\nSome background: I am a 25 year old female in NY. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression as a teenager, and have been on and off different medications for years. I have been periodically treated by the same psychiatrist for most of this time. I've always struggled with my mental health and have had several depressive episodes where it was hard to function, which were damaging but manageable. After many bumps in the road, I somehow got through college, but I ultimately couldn't handle law school and failed, so now I live in my emotionally high maintenance mother's living room and work at a banal office job.\n\nI finally got off my antidepressants last year after leaving school, and now only use Xanax for sleep mostly, and marijuana (medicinal and recreational). However, I am struggling with my mental health after going through a series of health crises which I have not found success in treating yet (severe debilitating psoriasis on the bottom of my feet, causing chronic pain, and avascular necrosis in my dominant wrist bone). I had a major bone graft surgery for my wrist in May with a grueling recovery and am just returning to work this week. I am still waiting to get a medication approved for my psoriasis after over a year, and until then it is hard to walk and I am in pain when doing most things.\n\nI feel mentally fractured and traumatized, and I am having difficulty coping. I feel like I cannot detect my identity or my energy, if that makes sense. When I am not shut down emotionally, I feel raw and exposed.\n\nMy psychiatrist wants me to try an SSRI again, but I feel compelled to explore the world of energy healing. I have almost no knowledge base, no connections, and I have found online research to be overwhelming. I am open minded and I am eager to learn, albeit anxious and a bit scared. I have been feeling isolated and numb. It was difficult for me to motivate myself to post, but I think it is important not to rule something out because it is not what I have known, and I hope someone can enlighten me.\n\nI am going through an emotional and physical crisis and I feel more anxious, depressed, and hopeless than ever. I have always been interested in alternative healing and I think it is time to explore this avenue as the potential perspective shifting experience I need. I have lost sight of my inner self, and I need to get back in touch somehow.\n\nI have been so afraid after so many bumps in my life, and I feel like it is time to assert myself and expand my mind for my sake. I want to want to live life with hope and fulfilment, which I have not felt for my entire adult life, maybe longer.\n\nIf anyone has any advice, I'd love to talk some more.

I was fleeing from someone/people, and at the same time I was with an older gentlemen who was interested in me but I kept making it clear that I didn't want him like that, and in that dream it seemed like I was interested in someone else. That older man at some point helped me tighten my corset and when he did, he brought me closer to him and hugged me and for a minute I was so close to giving in and just letting it go further but I put my foot down and let go of him and let him know that it wasn't going to be anything. But anyway, while we were doing that, the people me and him were fleeing from knocked at our door and me and him made a plan to fling open the door and run as fast as we can to the train, and that's exactly what we did, we ran so fast and jumped into the moving train and that was it. We sat down and started playing with a child in the train. \n\nIt was a nice dream, very random, but comforting an exciting. I can't stop thinking about it, I feel like I wanna go back. I kinda miss the older man I was with. None of my friends or family members from my reality now were in the dream, in fact it seemed like they didn't exist. Of course in some parts of the dream there were technology from the 21st century such as my iPhone and the train door opened up like they do at the subway. \n\nI didn't think much of it until I discussed it with my friend and she suggested maybe a past life?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 44506, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is it possible that I dreamed about my past life?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562624735, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cacva8/is_it_possible_that_i_dreamed_about_my_past_life/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "stonedangel777", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_300agfg9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562537957, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cacspq/half_awake_half_asleep/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cacspq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cacspq/half_awake_half_asleep/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562537958, "score": 1, "selftext": "So what happens a lot of the time when I\u2019m dreaming I can\u2019t open my eyes.

soul/spirit and the human potential visualized by Star Wars, which is a symbolic film about the atomic soul and divine spirit inside all of us.\n\nWe have been searching for ages, something beyond ourselves, some meaning and purpose to our lives.  What is living all about?  Is there anything beyond this life?  What meaning is there to this experience we call life?   To understand yourself, is the beginning of wisdom.\n\nThis plane is where beings can witness their creative power in manipulating energy or matter with whatever attitude you express with your emotions.  These emotions is your individualized and personal \u201cprototype\u201d of organic technology.  It is infused with organs, blood, consciousness, energy, artificial intelligence (EGO), DNA and your frequency specific karma.  Your body, family, and limitations is your karma.  \n\nOur soul lives next to our heart and records everything we experience.  Our spirit/double holds our body together within our energetic egg/auric field which transmits our reality 70cm/roughly 28 inches in front of you.  What we can\u2019t see is all black, a void.\n\nMost of the time we deny the presence of the soul because we cannot perceive it with our senses.  But we also can\u2019t see radio waves, air, sound or microscopic bacteria, but they are there.  All feelings of happiness is from the soul.  Any feelings of distress are due to the body.  When you look at this reality, all things were created through this atomic soul, or the spirit spark of the heart.  \n\nThe challenge of this reality is that we are trying to attain eternity, bliss and knowledge inside of an imperfect instrument.  That is why we have to come to the realization of our existence beyond this flesh and blood.  We have to become masters rather than servants of the body.\n\nWe attain knowledge once our soul is healed, which is guarded by your double/spirit.  This power has both polarities of creation and destruction and we are here to learn to master them.  The body is doomed to it\u2019s kingdom as long as the Spirit is unawakened, but when the Spirit is awakened and has clear, emerging power, it is the kingdom of heaven being brought from the Spirit into the physical.  \n\nIt is that of true love, powerful and magnificent and all-encompassing.  The human is fickle.  Spirit is not.  Spirit must be developed, and we develop it by choosing to be it.  It too needs its food.  It needs us to be it and to develop it.  \n\nWhen we can fix our attention to the energy within the heart and raise our energy up to the top of the head, one then attains the perfection of \u201cyoga\u201d and can transfer themselves to any planet or place in the material world.  \n\nThere is a new heaven and new Earth coming.

Gay man was raised jewish and catholic.  I have no religion but read a ton about them\n\nWe talked about religion vs spirituality,  collective versus individual spirituality, and how belief systems in the individual and the collective can either be something harmful or helpful to the end of universal benevolence.  How the spiritual,  individual experience influences the collective religious and vice versa, that they are always in conversation and when they're not, there is the risk for collective fanaticism or individual delusions. \n\nWe talked about equal access to information, and changing the education system to be able to teach more diverse learners, how teaching empowerment in one's own ability to discern truth is more important than finding the truth and indoctrinating young people, since the truth is always changing.  We talked about how our purpose as a generation is to be a buffer between the younger ones and the primitive minded people who are trying to value all human activity on a capitalist scale.  \nWe talked about starting as a clean windowpane as a child,  and how each experience is like a paintstroke on the window. Either accentuating or obscuring the truth behind the window, and how very important and sacred the child's perspective is. \n\nWe talked about the workweek. That there have been endless studies showing marked increases in productivity and the wellbeing of workers who do a shorter workweek. We lamented how far away peace seems to be for us, working 5 day weeks,  and how much we'd do if the world valued and made space for our human activity outside work.  \n\nWe talked about whether religion is \"bad\", as ex mormon guy believed.  I told him that every single religion is pointing to the same truth, but the moralistic and ritual side of each religion appraches that truth from a wholly unique place. And that the disposition of the individuals and the agreements of the community will determine whether that belief system will be appropriated into world benefiting or world dividing/harming actions. That the belief system itself is inert. That the way people choose to insert it into life is the matter that determines it's health as a religion. \nAnd we talked about the capitalist attitude toward art. How even the most confident creatives rank their ability next to others. We talked about how creativity and expression is innately human and how we should work to stop valuing it based on how likeable or sellable the creation is, and start valuing it by the meaning it has for the individual and the people who behold it. That we should honestly open up our perception of what is valuable and accept the myriad contributions of every person and recognise that every and all contributions by people and all things have an affect on the trajectory of the world, not just the ones that we will admit.\n\nAnd i didn't know them before but my heart rings with pure familliarity and goodwill towards those folks.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 44473, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Had a theology talk with an ex mormon tattoo artist and a super wise gay man living in a tent, and a homeschooled man.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562608990, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ca9sum/had_a_theology_talk_with_an_ex_mormon_tattoo/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "GodIsButLove", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_p5g5r", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562519397, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ca95n7/amma_sri_mata_amritanandamayi_devi/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ca95n7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "a73e23e6-841b-11e7-95a2-0ec544fa7318", "link_flair_text": "Video", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ca95n7/amma_sri_mata_amritanandamayi_devi/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562519398, "score": 0, "selftext": "https://youtu.be/AbpBM_qKZ5g\n\nI\u2019m just now being introduced to this fascinating and inspirational soul.

Consciousness is originally pure, like water. But if we mix water with a certain color, it changes. Similarly, consciousness is pure, for the spirit soul is pure. But consciousness is changed according to the association of the material qualities. Real consciousness is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. When, therefore, one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is in his pure life. But if his consciousness is adulterated by some type of material mentality, in the next life he gets a corresponding body. He does not necessarily get a human body again; he can get the body of a cat, dog, hog, demigod or one of many other forms, for there are 8,400,000 species.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 1: What is our Real consciousness ?

The muscle grows back stronger if it has enough energy. Until then it remains a wound and eventually dies.\n\nBut nothing ever dies of ours. When we lose a limb this just means the matter is gone. The arm still exists. You feel the ghost.\n\nOur spirit is a ghost of our body. The holocron. The concatination from the heart centre to the finger tips and beyond in to the energy field and to the cosmos. But we are distinct. Our centre never dissapears.\n\nWhen you destroy the body it ceases to be apparent in this convenient reality. It invented limbs and senses so it could pull energy more quickly. So it didn't have to wait for energy to be slowly magentically drawn in. The body is an ongoing bluprint stored inside the immortal part of ours in the heart centre. This is physically where it exists. The world manifests around it.\n \nDNA is a trend which gets drawn in. You know you eat fat for energy and protein for muscle. The essence of physicality is in blood itself. This is why magic can ve done with blood. You pour blood on a spot and you have a small entity brewing. If you feed anything with blood it will start to gain animal wisdom. It will lust for more concentrated energy and for the blueprints to make a body.\n\nThis how a baby is born. There are an infinite amount of heart centres aka black holes and if you slap a bunch of material on one it starts to breed it's own entity.\n\nYou could create anything with the right understanding. Create new designs. This is off topic. Because I believe honest creatures who belong in reality are created using a balanced equation that makes them an animal rather than some power demon. The reality is slow. The process of life creates a storybook in DNA. This clings to one being.\n\nAscension is when you die and the principle of regeneration uses it's acrewed memory to create a new body. Your body stagnates even though it understands higher dimensionality soob after it is born.\n\nThe trend happens to be that you have to live in your body until it dies because there are no strong outside forces destroying your body. So it just slowly consumes energy waiting for the day when it gets absolutely destroyed and can now move freely.\n\nYou use life to learn about life so you can create a denser body. The idea is to find out the highest ibtelligence and become more like the updated trend of life. Until you die you cannot regenerate.\n\nDying is like a recovery sleep. Then your innate and never ending energy resurges making a bigger fresh start breaking all the old trees in to vastly expanded territory. We are a hydra. We grow forever.\n\nLimbs may not grow back because we have not learned this function. We aim for quick death as humans. We are weak in this life because we see that overstaying is not worth it. We gain enough energy in our first few years. The rest is just garbage.\n\nOur spirit goes to sleep while the life decides whether to continue living on autopilot or to end itself. Either way time is not a factor. The body plays with itself and messes aroubd with reproduction. But ultimately this whole reality is awaiting the Death of your individual. When you get old it even conspires to end itself. There is no point even living past birth. If you are malnourished you have to spend a bit longer finsing out that raw blood is the only complete food. Then you get all the nutrients in perfect.\n\nYour next body will be able to hold more life just like the bodybuilders muscle holds more weight. The universe gets better because life is so easy to the point of being pointless but suicide just makes it vetter. \n\nIt's kind of the joke of this stage of life is some tragedy. Doom metal is about doom but it sounds good and gets better the more you listen. Life gets allways better. Allways the same but allways better. The spirit doesn't care about death because it can't feel the pain it has allready conditioned.\n\nYou enjoy returning to your core and feeling the greatest agony it is the standard of a natural progression. We are getting the energy and using it well. We are at the pinacle of spiritual evolution. \n\nOur next arm will use even less effort to grab zounds more energy.

In my dream I was in this beautiful place with white structures and my uncles and aunts were there so I was comfortable. I can\u2019t piece all parts of the dream together, but I do remember the euphoric feeling and there being a entity beside me. She told me whatever I did in life to be strong and to never kill myself. I remember being so young and confused and with the comprehension of a child thinking \u2018Never, why would I do that?\u2019 The being was talking to me a little more and it was advice on the subject that I wish I could replay in my mind. Going back to present day, I think of that dream all the time now, and use it as a promise to myself and this being that I would find anyway to not give up.

won't mind.)\n\n\u200b\n\n**Part 1:**\n\n**Recognizing the Consuming Parent Archetype**\n\nThe consuming parents, or the old consuming the young is a prevalent archetype in our current period. It is a deep trauma that the Earth is currently being healed from, and I am here to give you some advice on recognizing and healing this wound.\n\n\u200b\n\n**What is the Consuming Parent?**\n\nAlso known as a narcissist, they are someone who falls victim to instilled trauma and generational baggage. They seek emotional incest, reparations, validation, and nourishment from their own children. They can take the form of individuals, collectives, corporations, governments, environmental hazards, and even inanimate objects. The programming of these beings is to prevent the future, discourage growth, reject unity, reject individuality and absorb/consume all traces of innovation and change.\n\n\u200b\n\n**What are some manifestations of this archetype?**\n\n\\-Sexual Abuse\n\n\\-Teachers who focus on discipline over education\n\n\\-Principles who punish children for being bullied\n\n\\-Pollution and environmental waste\n\n\\-dysfunctional economies\n\n\\-Taxes\n\n\\-Police Violence\n\n\\-Demanding sacrifice\n\n\\-High expectations\n\n\\-Reparations for the past\n\n\\-Slavery\n\n\\-Gaslighting, manipulation\n\n\\-Pedophilia\n\n\u200b\n\n**For Men:**\n\nBe aware of the consuming mother archetype. These are the women in positions of power that want to drain the man of his spiritual energy, identity, or resources. The Ice Queen from the classic fairy tale who kept the boy imprisoned in her ice palace. When the female has not resolved her relationship to the anima or men, she will project onto the young men her insecurities. The dark female seeks to absorb the light male and take advantage of his compassionate and sacrificial tendencies. This often manifest as emotional incest where the mother seeks the son as a surrogate husband. On a deep level she wishes to become him and play out repressed power fantasies. This manifests in society as women having high expectations for men and expecting them to go through shame games.\n\n\u200b\n\n**For Women:**\n\nWomen must be aware of the predatory, consuming father. He does not recognize the life or independence of the opposite sex and demands women be extras and even objects in his life theater. This manifests as the domineering boyfriend, the manager who harasses and flirts with his subordinates, and the ones who treat women as prostitutes. Rather than the absorbing nature of the dark female, the dark male relies more on giving the light female things that she doesn't want, and tangible energy that will harm her. He has excessive trauma that he flings like shit at women due to his fear of inner-work.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Part 2:**\n\n**How you heal from the Consuming Parent**\n\nBelieve that God is not a consuming parent, but rather the purest manifestation of service. Recognize that the consuming parent turns the children against each other. Take time to serve yourself (selfishness truly does not exist, it is only negative if it is a manifestation of fear that hurts others). Harbor and love your individuality.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Positive Parent Archetypes**\n\n\\-The Sun (only serves)\n\n\\-The Earth\n\n\\-Trees\n\n\\-Artists and Musicians\n\n\\-The Ocean\n\n\\-Your Higher Self\n\n\\-Healthy Communities\n\n\\-Your Friends\n\n\u200b\n\n**Beliefs that will heal your authority trauma:**\n\n\\-I accept life (one of the most fundamental programs)\n\n\\-I accept that life changes\n\n\\-I accept that I am a caretaker of future generations\n\n\\-I accept service\n\n\\-I love and accept the present\n\n\\-No one owes me anything, I do not owe anyone, anything\n\n\\-I serve not out of obligation, but because I seek connection\n\n\\-I care for the space around me\n\n\u200b\n\n**Last Section: Refrain from eating your own children**\n\nDo not root yourself in air. The consuming parent often has a very tangled energy and unresolved chakra issues. Starting with root, they are often disconnected or at conflict with their communities, the earth, and their spaces. They keep themselves and others in survival mode by rejecting their roots. Do not reject your roots. Moving onto sacral, artists are at danger of consuming their own creations, their art, by immediately assigning their identity and expectations about how their work is read and perceived. Artists: do not create to consume. Create to serve yourself or others, or to process complicated feelings. Warriors: fight to protect and serve those you love. Healers: heal. Speakers: speak.

Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nIn this verse the identity of the living being is clearly given. The living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord-eternally. It is not that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated state becomes one with the Supreme Lord. He is eternally fragmented. It is clearly said, san\u0101tana\u1e25. According to the Vedic version, the Supreme Lord manifests and expands Himself in innumerable expansions, of which the primary expansions are called Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva, and the secondary expansions are called the living entities. In other words, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva is the personal expansion, and the living entities are separated expansions. By His personal expansion, He is manifested in various forms like Lord R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41hadeva, Vi\u1e63\u1e47um\u016brti and all the predominating Deities in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. The separated expansions, the living entities, are eternally servitors. The personal expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the individual identities of the Godhead, are always present. Similarly, the separated expansions of living entities have their identities. As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities have also fragmental qualities, of which independence is one. Every living entity has an individual soul, his personal individuality and a minute form of independence. By misuse of that independence, one becomes a conditioned soul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated. In either case, he is qualititatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is. In his liberated state he is freed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of transcendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated by the material modes of nature, and he forgets the transcendental loving service of the Lord. As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence in the material world.\n\nThe living entities, not only the human beings and the cats and dogs, but even the greater controllers of the material world-Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva, and even Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. They are all eternal, not temporary manifestations. The word kar\u1e63ati(struggling or grappling hard) is very significant. The conditioned soul is bound up, as though shackled by iron chains. He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent which is driving him in this material existence. When the mind is in the mode of goodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion, his activities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance, he travels in the lower species of life. It is clear, however, in this verse, that the conditioned soul is covered by the material body, with the mind and the senses, and when he is liberated this material covering perishes, but his spiritual body manifests in its individual capacity. The following information is there in the M\u0101dhyandi-n\u0101yana-\u015bruti: sa v\u0101 e\u1e63a brahma-ni\u1e63\u1e6dha ida\u1e41 sar\u012bra\u1e41 marttyam atis\u1e5bjya brahm\u0101bhisampadya brahma\u1e47\u0101 pa\u015byati brahma\u1e47\u0101 \u015b\u1e5bnoti brahma\u1e47aiveda\u1e41 sarvam anubhavati. It is stated here that when a living entity gives up this material embodiment and enters into the spiritual world, he revives his spiritual body, and in his spiritual body he can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. He can hear and speak to Him face to face, and he can understand the Supreme Personality as He is. In sm\u1e5btialso it is understood that in the spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured like the Supreme Personality of Godhead's. As far as bodily construction is concerned, there is no difference between the part and parcel living entities and the expansions of Vi\u1e63\u1e47um\u016brti. In other words, at liberation the living entity gets a spiritual body by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\nThe word mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba\u1e25 (fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord) is also very significant. The fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is not like some material broken part. We have already understood in the Second Chapter that the spirit cannot be cut into pieces. This fragment is not materially conceived. It is not like matter which can be cut into pieces and joined together again. That conception is not applicable here because the Sanskrit word san\u0101tana (eternal) is used. The fragmental portion is eternal. It is also stated in the beginning of the Second Chapter that (dehino 'smin yath\u0101) in each and every individual body, the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is present. That fragmental portion, when liberated from the bodily entanglement, revives its original spiritual body in the spiritual sky in a spiritual planet and enjoys association with the Supreme Lord. It is, however, understood here that the living entity, being the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is qualitatively one, just as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 1: What is the difference between Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva and the living entities ?**\n\n**Question 2: What information is given in this verse from M\u0101dhyandi-n\u0101yana-\u015bruti: sa v\u0101 e\u1e63a brahma-ni\u1e63\u1e6dha ida\u1e41 sar\u012bra\u1e41 marttyam atis\u1e5bjya brahm\u0101bhisampadya brahma\u1e47\u0101 pa\u015byati brahma\u1e47\u0101 \u015b\u1e5bnoti brahma\u1e47aiveda\u1e41 sarvam anubhavati ?**\n\n**Question 3 : Why the word mamaiv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba\u1e25 (fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord) is very significant with reference to this verse ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/15/7](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/15/7)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 44162, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 15.7", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562401270, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c9dhms/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_157/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "EricaInAmerica510", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_34k5rnc7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562307279, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c9cjbh/help_with_moving_on_social_anxiety/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c9cjbh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c9cjbh/help_with_moving_on_social_anxiety/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562307280, "score": 2, "selftext": "Greeting everyone I hope your having a great day ! I am in a tough situation, I\u2019m sure it has something to do with me healing and learning/ fixing a past life relationship/ moving on. My best friend of 7 years, my soul mate, is in a committed relationship with a boy. I have always been in love with her, but her feelings weren\u2019t the same at first, after awhile she had feelings for a little bit but they went away I asked her if it was something I did she said no it just kinda happened . I\u2019m trying to move on , but it it so hard, I think this is trying to teach me something. She is the only person I have ever opened up too, I have severe social anxiety and have also been working on that too. Trying to open up to people. But I just get this unbearable feeling when I\u2019m in public situations where I have to communicate with others, like when I\u2019m in public I will sweat buckets my stomach will start to get knots beacuse of how unnerving it is . I\u2019ve cut myself off from everyone, the only friend I have is her. Then again the only friend I\u2019ve ever had is her. I\u2019ve always been the loner, the kid everyone thinks is weird, never really fitted in . But that is one thing I need to heal and learn more about, like why I do that, why I cut myself away from people, why do I make myself a outcast? But anyways the more I try to move on from her the more hurt I get and angery, I\u2019m not mad at her I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m mad at, it\u2019s unexplainable. But does anyone have any advise or comments or thoughts for my journey?

However because of this it seems I try to live in a delusion that I am not being hurt by others. \n\nI noticed I refuse to acknowledge when someone is hurting me, because then that shows the person I am weak or deficient because they are able to hurt me...and thus gives them a sense of power so they will feel at more of an advantage to bully me because they see I am vulnerable. So I fear if I \"fight fire with fire\" that they will just come back and hit me harder, and i dont want to deal with any conflict so i try to pretend it doesnt exist. \n\nAre there healthy components to this thinking? I try to act in line with holding space for a steadfast peacekeeping paradigm and if I \"doubt\" my priorities of peace I feel like I'm betraying or losing faith for what we as a species are meant to be, how we are meant to relate.\n\nI tell myself I refuse to ever hate someone, see them in a negative light, or act unkind no matter what is done to me. It must sound naive though because i cannot trust that others will read my mind and honor my best interests. I'm also under a lot of life stress and afraid that if I admit I need to stand up for myself, that I will become paranoid and even more avoidant of people. I can't afford that right now.\n\nSo for example, an acquaintance has said vulgar sexual things and been open about wanting to \"displace\" my partner, from the day I met this acquaintance. I believe they think I will be easy to use and take advantage of, and I take it so personally wondering whats wrong with me that someone treats me with such disgrace...perhaps its a result of the combination of my positivity (\"stupidness\" to some), illness and low energy, and passiveness. I seem like easy prey I guess? Which is very hard to accept.\n\nI want to rebuff this acquaintance but am terrified of accidentally making an enemy if I reject them and they feel embarassed. I fear them gossiping about me, lying about me, bullying or physically attacking me even, if I outright reject them. And even them doing the same to my partner. I just want everyone to get along.\n\nI don't know how to protect my best interests without feeling guilty for being \"unspiritual\" for having brought up and out the nasty in others. I fear the damage to my self image if I fail to protect myself perfectly in a way that also keeps the peace. I fear feeling like a spiritual failure if I can't keep everyone feeling good and safe around me. I feel like my purpose is to be pure sunshine all the time for people I dont know well, but consider maybe that's an ego thing to want to seem mysterious and etheric and worthy of receiving positive things? And also to keep people at arms length by being robotically nice..\n\nThis person who harasses me lives at the same apartments as me, we both work here too, and I can't avoid them completely. I also want to stop making choices based on avoidance. I want to feel strong.\n\nJust sick of feeling weary avoidant bullied and unable to stick up for myself in a spiritual honorable way that also doesnt create future issues for myself. I can't afford to move if things go sour with this person so I'd rather just act like it doesn't bother me to be treated like cheap public property, but it gnaws at my self perception to receive such treatment.\n\nWhat's the balance between holding space for a peaceful paradigm, and practical self protection??", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 44140, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How to be a peaceful person and also protect myself?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562380537, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c9aqh2/how_to_be_a_peaceful_person_and_also_protect/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "hemingway_hamlet", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3qgft8ta", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562284182, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c99brx/what_does_it_mean_when_every_time_you_build_up/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c99brx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 37, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c99brx/what_does_it_mean_when_every_time_you_build_up/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562284183, "score": 73, "selftext": "If it\u2019s a cycle that repeats continuously in your life, what does it mean?

Tonight's protection working I will use psalm 52 to repel evil. But today's post will be about psalm 1\n\nPsalm 1\n\n\"Oh the joys of those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or stand around with sinners or join with mockers. But they delight in the Law of the Lord, meditating on it day and night. They are like worthless chaff scattered by the wind, they will be condemned at the time of judgment for sinners will have no place among the godly. For the Lord watches over the path of the godly but the path of the wicked leads to destruction.\"\n\nOk so let's break this down, now commonly this psalm is used as a precursor to some other psalms when doing protective works or to restore peace in ones home and life so let's have a look at why.\n\n\"\"Oh the joys of those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or stand around with sinners or join with mockers.\"\nOk so this is advice as not every one deserves to be around you and not everyone is your friend but it's also prompting the spirit to make changes in your life to benefit you by removing destructive influences from your household and your life.\n\n\"But they delight in the Law of the Lord, meditating on it day and night.

It\u2019s a daily occurrence that I hurt myself in some way. I\u2019ve always been accident prone since I was a child, but I never questioned why I always got hurt. I tend to think I\u2019m quite careful, but it could be that I\u2019m just reckless. \nMy close friend noticed an increase in injuries in the past couple of months and she asked if I have an unhealthy relationship with pain. I never really questioned it, but this brought up a whole line of questioning. I don\u2019t expect to get hurt, it\u2019s usually a surprise when I hurt myself. One thing I noticed though is that I don\u2019t really mind being hurt, and even sort of enjoy it? I\u2019m not sure why but I am not afraid of pain as much and I have no problem with being hurt nor does it affect my everyday mood. In fact, maybe it makes me happier?

unable to engage with me the way a child needs her mother to engage. i detected back then that she was not attuned to me, did not mirror me, the way a mother is supposed to attune to and mirror her child in natural bonding play. i shut down from that long ago. and that skin that i hardened to protect myself from those around me over the years is still covering me now. it is a barrier around my heart, deeply defiant of connection. while the soul caged inside yearns for it. to be released, to be free, to meet others' hearts. \n\ni'm not alone in this i know. many mothers cannot attune to their children, and those children grow up to be mothers who cannot attune to their children. but there are degrees of severity that determines the fragmentation of the child. that's why we look for 'good enough' instead of perfect. but many people who turn to spirituality, turn to therapy, turn to self insight and exploration, did not have 'good enough' and that's why we're  here. \n\nanyway so i guess this is what i'm going to be dealing with for the next few months. the work i've already done so far will help me. but i have so much more to go. so many monsters lurking in the shadows controlling me, who will turn out to be merely wounded scared children trying not to get hurt like we did before. who merely need to be held and have their stories heard and secrets shared and their burdens finally unburdened so that they can join those of us that feel whole  and safe and happy. it's quite a range to cover.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 44078, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "splinters", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562356655, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c926vs/splinters/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Drumandnoise", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_127hfm", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562243755, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c923da/im_very_confused_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c923da", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 36, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c923da/im_very_confused_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562243757, "score": 18, "selftext": "First of all - English is my third language so I apologize for bad English.\n\nOk, so I don't know anything about spirituality and I'm most certainly not religious.  I'm a very  logical person - a scientist.  I've always been attracted to the darker things in life.  Dark music (Black metal - even satanic metal), I'm always dressed in black and have been part of the goth community for 20+ years.  Just let me add, I just like the music and I really don't care about the message.  If a bunch of Christians would make that music, I'd also listen to it :)\n\nThe other side of me ... I'm different.  I've known this since I was a teenager.  I really hate it but at the age of 42  I'm starting to accept it.  I'm also anti-religion ... I just don't see the added value.  Just being a good person is good enough for me. \n\nSo i became sick when I was a teenager.  The last 20 years I have been going to doctors and I have only getting worse.  The last 5 years I have been experiencing these very weird feelings, very hard to explain but they kinda drove me to one person.  Lets call her B.\n\nB does spiritual things.  I made my first appointment with B and the only thought in my mind was : 'Oh my god, what am I doing here?\".  But the truth is ... I felt it.  So i made another appointment, and another, and ... \n\nSo as logical person I was completely not prepared for this and the things that are happening to me are really really freaking me out.  Yesterday was a great example.  \n\nI have been going to B for months and she always has this Rosary on her desk.  I have learned not to watch it, because it always pulls me in.  So earlier this month I finally had to courage to ask why I'm so attracted to it.  She just said : You're a child of God.  (Which translates  to blablabla in my head.)  Yesterday she had a gift for me, a small rosary.  Again I watch it and it pulls me in.   She was doing her normal things again and I couldn't breath anymore.  I told her there's something here making me feel bad.  I had no idea it was the rosary.   She has this pendulum (do you call it that way) and it was going nuts, but it all seemed normal to her.  She said ... wow you're spinning now.\n\nDriving home was unlike anything I have felt before.  I was so glad I made it in one piece.  I went to my living room and sat down and then the most freaky thing happened.  A toy train was standing against the wall and it just started riding.  It made so much noise, so I took it and the button was on \"OFF\".  I switched it to on and off and it stopped.  Logical person + weird thing = going nuts!  \n\nIf this was an isolated case I could say it's coincidence, but these things happen to me all the time.   I have NO intention to explore (my) spirituality or to become religious.  But things are getting worse and it's like I'm being driven to this one path.  The more I fight it, the harder it comes back.   \n\nI'm not sure I just wanted to share it with someone.   Sometimes I think I should give it a chance, but I just want to be healthy and happy again.  \n\nI guess i have no choice right?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 44078, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm very confused and I don't know what to do?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562356608, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c923da/im_very_confused_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "deadpres1dent", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_32ykmbgf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562242627, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c91x3v/today_time_is_flying_particulary_faster/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c91x3v", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c91x3v/today_time_is_flying_particulary_faster/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562242630, "score": 5, "selftext": "Before anything: hello everyone, how are you feeling today?\n\nI usually live the moment and don't pay attention if time is going faster or slower as days seem \"normal\" to me in terms of its duration.

One who reaches it never returns to this material world.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe spiritual world, the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-which is known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana-is described here. In the spiritual sky there is no need of sunshine, moonshine, fire or electricity, because all the planets are self-luminous. We have only one planet in this universe, the sun, which is self-luminous, but all the planets in the spiritual sky are self-luminous. The shining effulgence of all those planets (called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas) constitutes the shining sky known as the brahmajyoti. Actually, the effulgence is emanating from the planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Part of that shining effulgence is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material world. Other than this, the major portion of that shining sky is full of spiritual planets, which are called Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dhas, chief of which is Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs long as a living entity is in this dark material world, he is in conditional life, but as soon as he reaches the spiritual sky, by cutting through the false, perverted tree of this material world, he becomes liberated. Then there is no chance of his coming back here. In his conditional life, the living entity considers himself to be the lord of this material world, but in his liberated state he enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes the associate of the Supreme Lord. There he enjoys eternal bliss, eternal life, and full knowledge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne should be captivated by this information. He should desire to transfer himself to that eternal world and extricate himself from this false reflection of reality. For one who is too much attached to this material world, it is very difficult to cut that attachment, but if he takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is a chance of gradually becoming detached. One has to associate himself with devotees, those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should search out a society dedicated to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and learn how to discharge devotional service. In this way he can cut off his attachment to the material world. One cannot become detached from the attraction of the material world simply by dressing himself in saffron cloth. He must become attached to the devotional service of the Lord. Therefore one should take it very seriously that devotional service as described in the Twelfth Chapter is the only way to get out of this false representation of the real tree. In Chapter Fourteen the contamination of all kinds of processes by material nature is described. Only devotional service is described as purely transcendental.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe words parama\u1e41 mama are very important here. Actually every nook and corner is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the spiritual world is paramam, full of six opulences. In the Upani\u1e63ads it is also confirmed that in the spiritual world there is no need of sunshine or moonshine, for the whole spiritual sky is illuminated by the internal potency of the Supreme Lord. That supreme abode can be achieved only by surrender and by no other means.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 1: What is the significance of of the words \"parama\u1e41 mama\" ?**\n\n**Question 2: \"For one who is too much attached to this material world, it is very difficult to cut that attachment\". How can one gradually cut this attachment ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRelated Pic :  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/15/6](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/15/6)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 44064, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 15.6", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562355549, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c8zw2u/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_156/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Fractal1214", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3rntv57r", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562226795, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c8zvll/offering_indepth_tarot_readings/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c8zvll", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "e4fe724c-8418-11e7-8ef1-0ee29c473ac4", "link_flair_text": "Self-Promoting", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c8zvll/offering_indepth_tarot_readings/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562226796, "score": 0, "selftext": "$5 for 1 question and a follow up.

I was completely sober at the time (I only make that point because I am a somewhat habitual user of de herb) and had been for three days, and was making my self dinner; just some eggs and chicken on the grill. I was feeling somewhat spiritually high that day and especially at that moment, so I decided to put on a lecture by one of my favorite teachers, Ram Dass. I forget exactly what the nature of the dialogue was but I was very much into it, and after finishing my food and the 45-minute lecture while laying in my bed, I wanted more. So I stayed where I was, feeling very relaxed and empty, and put on a lecture by Alan Watts. Generally I love Watts, and I find that his poetic objectivity to spirituality contrasts well with the radiant open-heartedness of someone like Ram Dass (both of whole however I love and enjoy equally), but this lecture wasn\u2019t doing it for me. About 15 minutes or so in I decided to switch the video to another lecture by Terrence McKenna which was on the nature of reality (I believe it was this one: https://youtu.be/GecpVGQPkSI). While I was very initially intent on the video, the more relaxed I felt in my now dimly lit room the less and less I was focusing on what was being said, and was more focusing on my contentment with the present moment and present state of my awareness. Eventually meditation crossed my mind and instead of trying to sit up in a more traditional pose and shut my eyes, I remembered something had read recently prior about an alternative form of meditation where your awareness is focused entirely on an object. So here\u2019s where it gets juicy (or at least as much as my descriptions can make it) lying in my bed, belly up, there was my dresser to the right of my field of vision, and my entertainment center to the left. On my dresser was a can of shoe cleaner that was just sitting there by itself, and this was what I chose to focus my awareness on. At first I was just observing this can, letting it \u201cthing\u201d without allowing my preconceived notions of what it was to enter my head. \u201cThis is just another gross expression of matter and energy simultaneously co-existing on the same plane as myself\u201d, I thought. After about 30 or so seconds of this sort of devoid attention towards the can, everything started to take on a slightly darker tone, and develop a sort of \u201cshadow\u201d filter to them. The can looked like it was projecting a shadow behind it, as did my dresser, and as did everything else that I could make out in my peripheral vision. For a fraction of a second I had a thought of \u201chuh, look at that!\u201d but decided to ignore it, and just kept observing. After another 10-15 seconds, something developed over my eyes that I can only describe as like looking through a fabric softener, or a wedding veil. This sort of white, textured filter over my vision. Observing it, I felt a very weird (yet totally self-assured) inclination that this filter was not \u201cover\u201d my eyes, but \u201cbehind\u201d them. So, I \u201cpushed myself back into myself\u201d and brought my awareness back behind my eyes? If that makes any sense? This is something I had seen and heard conceptualized by people before but which I had never felt, but I had (and still have when attempting to describe it) this visual of my awareness suddenly being placed behind my skull, or like my head was becoming \u201cempty\u201d because my awareness had gone inside of it rather than pushing out. After this happened, the filter of white instantly went away, and my field of vision, still with its focal point on the can of shoe cleaner had become alive with purple, orange, red, and pink hues, taking from a Jimi Hendrix poster that I had hanging caddy-corner to my dresser. The left side of my FOV, however, where the entertainment center was, became pitch black. Everything still retained its form, but took on an almost obsidian color. Suddenly both sides of my FOV starting subtly shaking, gradually getting faster and more intense, until both of them started...fusing together? Almost looking like the combination of yin and yang, these two opposite halves forming into one another seamlessly. Then, everything, and I don\u2019t mean everything physically, but I mean everything as in my whole field of vision, came rushing towards me in this modge-podge of colors and distorted material images. It was like increasing the zoom to 200% on your web browser but gradually coming closer and closer. That\u2019s when I snapped out of it, and honestly just pussied out a little. Everything else I could manage but that was very overwhelming for me. However, right after I shot up out of bed I felt this incredibly warm and loving feeling and lightness to my being, and needless to say that to this day this single 2-3 minute experience has only moreso reaffirmed my beliefs and only made me more motivated on my journey.

Pretty young, right? I've been through quite a lot though and have a lot of childhood trauma to heal from. I started taking psychedelics at 19 by starting with an LSD trip that lasted almost 18+ hours. It changed my life and my perspective on so many things. Over the next 3-4 years, I have been growing in my spirituality steadily so. I started studying astrology at 19 and these past 2 years I dived right into philosophy by studying the great works of all those lovely people (Alan Watts, Joseph Campbell, Terrance McKenna, Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud, Kahil Gibran, and so on). \nI've come to a tipping point in my spirituality by beginning my journey of The Hermit.  I have never really been alone, I've always been involved with someone or have been in love to some degree where another person has taken up so much of my mind space and energy. This is the first time I'm truly commiting myself to my Self and not getting involved with anyone else sexually or too emotionally. I don't have a good relationship with my parents or my brothers or anyone in my family, really. They all live too much in the secular world and don't like to talk to me about the spiritual discoveries I have come to in my experiences. They all just ask \"do you have a job? Do you have a career? What are you doing for money?\" It's just always about money. I'm starting to separate from them and just completely let go of all the judgements I face from them, all the negative conditioning I've had from them, all the superficial love, just everything. It's a slow process and takes lots of meditation and \"shedding of skin\" but I woke up this morning after some really intense dreams and have come to realize it's like push ups. Once you realize you have to start working out, you can't just do one session of exercise and expect to be ripped. It's consistency and the motivation to continue to grow and learn each day. I have to keep letting go each and every day and keep moving forward. It sucks sometimes because on an emotional level I feel like I have to repeatedly \"say goodbye\" to these people and environments and things and it's just not easy when I've spent my whole life around these people and in this toxic environment. Even though I know it's bad for me, it's what I know. I'm moving clear across the country in less than 10 days and the universe is truly preparing me for it. I see synchronicities every day, in the form of numbers mainly but also blips of insights and random reassurances through meditation. I'm getting better and better at letting go as the days go by and I've never been so focused on myself. Pushing past the loneliness that I feel at first and really learning to enjoy my own company has been the hardest but today is the first day I woke up without that hollow feeling in my chest from being alone. \n\nIf you're on your path, I wish you the best of luck in learning to let go. It's truly beautiful and I have never felt more free in my whole life. It's like a huge weight has been lifted from me and even though I have an intense and rough journey ahead of me, I'm ready and continuing to ready myself each day. Learn to truly love yourself and your own company, find out who YOU are outside of childhood trauma or conditioning, outside of anything that has externally happened to you, who are you on the inside of it all? \nI'm shedding many layers of my life and shedding many people out of my life who just aren't good for my highest potential. I'm going to reserve my time and energy and attract those who will grow with me and /want/ to grow with me. I've cried so so much throughout this whole process and have felt suicidal along the way but I'm now at a place where I understand that this entropy I have been experiencing is just the old breaking down and breaking away in order to make room for the new. \nPractice makes perfect, they say, and I practice letting go every chance I get. \n\nTldr; Keep trying, no matter how much you get knocked down, and you'll eventually get where you wanna be. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nMany blessings to all of you out there! I pray you find peace in your solitude and come to find that we are all connected in this aloneness. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd8b\u2728\ud83c\udf3b", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43979, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "No one expects you to master it on the first try", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562351045, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c8qnyn/no_one_expects_you_to_master_it_on_the_first_try/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "usernamealrdytakn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kaud2l2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562170451, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c8pzqn/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_155/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c8pzqn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c8pzqn/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_155/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "LwB1tcDoxcfriNLqilHGQBWPSCBCfiJ5nQjDCd3Jyk4", "resolutions": [{"height": 72, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/N2ovFkbKk0AAMzvVNS2VI_G_bOv-xzIOVoSRI20LmLY.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e74c9296c898a9477e3f3d722d8c53847cc71c61", "width": 108}, {"height": 144, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/N2ovFkbKk0AAMzvVNS2VI_G_bOv-xzIOVoSRI20LmLY.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca50874f4d6dec8aac15f1072f6cb5b061067d34", "width": 216}, {"height": 213, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/N2ovFkbKk0AAMzvVNS2VI_G_bOv-xzIOVoSRI20LmLY.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=644766187065fa2d12610d469c65a29207627756", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 400, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/N2ovFkbKk0AAMzvVNS2VI_G_bOv-xzIOVoSRI20LmLY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=c492bcae953b86cf8a43e3daf649aa1cfbfcf8f6", "width": 600}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1562170458, "score": 1, "selftext": " \n\n***\\*Please write answers to the questions in comments\\****\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u092e\u094b\u0939\u093e \u091c\u093f\u0924\u0938\u0919\u094d\u0917\u0926\u094b\u0937\u093e \u0905\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0928\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0915\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0903 |**\n\n**\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0948\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093f\u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0903 \u0938\u0941\u0916\u0926\u0941\u0903\u0916\u0938\u0902\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0948-\u0930\u094d\u0917\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u092f\u092e\u0942\u0922\u093e\u0903 \u092a\u0926\u092e\u0935\u094d\u092f\u092f\u0902 \u0924\u0924\u094d || \u096b ||**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**One who is free from illusion, false prestige, and false association, who understands the eternal, who is done with material lust and is freed from the duality of happiness and distress, and who knows how to surrender unto the Supreme Person, attains to that eternal kingdom.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nOne should know by the cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord of material nature; the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord. When one is free from delusion caused by pride, he can begin the process of surrender. For one who is always expecting some honor in this material world, it is not possible to surrender to the Supreme Person. Pride is due to illusion, for although one comes here, stays for a brief time and then goes away, he has the foolish notion that he is the lord of the world. He thus makes all things complicated, and he is always in trouble. The whole world moves under this impression. People are considering that the land, this earth, belongs to human society, and they have divided the land under the false impression that they are the proprietors. One has to get out of this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world. When one is freed from such a false notion, he becomes free from all the false associations caused by familial, social, and national affections. These fake associations bind one to this material world. After this stage, one has to develop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate knowledge of what is actually his own and what is actually not his own.

I don't really know how to begin this inquiry in the best way, so I will just start with a short description of myself. \nI have always been a rather spiritual and mindful person. I often felt myself floating above many things, feeling like I'm somewhere else/on another plane of existence. I was very intuitive and I had a lot of precognitive dreams. There were points in my life where I felt sort of inhuman, in a good way. I had a strong connection to this world, both visible and invisible parts of it. I was able to establish deep connections with people and help them deal with lots of things easily. \nI was able to create a lot music and be really creative overall.  There were times when I felt like I am completely submerged in this higher state, there were times when I felt like I was just dipping my toes in it, and everything in between, but it was normal, since these things tend to fluctuate for me, and I guess not only me. \n\nThe problem is, for the last year or so, I have been feeling like I really lost my purpose, and and that higher state of being has left me and this part of me was locked for some reason. I started to feel like I am constantly banging my head on a door, unable to get in. My creativity has almost completely disappeared and I barely feel connected to anything. I also found that I started feeling much, much less emotion-wise. \nThere were no traumatic or big events in my life that would change something about me so drastically. I can not understand the cause of this and I can not get out of this empty state, despite regular meditation and reflection. I can't seem to reach out and touch what I could call my higher essence, because it just feels like it's not there anymore. While I still have spontaneous bursts of this feeling again, it is very short-lived and I can never sustain it. It just serves as a reminder of what once was. Everything just feels blank, hollow and uninteresting right now. I don't think I have depression, since I consider myself a rather happy individual and my life is quite good on a material side of things, but with this spiritual element of my life missing, I am starting to feel like I have lost my way, and this brings me great discomfort, since living with no sense of purpose feels extremely like...nothing at all(this is the best way I can escribe the feeling my current situation gives me).\nSo, has anyone faced this before? Can you give me some advice on what to do in such cases, or point me in a general direction? \n,", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43919, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Rediscovering your higher self.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562210641, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c8j1oo/rediscovering_your_higher_self/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "britfried", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2fkufyfu", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562121816, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c8inhq/my_boyfriend_has_anger_issues/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c8inhq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "ff48d9ae-c323-11e7-bd5d-0e515489cb82", "link_flair_text": "Relationships", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 35, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c8inhq/my_boyfriend_has_anger_issues/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562121817, "score": 12, "selftext": "I\u2019m not sure if this is the right place for this question, but I figured you people would have some good advice.

this simulation called life, reality, our dream, our illusion.  Reality is a game of thoughts playing with matter which creates deep realities that control our emotions until the dreamer, you, wake up. \n\nThis reality doesn\u2019t belong to us, we are strangers here.  When we interfere with this reality, we have no idea who we are messing with.  There are ways to leave this game, but not change it.  This reality has a purpose and we can exit it, through the mind.  Because Humanity follows those who save themselves.\n\nWe are all just watching a movie we are creating.  This reality is a school and there are ways to graduate.  This school is called Earth which is an anagram for Heart.  We came here to create ourselves through love and to be greater than the body.  \n\nThis is a spiritual school.  We experience this material world, because we contested and did not take God seriously.  Thus we descended to this material platform, a prison for our conditioned souls.  That is why we are here.  Not to be entrapped by material gain and glitter but to use our energy to develop Christ Consciousness, the most important part of a living entity and to become liberated souls.\n\nI also talk about the 3 \"keys\" we need to attain in order to graduate.

I watched many ghosts hunting shows (don't ask me the names 'cause I don't remember \ud83d\ude01) both on tv and later on on YouTube. Before I started the high school, I considered myself as a believer (christian) even if the only thing i cared about the bible was the Noah's ark story (i love animals). When I started high school, one of my classmates' skepticism put my \"faith\" on crisis, so i started to consider myself as, first an atheist, then an agnostic.\nAfter finishing high school (last year) i took an year off and so i had a lot (and i mean a LOT) of time in my hands and so i spent a lot of time on YouTube. \nOne day i didn't what to do so I searched for some videos about consciousness and a lot of them were about life after death and NDE. After watching these videos (and many other /askreddit videos about ghosts and stuff) I started thinking that maybe there's a chance that there's something after this life and maybe there can be this creator figure who started all. I'm still trying to figure it out and I think I'll come out with some personal interpretation of god without following any religion \nI'm sorry for the long message but I wanted to share this thought and in real life it's kinda difficult 'cause 1 I think that many of my friends won't understand me 2 you can't just out of the blue while your on a party come out with this \ud83d\ude01\nFor all the people who read all of this well thank you and good for you it means that you're very VERY patient so happy life stranger and remember when you're eating chicken fried wings you're eating a mini-trex fried wings\n\n\nBy the way i put in the description the word god with the capitol G so you can understand what I'm talking about even if i think that the big 3 (Judaism, Christianity and Muslim) are far from my concept of god", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43826, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "After many years I'm starting to belive again", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562132597, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c85faw/after_many_years_im_starting_to_belive_again/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "glg212", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_31kscoe5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562039289, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c84e8f/simplicity/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c84e8f", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c84e8f/simplicity/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562039289, "score": 1, "selftext": "synchronicity.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43818, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "simplicity", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562125669, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c84e8f/simplicity/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "elegance-and-class", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2su37vug", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562037086, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c841my/why_am_i_not_happy/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c841my", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c841my/why_am_i_not_happy/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562037087, "score": 1, "selftext": "  I\u2019m a pretty lucky person.

This evil in the world came in the form of a massive protest in Germany, with many volatile, violent folks present, that resulted in conflict. Following this months later was a massive mushroom trip that not only showed that evil and conflict back to me, but awakened the inner workings of my darkest subconscious mind, the likes of which I was not wholly aware of. These experiences have left me with much to digest, including mental chaos akin to PTSD, and one of the stranger revelations to me: a lack of desire for pleasure.\n\nSee, much of my life growing up was quite easy, and I really wanting for nothing, and as I've aged I've seen how that has stunted my ability to contend with the harsher elements of the world. Thusly, my desires in the last 8 months or so have centered around self-improvement, discipline, education, order, etc. This brings me to the greatest pickle of this whole thing, that I am in a polyamorous relationship, the structure of which caters to and thrives on ones ability to be able to ethically puruse greater connection and potentially sexual pleasure than monogamy historically allows. My problem is this: I've always been pretty melancholy, but the last 5 years of my life have been filled with sensation, stimulation, adventure, and pleasure, which have by and large been unfulfilling. It has been handled poorly at times too, leading to detriment to my own person, and those around me, either through corruption of my moral character, self destructive habits, or blindness to bad paths because of my arrogance and self-aggrandizement (I was a touring musician).\n\nSo, now after feeling evil in the world, seeing the evil reflected back to me, and taking tally of things in life I've done to constitute a destructive path, the only thing that really brings me satisfaction or joy is pursuit of orderly, constructive, hyper-disciplined paths like exercise, scholastics, sobriety, and many more of the like.\n\nI DON'T HAVE THE DESIRE TO HAVE TONS OF SEX OR BE INVOLVED WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE. I'M INCREDIBLY SATISFIED BY ONE PERSON.\n\nSo, what should I do? What are your insights into such an outlook? I'm trying not to be so nihilistic, which happens occasionally, but it can be hard, and somewhat isolating to feel the way I do.

She helped me awaken and we were a thing until about January.\n\nI had sports and school to keep my time consumed and productive. Now that its summer and I'm back home and I only work, this \"depression\" wave is hitting hard. I have sort of reverted back to some old addictions, including nicotine. I dont feel much unless I'm high from smoking weed. Its just a complete flip from what it was before.\n\nThe thing is, I'm grateful for everything I have. I'm grateful I have the oppurtunity to work hard, I'm grateful for my knowledge and hunger to learn more about my career and how to help inspire others as well as learning about myself, I'm helping the people around me... Yet I just feel empty.\n\nIve heard of this before so I'm not too worried, I know theres a 2nd awakening period where you go through a rough patch with this newfound knowledge you have.\n\nHowever, I'm trying to ghost this girl because shes over me but I'm not over her, she still sends me things on snap but I just leave it on read. I'm working on myself and my happiness, its just ahrd to do when youre bored all day when you dont work. I study philosophy and psychotherapy but I dont want to do that all day.\n\nThis is me asking for advice, while also warning you guys to be ready for this 2nd period.

Now the value of the stock has declined to the point where I'm not sustainable without income. I feel my ego so strongly wrapped up in this experience that I am stuck and preoccupied every moment. I 'followed the signs' and not conventional financial wisdom which led me to great success, and now loss. I had ample opportunity to cash in but my greed and pride prevented reasonable decision making. I feel ashamed to have acted the way I did to friends, families, and strangers, and I grieve the loss of a sum of money that I can't foresee earning in my lifetime again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI behaved in an arrogant manner contrary to my principles rooted in my interpretation of yogic principles. I became enmeshed in the company and industry propaganda and served to promote my interests and discredit competitors through mild but still deceitful means. I spent some of my fortunate time being inebriated, consuming rich food, indulging in hedonistic activities, and even trying to force love with my perceived financial leverage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the initial stock price decline I took some time away from everything, travelled to Asia and studied and taught yoga, being present and mindful, but now that I've returned I'm attached to my thoughts and feelings again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wake up thinking of numbers, figures, and charts, and hope and pray for the the company that I invested in to right the ship again. I curse myself for my arrogance and I rage against the market and the individuals and groups who influence it with their power. I feel anti-social and unattractive and I believe that everyone who hears my current interpretation of my story thinks that I'm a fool for making the choices I did and that I ought to lay in the bed I made. I feel angry, resentful, guilty, and hopeless. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I dare to consider the wisdom of the east, this life and this lesson are for my current incarnation to experience and learn from but I am having so much trouble detaching from the immense suffering the I have caused to myself. Despite my self-flagellation, I do consider myself an agent of good and a helper to those in need, and I am trying to practice dharma.  I am not expecting reward for my positive actions but can I not hope for my financial situation to improve? How can I see this cosmic dance from an unattached perspective? Do I just give up and accept that I should not be involved in the markets? Do I accept that the life of monkhood is what I require to move on? Will I ever find my support/other soul love? Do I sell everything, take the loss, even though things may improve in the future, and accept simple living? How can I find balance in my current situation?  Where is the balance between personal finances and unattachment? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43741, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Help me to reframe- I am stuck", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562077812, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c7t9f8/help_me_to_reframe_i_am_stuck/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "Mr_Hoist", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_44pjjuk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561990979, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c7t6ig/the_past_is_nonexistent/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c7t6ig", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 18, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c7t6ig/the_past_is_nonexistent/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561990980, "score": 106, "selftext": "I hope this helps someone grow in the same way it continues to help me. I know it seems obvious from a glance and perhaps a moronic thing to say but it truly helps to accept this; not just understand it.\n\nWe think we are defined by our past mistakes and successes. We act like they dictate the outcome of our future. But the beauty of this, is that these concepts are utterly intangible. If the universe were a computer and we were data, you\u2019re past mistakes simply wouldn\u2019t exist anymore. They serve no purpose. Cause no action, no harm nor good. They just were. Now they are no longer. They exist only within yourself.\n\nI especially attributed far too much power to the things that I\u2019ve done that I regret. Guilt is a powerful thing. But alas, if you feel guilt, you\u2019ve learned from your mistake and thus can let it go. Holding on is pointless and self destructive. Meditate on it; why am I feeling this way? How do I learn from this? Let it go.\n\nIt\u2019s a gift to remember these things. Memories are nice to cherish and learn from, but they are simply building blocks to the present. It\u2019s when we lose sight of this that they become a curse. With every moment that passes, the old present fades. The memories stay with you, but the reality of it dies and blossoms into the now.\n\nMy advice is don\u2019t live in your head. Exist in your body and experience the universe to the fullest. Experience the here and now. Be the constant cycle of change that we truly are; not the sorrowful reminder of what has been.\n\nHope this wasn\u2019t too preachy.

But, they still don\u2019t acquire any knowledge of self.\u00a0\u00a0This cannot be taught, it has to be innate.\u00a0\u00a0Even though absent of mind and spirit, people still can do wondrous things such as advancing scientific boundaries, creating beautiful architecture, and generally finding new ways to innovate.\u00a0\u00a0Could you imagine the decades and lifetimes it takes to achieve these goals?\u00a0Imagine if someone spent that time advancing their spiritual boundaries, creating beautiful architecture which was to be their inner temple or creating new ways to innovate themselves.\u00a0\u00a0Industrious societies breed division: This is better than that, this is more efficient, this is more advanced.\u00a0\u00a0This also applies to humans as well, some are just more equipped to handle the dark ages we are in.\n\nMan has always lived in a fallen world, some eras were just better than others as far as making advances in society.\u00a0\u00a0The times we find ourselves in now are in the down trend of the chart.\u00a0\u00a0We are reinventing the wheel over and over again thinking it is something new.\u00a0\u00a0Any new advancement we have in technology is militarized, every scientific discovery is monopolized and created to defy god, every medical advancement we make costs hundred of millions of dollars to create and generate and hundreds of thousands of dollars to apply to a single patient at their cost.\u00a0\u00a0These are only a few examples.\u00a0\u00a0The world simply cant contain this population.\u00a0\u00a0The spirit of man has been watered down and diluted.\u00a0\u00a0People spend decades of their lives just waiting for the paycheck to sustain the fa\u00e7ade of the life they are living.\u00a0\u00a0It is a fa\u00e7ade because most of what people have is not even theirs yet.\u00a0\u00a0They are borrowing it from the banks or the government.\u00a0\u00a0In so saying, having property, a house, a car, a credit card to buy things you cant yet afford, is all an illusion just on the surface level.\u00a0\u00a0On another level, you are giving your life away to the industrious culture.\u00a0\u00a0Time is money.\u00a0\u00a0To make money you have to be productive and this takes up most of peoples waking life.\u00a0\u00a0You are donating most of your life just to be surrounded by things.\u00a0\u00a0Now given, shelter is a must and transportation is a must.\u00a0\u00a0But if it is bought within reasonable means and not excess then you could create a life where you may retire early.\u00a0\u00a0This is important because one must spend time \"soul searching\".\u00a0\u00a0It is never too late to do this.\u00a0\u00a0However some are not even capable or wouldn\u2019t know where to start so they are more accustomed to grinding out the hours at work.\u00a0\u00a0That does not seem like a fruitful life.\n\nAs soon as a child reaches grade school, from a sociological aspect, they are prompted to make new friends and get along with others.\u00a0\u00a0For some it does not go very smoothly.\u00a0\u00a0Over time they become the outcast and have an array of psychosocial deficiencies.\u00a0\u00a0The growing pain is arduous.\u00a0\u00a0The lack of integration and social acceptance begins as fear and then anger which opens up a chasm in the persons spirit.\u00a0\u00a0If the spirit of the individual is innately strong then they will maintain their post as an observer.\u00a0\u00a0However, if the spirit of the individual is weak then there will be a retaliation which can take many forms such as suicide, homicide, self-harm, substance abuse ect.\u00a0\u00a0As the years go by with the outcast, or, more appropriately, an observer;\u00a0\u00a0They will continue to have hardships with integration, some make an effort and some don\u2019t.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually, they will find a comfort zone within themselves and that can have many possibilities as well.\u00a0\u00a0Such as reading, writing, painting.\u00a0\u00a0But if the individual does not find an outlet or just does not have the energy then they will become depressed.\u00a0\u00a0The depression can be mild at first but some may slip into major depression and live day in and day out with no satisfaction in life.\u00a0\u00a0This can continue for many years. As the individual continues this pattern into late or post adolescence then something strange can happen.\n\nIf a depressed individual does not find an outlet and continues to have depression for most of their adolescence then things can get even more troubling.\u00a0\u00a0Brain waves are what dictate our moods and our overall consciousness.\u00a0\u00a0In basic deduction, the depressed person mainly experiences Alpha waves which are close to a hypnotic state and general apathy for the environment.\u00a0\u00a0When they are lucky they experience a higher level function of the Beta wave which occurs while one is actively thinking.\u00a0\u00a0Personally, Beta was only experienced an estimated thirty percent of the time.\u00a0\u00a0Not enough to effectively engage in the environment.\u00a0\u00a0As this pattern continues and higher brain waves are not being accessed, in later and post adolescence, then your brain chemistry will start to change.\u00a0Firstly, this phenomenon occurs in the later stages of the brains maturity.\u00a0\u00a0If there was a lack of higher brain wave function in the past, the brain will act upon that absence.\u00a0\u00a0It will do this because the whole spectrum of waves is needed to make a complete model of the brain.\u00a0\u00a0When the brain uses a certain evolutional mechanism it can \"jump start\" your brain into synthetically induced higher brain wave function.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPsychosis is an enigma.\u00a0\u00a0Nobody knows how to make sense of its occurrence.\u00a0\u00a0However, it is being laid out here what might pose a notion as to how this condition has happened to so many.\u00a0\u00a0Once the synthetically induced waves start to hit the brain, new pathways are made so that the brain can send signals to all parts of the brain quickly and effectively.\u00a0\u00a0It is giving one a jump start so that higher functions may be present.\u00a0But, for a typical person, they spend about a decade of their adolescence developing these brain wave functions while the individual who is operating mostly on lower brain functions experiences this synthetic \"jump start\" in only a matter of weeks or months.\u00a0\u00a0Episodes can be recurring if the brain deems it necessary to light up those dormant pathways so that the physiological needs of the brain are met.\u00a0\u00a0However, with all this new sensory input, the mainframe of the brain can go offline.\u00a0\u00a0This gives rise to hallucinations, paranoia, delusion ect. But why is it that most cases can be compared side by side and be so similar?\n\nPart of this generation is evolving.\u00a0\u00a0Different needs now need to be met that are absent in our societies.\u00a0\u00a0It has only been a century since the industrial revolution and what we are doing with it now has got out of hand.\u00a0\u00a0A lot of humans are just evolutionary noise that will be drowned out by a new era of a more advanced beings.\u00a0\u00a0We are getting closer to the God Head and the system will be dismantled.\u00a0\u00a0Someone who has not gone through psychosis or even in the least understood what the message was in their episodes will not understand this development. Although, this is not going to be an apocalypse, but it might as well have been.\u00a0\u00a0The war for eighty five percent of the population has already been lost.\u00a0\u00a0As was said, they are just evolutionary noise to be discarded.\u00a0\u00a0Imagine a world where everyone was in a delusion, it wouldn\u2019t take much.\u00a0\u00a0Just take the example from the earlier paragraph.\u00a0\u00a0People are living in their illusion of things that don\u2019t even belong to them.\u00a0\u00a0If that was all taken away, peoples world would fall apart and they too will be under a state of survival, or psychosis.\u00a0\u00a0Terrible violence would ensue for the majority, the weak minded individuals.\u00a0Evolution will take its course once the illusion is dismantled.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43701, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Origins of psychosis", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562039131, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c7np5k/origins_of_psychosis/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "Questionsinmyh3ad", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_41yksrm4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561951922, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c7nkfc/i_saw_three_white_doves_flying_together/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c7nkfc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c7nkfc/i_saw_three_white_doves_flying_together/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561951924, "score": 7, "selftext": "hello today while laying in bed in the corner of my eye i saw something flying,i always see birds from my window so i sat up to get a better view. i saw three white doves flying close together in a group, i got a feeling as soon as i seen them that they meant\nsomething and it was meant for me to see. i immediately went to google this since i\u2019ve been trying to become more aware of my surroundings and what they can mean spirituality. i googled but didn\u2019t find much info... i was wondering if anyone one here has seen or know about the meaning of three white doves?

From that book I got the chant \u201cOMM Shanti Shanti Shani OMM\u201d which I use 108 times with my Mala. \nAt my current situation I am confined to a location for the next 5 weeks.

My beliefs require empirical evidence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the longest time I've read about how meditation can work wonders for stress etc, so I began meditating a few days ago and the effects were immediately noticeable. It was an overall feeling of benevolence and calm. It's actually very easy for me to get into a state where there are no thoughts and just emptiness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring my last meditation, I suddenly saw something. I will try to describe it as detailed as I can. I saw a large snake coiled into several different loops. I didn't know where the head was, nor the tail. The only way I can describe it is that it was moving while remaining stagnant (in place) - in other words, I could see it's body moving with only one purpose, to form these loops. The snake itself was floating and from my viewpoint it's head was either to the left or right or vice-versa. The best picture I could find was this:\n\n[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bf/d9/5a/bfd95a7891bca4a0f12ca8218a817c27.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bf/d9/5a/bfd95a7891bca4a0f12ca8218a817c27.jpg)\n\n(except in this picture it's facing top down, in this vision it was facing left to right and it was so massive that it took up almost everything I could see.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything had a blue glow/tint to it, including this space I was in as well as the snake. Now, behind the snake I saw a woman's figure floating - and from my perspective it was difficult to see the entire torso because the snake was covering it up. However, what I could see were both her arms extended out. Moreover, she was wearing some kind of long headpiece, something you would see ancient Egyptians wear. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe feeling was just awe. There was no negative or positive feeling, I was just astonished. Unfortunately, this only lasted about 7 seconds - maybe because I couldn't handle it but I wasn't scared - just amazed. Now after this experience, I feel normal so far. Nothing has changed, I just feel the same relaxation and calm that I feel from meditating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter deciding to indulge my curiosity - I went online. Surprisingly, I found that visions like this are linked to something called the 'kundalini experience'. Is this true? Has anyone else experienced this? Was this a hallucination (however it felt more real to me than my dreams - it felt as real as every day life)?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43648, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Insane experience while meditating", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562000838, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c7gvb4/insane_experience_while_meditating/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "PupCornPanda", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_owtjakh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561913583, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c7gpbc/seeing_painful_snippets_of_my_life_during/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c7gpbc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c7gpbc/seeing_painful_snippets_of_my_life_during/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561913585, "score": 4, "selftext": "Hi friends,\n\nso, two days ago, I did some preparation meditation for about 20 min, followed by this opening the heart meditation I've been doing everyday, from Insight Timer. Basically in this meditation we chant Aham Prema (I am love) 108 times, while surrendering completely. About 1/3 of the time in, I started seeing images of recent wounds. It really seemed like I was watching a film with short scenes of my life. I did not conjure these images,nor did I feel i was 'thinking about them'. They just popped up. The only though I remember having was 'keep chanting'. So I did, and the images kept coming. Harsh words from others, a cold look from a former lover, all kinds of things. None of these images lasted more than like 2 seconds. And they kept going back in time. I saw images from several periods of my life. And in my childhood I saw one image that i know to be true (my drunk parent passed out on the kitchen floor) and another one which I do not think is true, involving abuse by stepbrother, 1.5 years older than me. I have no idea whether this happened or not since I had never seen that image before. I do know that when i was 15 he made a move on me, which was disgusting, but I refused and was safe. Maybe my mind made up this memory because I resent him? More broadly, as the Aham prema reached its end, I was sobbing, and I felt tremendous belief. I would appreciate any insights.

Let me get right to it! (for those interested in doing the action and work, skip down to the \"++ **Actions for you to take: \" Section**, but its good to read the background info a bit beforehand especially if you feel like this topic is really foreign to you. I just felt like I really needed to get this out to you guys as well as my family and others. May new topics spawn from this encourage me create more my own methodology and wisdom to help others. Feel free to critique, ask questions, add to this, challenge this, etc. As long as its civilized :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSTART--&gt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Index**: \n\npt 1/2 - ++ background info\n\npt 2/2 - ++ taking action\n\n# \n\n# ++ Background Info:\n\nI decided to add a new very needed page, which will be a new topic on my website [https://www.mindlessgap.com](https://www.mindlessgap.com/) as it is utterly important to understand this. Rather than saying what is, I am testing people or challenging them to think differently and understand something they may have never known about but is really important to know and be aware of!  \nThere is something really important for you to listen to in order to understand your self, as well as relationships with others; along the basis of a common symptom that happens quite often with ourselves and with others is, ***fighting***. Why you fight with yourself too. Why anyone fights for any particular reason, the answers are revealed in the link I am about to share. When you start to listen to these tracks, maybe it takes 1.5 hrs total at MOST, or maybe 45 min, you should be open minded and ready to learn something that will change your life and anyone else's life if they are unaware of this topic. Not trying to compare, nor judge here, but Michael and I are the only ones who are aware of this topic as well as maybe practicing proper techniques to maintain this topic. I don't want to tell you what the topic is, you should learn and figure it out and let me know what you learn.\u00a0\n\n  \nIn my most honest belief, if everyone were to be aware of this topic, understand it fully, the interactions involved, origins, triggers, etc, we would live a joyous life without pain and suffering or very minimal pain with no suffering at all. I will be adding content about this topic to my website about sacred knowledge because of its grave importance to know this, understand it, and manage such.\n\n  \nEveryone relates to this topic one way or another. Its impossible for one person to say, \"this topic does not apply to me. I don't have this 'topic' within me.\" These are simply denials, and further evidence that one is unconsciousness at the time, or completely unconsciousness.\n\n  \nAs for a cure for unconsciousness? I can not really give a 100% definitive answer now, there are many factors involved. One step towards he opposite of this, consciousness (knowing), is to ask God for help gaining this. There are things to eat and consume that aid consciousness and others that aid unconsciousness. I can't say its universal for all, there is no one recipe fits all types as each person is in their own UNIQUE timeline.\u00a0\n\n  \n***This topic plays along with consciousness and unconsciousness.***\u00a0\n\n  \nHere are the definitions for\u00a0**consciousness**:  \n\n\n&gt;**noun**  \nthe state of being awake and aware of one's surroundings.  \n\"she failed to regain consciousness and died two days later\"  \nsynonyms:\tawareness, wakefulness, alertness, responsiveness, sentience  \n\"she failed to regain consciousness\"  \nthe awareness or perception of something by a person.  \nplural noun: consciousnesses  \n\"her acute consciousness of Mike's presence\"  \nsynonyms:\tawareness of, knowledge of the existence of, alertness to, sensitivity to, realization of, cognizance of, mindfulness of, perception of, apprehension of, recognition of  \n\"her acute consciousness of Luke's presence\"  \nthe fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world.  \n\"consciousness emerges from the operations of the brain\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n/and\u00a0**unconsciousness**:\u00a0  \n\n\n&gt;**noun**  \nthe state of being unconscious.  \n\"someone gave me a crack across the head and I slipped into unconsciousness\"  \nsynonyms:\tinsensibility, senselessness, stupefaction, oblivion, unawareness, blankness, lack of sensation, lack of feeling; More  \nthe state of being uninformed or unaware.  \n\"part of her beauty was her unconsciousness of it\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ++ Actions for you to take: \n\nNow here is the topic I would like you to grasp well. Listen to the full chapter, you may need to listen multiple times just to fully understand. Notes will need to be taken to familiarize yourself with this unknown understanding of this common entity or topic that very few know about. Listen to this whole section:\u00a0[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ybojSvGaJPvE2XgySR2-W7pEoTpPpR\\_J?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ybojSvGaJPvE2XgySR2-W7pEoTpPpR_J?usp=sharing) this is DISC 4, total run time is 1 hr 11 minutes. The information is priceless but extremely applicable in your life NOW unto the end of the lifetime. This goes for not just you, but everyone.\u00a0  \nCan you confirm the topic for me. What is it? Click the link I just pasted above here\\* tell me what DISC 4 is all about.\u00a0  \n\n\nI ask simple questions, mostly to see if you are even taking time to put-forth the effort of mastering something that is extremely needed in your life and dads life, then perhaps my own and Nicole. The result of learning this one topic is to become a better human being. To take the higher road. To be righteous in ways of helping others and not causing unnecessary stresses/pains within your life that can easily reflect or rub off onto other people.  \nSo please take this TOPIC seriously, its the reason for your fights that have been going on for decades. Its the reason for your mental pains you still deal with. Its the reason that will help you break free, experiencing a new freedom, a new identity of being, one that is free from a lot of major pains, and all suffering! When beginning to listen to the speaker talk, its best to have a mind without judgement, to be open minded and accept and believe these new perspectives for logical reasons, to learn a new skill, to learn of how to become aware of something you never understood, and to learn how much grasp this topic has had on your mind. From the mind that 'it' infects, it effects the rest of your well being such as your physical body, your soul, your mental being, your peace of mind, your spirituality, others around you, and you becoming the victim of 'it'.\u00a0  \nAs I was a victim of this, many people still are, and even though I am aware and can control it a bit, its a never ending process to be aware of this 'topic'.\u00a0  \n\n\nOnce again,\u00a0[here is the link to this topic, DISC 4,](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ybojSvGaJPvE2XgySR2-W7pEoTpPpR_J?usp=sharing)\u00a0listen to each one, take notes, and answer this question that proves your understanding of this topic fairly well. MY questions / test questions is:\u00a0\n\n**MINI TEST: (Answer these questions in the comments if you want a challenge! You'd help yourself by venting and maybe help others by providing some new perspective that no one else thought of!)**\n\n1. What are the general solutions to overcoming this topic?\u00a0\n2. What do you think your solutions will be for this topic since everyone is a bit different and one person's solution is not so for another person,\u00a0*sometimes*?\n3. If you fully understand DISC 4, this topic which is about \"t\\_ \\_\u00a0 p \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_\" what have your learned and what unsettled \"p \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_\" is STILL lingering within you? (each \\_ indicates a letter, so guessing what the topic is should be fairly easy if you went through the audio information.\u00a0\n\nThis should be a lesson for everyone on Earth. If people respected and took awareness and control over this topic because they have knowledge and solution, the world will transform into a much more beautiful place.  \nPS: Feel free to critique this article. Be brutally honest, for that is necessary for the best growth.\u00a0  \nHope all is well, /r/spirituality ! Love you all and may you be guided easily with no effort and embraced with love from others. :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if this was enjoyable for you. Or dreadful.

I closed my eyes and kept thinking about Mario, until eventually I was me in my cousin's living room. Mario comes running out of the kitchen followed by a chainchump that bit my hand. I woke up feeling pain in my hand absolutely astonished about what I have just discovered. Not only did I dream about what I wanted, but it was vivid and unpredictable. I guess I was hooked. Dream after dream I began to realize I could do whatever I wanted. I was God basically until I reached the age of 12. I had a dream that a bunch of red people were dancing around a fire. It was strange, especially because of how conscious I was. Out of nowhere a massive force approaches me and says \"I don't want you no more\". I woke up genuinely upset and scared. Since then I would appear in a black void in the beginning of my dreams. Kind of like a Hub world of sorts. This is when things start to get weird. Sometimes I would get dragged out of my body throughout the house or wherever I was until the place I was in began to changed dramatically. It was almost like something was trying to show me something, yet nothing. One of the things it showed me was a black and white TV with a man speaking about what I would have assumed was important. Then something started coming in the black void to make sexual assaults basically. This fucked me up pretty bad. It felt real. I could not see. I could not control. I could not stop it no matter how much I thought and power I put into it. I felt worthless, angry, scared, frustrated, and feelings I can't describe. I would often wake myself up just to fall right back into the black abyss to essentially be raped again. You don't understand. I was literally afraid of sleeping for years. It stopped happening as often and sometimes I could be at peace and just fly around in the rain in my dreams. Then came a thought. A thought that still kills me inside. A thought I created just to see how fucked up something could be. This thought is so perfectly screwed up that it gave me major OCD. I wish I could explain it, although I never wish anyone to think of it. I'm not trying to be a dramatic sadboy, if anything it's an absolute understatement. I am just now learning the reasons behind the rape and that's because I very heavily lust I my dreams and it interferes with my priorities, and I believe a spirit of some kind punishes me or something weird like that. I should have gotten some context though. I looked up some specific details and I came across the 9 Circles of hell which are oddly accurate with my experiences. I don't know. I'm just tired and felt like I needed to get this off my chest. Share you thoughts and thanks for reading.

Help? Anyone? \n\nOne night I had a dream that I was in a very plain room, blue carpet, white walls. Suddenly, a figure came from a door in the side of the room and stepped in front of me -\nTo this day I remember him as clear as glass, every detail, like I was really there. He had the entire head of a Hawk, his feathers were light brown, his eyes glowed orange. The feathers stopped at the bottom of his neck, where his body was that of a man, very muscular, except his hands - his hands were covered in reddish hair, and had long black claws on his fingers as opposed to fingernails.\n\nI was frightened at first, but he spoke and said \"don't worry, I'm going to help you\"\n\nHe lifted his hand up to me and I floated off the ground, hovering in midair. The strangest part about this however, and the dream in total, was that I *felt* myself in the air, the weightlessness, I actually felt my legs swinging back and forth as if I were dangling from a string.\n\nThen he said \"I'm going to put the information for a box beneath you\"\n\nHe lowered his hand, as he did my body descended from the air, naturally lowering into a criss-cross sitting position, directly onto a wooden pallet that wasn't there before.\n\nThen I woke up.\n\nI tend to believe dreams are mystical in nature... So why would Horus contact me? Why does he want to help me?\nThis dream hasn't happened since so I haven't got the chance to ask... One odd thing, however...\n\nDuring this period of time I had a GF who was simolarly religious and spiritual. I told her about this, and she was frightened immediately. She recounted a dream she had before (verified, as when she brought it up I remembered she had mentioned it long before at some point) -\n\n(note, this part does get a little graphic) \n\nIn this dream she was in the middle of the woods when she heard yelping from a pup. She ran torwards it, finding a clearing. In the middle of the clearing was a dead wolf mother and her cub, the cub yelping.\nThe wolf mother was being eaten by the exact same being mentioned. The Birdman was crouched over the Wolf Mothers body, clawing into it and eating its heart.\nGF tried to run, but the Birdman saw her, chased her down with superhuman speed, tackled her and started ripping and clawing into her chest, and ate her heart as well. Then she woke up.\n\nBoth her and I have had vivid and terrible nightmares all our lives, moreso for her being diagnosed with schizophrenia, having hallucinations, etc. We're no longer together so no followup on that, but... It's interesting how the same character is so rapidly different to different people...\nWhy? Why was I on its good side? Who is Birdman?\nCould it be Horus, the Egyptian God? Or, some other Mythological animal I know nothing of?\n\nAny info and opinions would be appreciated.\nGodspeed, all, thank you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43615, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I had a dream of Horus (Maybe?)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561968296, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c7aqcj/i_had_a_dream_of_horus_maybe/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "lilbaby_em", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1cf7cz5j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561879402, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c7afvp/spiritual_reasons_for_addiction_to_overeating_and/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c7afvp", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c7afvp/spiritual_reasons_for_addiction_to_overeating_and/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561879404, "score": 6, "selftext": "I am totally clean and sober and I like a super active life style, so in most ways I'm pretty healthy mentally/physically.

I was raised a Muslim, loved (and believed in) the idea of God but couldn\u2019t wrap my head around some dogmas. I should have a post about it on this subreddit. Fast forward to now; it\u2019s holiday time, a really important exam has passed and I finally found some inner peace to question my belief. Here are some things that make sense to me:\n\n-God exists\n-God isn\u2019t an entity we can comprehend. We can\u2019t know what his actual form is. He could be one single entity, a number of perfectly harmonious traits or everything in the universe. \n-No matter what he is, he acts as one.\n-God can be referred to by any name or by any means. I don\u2019t think he cares.\n-God doesn\u2019t have any human emotions. Considering even a human can rid himself of his emotions to make a proper decision, the God must have come into existence without them.\n-God must be listening to us.\n-God has the power to intervene in our lives if needed but I think he wouldn\u2019t prefer disturbing natural the flow of life.\n-God likes us since we\u2019re created.\n-No food, drink or substance is prohibited by itself but any evil caused by them is. If a substance causes you to do evil then you must not take it\n-Anything for the good of other living things is blessed by God.\n-Afterlife exists but we can\u2019t know how\n-You don\u2019t need any special ceremonies to communicate with God but if you like them it\u2019s no problem.\n-Every religious place is considered sacred and can be prayed in as long as you don\u2019t disturb the followers of that religion.\n-There is no absolute right way of believing God so respecting other religions is the key.\n-Ceremonies of other religions can be attended but again it is key to not disturb the others. \n\nI\u2019m still continuing my spiritual journey and by no means say what I found out is the absolute truth. I\u2019m posting it here so that it can help people struggling with the same things I have. I\u2019ll remove it if it doesn\u2019t belong here.

The most extreme efforts of one nation is almost futile when looking at a world scale. We need to stop focusing on profit and start focusing on achievements. Real ones that are beneficial and will help us in the mid - late future. The world is apparently overpopulated as it is. And solving our problems is great. But without preparations we will multiply faster and more people will inhabit the earth before we are ready to handle them. So what will we do with this growing population? It is indefinite that there will be a point where we are simply at capacity. What shall we do then? Inhabit other planets? We seriously need a game plan as to how we move forward before we create more problems for ourselves. We keep switching leaders so often, and nobody is trained to think for the future. If you don\u2019t have someone scouting out the new territory, how do you know it will be safe to enter? How do you know what formation or maneuvers you will take, or what equipment you need or preparations you must make beforehand. \n\nThe way I see it the only reason we should have military is in case of unknown threat ie extraterrestrial invasions etc. But I\u2019d highly doubt that is even plausible. Plus if you take a look at the vastness of space. There are thousands of whole galaxies out there with us, with solar systems of their own with planets etc. There are most likely other beings out there just because of the number of opportunities and potentials in the whole universe. So it\u2019s pretty much up to us to make a story and a happy ending for our planet and race, that we could carry and share with our descendants and maybe other intelligent beings. Or we can succumb and die. We can refuse to change and self destruct. Literally. And it sucks because nobody wants this, but we all support it. And you can\u2019t evade it. The way everything is set up is that we are to dependant on our ways and too comfortable with continuing down this path. Even though it\u2019s one that is completely doomed. We are too comfortable on autopilot, nobody wants to study the course and switch to manual. And fly where we need to go. Not just in a straight line taking damage from all fronts whiles a death timer is on us. \n\nWe need a path manual. A manual for our future. I\u2019ll explain a few things. \n\nWe need a form of population control, or to use our space more effectively. At some point we will be at capacity since we grow in numbers. We grow fast.. we multiply so the rate only increases. We need to be aware of our numbers or be able to keep and maintain growing numbers. That\u2019s all. And of course everyone has an effect on the environment and requires resources. For a lifetime. This needs to be a factor. \n\nAnd that\u2019s all. If you have population control and responsibility your fine. Then you just eliminate your threats. Being climate change, famine, disease, war, and our mindsets. \n\nIt would be wise to control the rate of our growth being that our space is limited. Maybe not now but we should be aware of what time we need to be. If we control our population we can focus on distributing the wealth to everyone according to they needs. And obviously effort as-well. \n\nAs a race we\u2019re just confused as fuck. We\u2019re constantly looking for leaders to lead us. But they only account for the next few years. We need to focus on how we are going to survive and maintain ourselves on earth. How we are going to progress and advance as a species. And how we are going to inhabit other planets like earth hopefully. This planet is our home. And in order to live comfortably Nd safely we need to understand the laws and physics behind it. And us. We need to know the consequences of our thoughts, actions, and choices. And we need to be able to read and know the signs of threats, and rain patterns and things like that. Literally it would be smart to know the patterns of movements and instances before they happen. So you can make calculated predictions before they happen and make the proper arrangements. So you can avoid disasters. All these things are a lot more important than our focuses now. You can only reach your maximum limit. You why limit yourselves to a few years? Why limit yourselves at all? You need to think wayyyy way ahead and that\u2019s where you will go. You can think far, and others will get us through the day to day. Heck. You can do both. You can think far and be prepared for the daily as-well. \nWhen you shoot for a star don\u2019t just shoot blindly. Shoot accurately and shoot within your range. However long that maybe. You will hit it with 100% accuracy. A long as you have that kind of skill. It\u2019s simple. \n\nWe can pass through the destruction, we can pass through these times and we can make it without flaw. But you will never be told the full journey before it happens. You may have a sense. But not the whole scope. My only fear is that the powerful corrupt will not take a liking to my words. Putting us all at risk. As they rather live sweet to die hard/burn. Then to donate and experience greater than they could imagine. \n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n~Religion~\n\nIf our religion was to guide eachother correctly. And receive/listen to the best true word of love, guidance, reason and truth. \n\nOur philosophy was to accept everyone as a vessel for a growing soul, who\u2019s journey and destination was the same as ours. \n\nOur motivation was to bare fruit for each other and ourselves in many ways and techniques that is needed for us to continue happily. (Meaning we all offer our best, and supply a range of things that is needed varrying from entertainments, traditions, philosophies, preparations and plans for future, ideas, supplies and foods, etc) pretty much a diversity of things needed by a lot of different people. We would supply that. \n\nWe can take arm ourselves with important  teachings of wisdom and insight/intentions to arm and better ourselves allowing us to grow into nurturing beings that allows for us to do more. \n\nWe calm our minds and learn to reason and be constructive. Rather than just be ignorant angry and throw people into prisons. People commit crimes because they have nowhere to turn, or do not know how to solve a problem. Or don\u2019t have anyone to solve the issue for them. Souls that are strong and healed or intact do not find the need to commit crimes. Unless they faulted in their own weakness. \n\nOur goal would be to first divide and distribute all basic necessities first to all those in need. We would do the most effective and efficient action in order to supply the needs of others whiles thinking of the course of our future. \n\nOnce basic necessities like food and water are going out. We would should find ways to heal the land again. Stop global warming. And aid the impoverished nations into becoming nations that are moving on their feet. \n\nDuring this time there\u2019s a whole lot of things and activity going on world wide with daily work and affairs. But if we honestly want to do what\u2019s good. This is the better path. But things won\u2019t go word by word according to this of course. This is just the basic fundamentals and ideas to actually recovering and healing our people and planet along with it. \n\nOnce our people are healthy we should focus on advancing medically and technologically. We absolutely need to keep a healthy balance between nature and cities or else our earth will lose its beauty and we will lose resources. We know concrete over all the land will kill us. So we need to make a balance and be aware of the space we use and what we use it for. \n\nAs a person with their needs being taken care of. It\u2019s hard to complain and cause harm anymore. Because there\u2019s no use and it\u2019s very uneeded. So if we supply the needs to others. I feel naturally violence and disturbances will die down. That\u2019s a good thing. \n\nWe are in an ever expanding universe. That\u2019s been around for a long time now.. very very very long. Billions and billions of years or more. Who knows a trillion or more maybe. Space expands fast. There are 10 planets in our solar system. Stars, galaxy\u2019s, comets, planets. Cool stuff for sure. If we don\u2019t want to use our land more responsibly, or keep on increasing in numbers. We will have to have those people be somewhere. \n\nSo colonizing another planet is an option. \n\nBut personally I would say hold on until we can locate or find another earth too. Cus lets be real. Who\u2019s gonna want to live on a planet without life on it. That\u2019s depressing. \n\nIn all. This is the fundamentals of this message to you. That you should consider. \n\n- Treat and care for others as your equal. \n- Think and prepare for the future \n- Be responsible and offer your talents and skills to make life pleasure ful and fruitful\n- Be loving and not selfish\n- Guide one another accordingly and help whenever you can with your thoughts perspectives and ideas\n- Do what makes you happy within boundaries and reason. \n\nThese are some things I would think of. I know for a fact it would be helpful. From here on it\u2019s just up to you and your values and experience to judge wether you agree and like it or not.\n\nLeaders are absolutely necessary in order to run or operate with such numbers of people. Especially living the way we do. But without any preparations for the future I mean cumon. You\u2019d pretty much get to exactly where we are now. A planet with a death sentence. \n\nThis here is a solution. It doesn\u2019t matter who wrote this. What matters is that it\u2019s valid. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis is a piece of a perspective I can view. \n\nWhen I think of the world I see this. I see all majority of countries ran by corrupt governments because they are not capable of envisioning a better future for the earth and it\u2019s inhabitants. So instead they all just succumb to their own selfish desires and intentions whiles moving their countries forward in the way they see fit. \n\nI am aware of evil aswell. As I feel there are control groups out there who\u2019s made it their purpose to actually personally elevate themselves to a higher level financially in order to gain a \u201cexclusive and higher end\u201d experience. And others just like to control and manipulate the masses to do as they like. Under the illusion they are serving a government that is suppose to steer the country to something better. Which is a complete lie and illusion. \n\nVery few countries are on the right track in the way they operate and treat the members of their society. And how their society members actually behave and treat eachother. \n\nBut either way. The world is our domain. And should be treated as such. It is foolish to isolate each country from one another and not work with and treat each country as necessary. Heaven isn\u2019t exclusive so why are we? \n\nWe need to simply change our actions and values, dismantle our separation but maintain our cultures. These things are pleasant and memorable. \n\nI strongly believe that the actions we commit are a almost direct reflection of the world around us. As there is no murder in heaven. No violence. \n\nI also strongly believe that this earth is absolutely stunning in beauty and potential to become the best of what we make it. We just need to not be foolish in our development.. as we are now. If we adopt greater ways of thinking and not be so easy to cause conflict. It will be of great use. \n\nI think we allow ourselves to be influenced and learn from negative and destructive/repulsive behaviours and thought patterns that don\u2019t really serve us at all. But during this time we have to because if we do not we will find it hard to function in society. For example. If people weren\u2019t so negatively influenced by society and they were aware of the real condition of the world. And the causes and routes to the issues. They should all have the hearts to rebel. If that were to happen society could crumble if a true and quality leader couldn\u2019t lead properly. \n\nThis is a process though, I feel that we\u2019ve learned a lot through our walk through the dark. But we all know the darkness is scary and violent. And is not nice for anyone besides those who feed from it. Darkness deteriorates life overtime. That\u2019s just how it is.. \n\nIt\u2019s time we step out of that and begin to walk in the light. There is no problem with that. \n\nCavemen once looked into space would never think it\u2019s possible to get up there. Impossible to fly from country to country, couldn\u2019t even think of planes or phones to call anyone anywhere.. they thought one way and we have surpassed them. \n\nWe think one way at this time and we have difficulties aswell.. but it\u2019s just a matter of transcending these things.. just like how we moved on from before with the cavemen. \n\nWe will learn to be better overtime, but we cannot succumb to the temptations of evil. Think about how we will be operating 1000 years in the future, or more. You don\u2019t think we will be thinking differently or have different values? Nah ofc we will. We will be more beneficial.. unless we wanna let these dumbasses takeover and drive us to the doghouse. \n\n- At the end of the day it\u2019s simple. We are our own enemy. And that\u2019s all. Our enemy is our thoughts, emotions, values, and beliefs. Some are there to ultimately be of service, or destruction. The leaders of most nations do not serve anyone. That\u2019s just their front. What they are really doing is bathing in riches and fulfilling their ultimately destructive dreams and goals. And they get others to do they hard work for them and they just pay them a lot of money to continue it. For this reason I couldn\u2019t see any change coming from those kind of people. \n\nAlso politicians are too caught up in bettering their countries that they do not prepare for and research about the war on the world. And build themselves up to become more effective fighters. This prospers one nation maybe, but then the world is in shambles and they are also will be effected by those conditions and repercussions. Overtime making life harder and harder, almost unbearable even. And we would barely even be able to move any further, we will be too caught up in repairing the damage done to x locations and countries including our own. We would have to move people from place to place due to areas being unable to live in from being flooded, fires, and inhospitable areas. Creating cluttering in safe places. Then how do you feed all those people too when your losing land and all these things are happening? \n\nThink about it. These things are already happening. But we do manage to get through it. But what about later when it becomes even more possibly frequent and bigger? We need to make adjustment now because if we do not. We will be too dependant on pollutants, to the point where we would have to let society\u2019s and countries crumble, by abandoning pollutants in order to have a chance at recovery (everyone for themselves). Or we can maintain pollution to foolishly be more \u201ccomfortable\u201d for a time. Whiles being battered harder and harder by the conditions. \n\nEither way those are absolute crap, and crazy choices. But this is why we need to be more serious now and make better choices and decisions now before we get buttplugged ;(. LMAO. \n\nYeah I understand it will take effort and work to do better. But it also take pretty much the same effort and work to do worse. The only difference is that people are so accustomed to doing their jobs and routines it\u2019s easy and natural for them. So making a difference and changing priorities may seem like \u201creal\u201d effort. But effort nonetheless. I hope that\u2019s not the case though. \n\nAnyways. We need a revolution. Convincing word. Or a miracle because we lack major guidance and we have no clue or care about what we are doing or moving towards. \n\nPeople think there\u2019s nothing over the horizon. So why explore? \n \nHere is what goes on in the minds of the most powerful and corrupt men of the world. \n\n1. \u201cGimme gimme gimme now now now!!\u201d - Recieves garbage but they love it \n\n2. \u201cI am an asshole and manipulate others, I degrade myself and hate others because I didn\u2019t experience love or true value for others or myself\u201d \n\n3. \u201cIdc because I\u2019m dying, idc if the world burns\u201d \n\n4. \u201cIdc I want money I\u2019m a greedy monster\u201d \n\n5. \u201c I literally don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing but apparently I\u2019m successful\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how I view the deeper route to Their mentality\u2019s without even knowing them. In all cases its corrupted and destructive. So why are minds like those operating our endeavours, priorities, countries/society\u2019s/world. It\u2019s an equation for destruction. Anyways these people have no right being there, especially considering the fact they literally dictate the quality of our world and life\u2019s. \n\nWe need to think better and more effectively, and use empathy heart values and passions to empower ourselves and be more insightful. Guiding our way so we can prepare for challenges. \n\nLeaders don\u2019t care for that. At this time we need to tackle the real issues and dissolve the fake dramas we created to gain power over one another. I understand that there was no way to tell before the horrible effects of our actions. But now that we do we have to do something about it. \n\nBut as a people we are simply in a stranglehold from evil and corruption. And they wanna choke us out. \n\nYou can grow and learn now in order to become stronger in order to punch them and hit back, doing your part. But you need to have a perspective that is strong enough to knock them out pretty much. Which would take an honest long time to acquire. \n\nI could pretty much smash my knee in their face and k\u2019o them right now. But I don\u2019t have the position or means to atm. We all need to gain strength and become strong to knock them down. But it\u2019s a lot of commitment and purpose. Also everyone has a different set of responsibilities in their lives making them able or unable to complete or commit to different things/tasks unless they are willing to pursue their purpose goal or vision and commit less to the rest of their worries. \n\nIn all help is needed. And we only do the best/most that we can with what we are given. Depending on our mind/body/soul and spirit. \n\nAmen brothers/sisters \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Route To Our Problems And The Solutions\n\nI\u2019ll make this short. \n\nThe root of our problem are our thoughts, values, beliefs, morals, and behaviour. \n\nSociety and our way of life all operate on these things. So if you want a better way of life/society the people need to practice and improve in these areas and not be lazy or full with pride by rejecting this. \n\nLiterally everything on earth for a 100% fact was created by thought and intentions. Then the word was sent, to trigger a reply, then an action was committed to make this thought a reality. This is the gift of manifestation. We all have a hand in creating our lives. You just need to set your sights on what you like and pursue it. \n\nGod is the original architect of creation. And he allows us to participate in his domain. Allowing us and giving us our own dreams and visions that we would like to create. But now this power has been split up over time and handed up to the ill intended and low vibrational people in order to create their own pleasures and not ours. \n\nIf thought creates reality. Why in God\u2019s green earth have we given our powers to manifest reality, and hand majority of that power to people who literally only want to ensue violence and poor favour. Literally all around the world we are allowing people with very poor and corrupted minds to be the front runners of our race. And we can see where this gets us.. \n\nFor example in a world without \u201csin\u201d there world be peace and prosperity. Let\u2019s not talk about all the effects of a world like this because there\u2019s far too much to say. But my point is. We would have manifested completely differently. We would be a very advanced and quickly progressing species, very accepting and loyal to each other. We would honestly probably be exploring all over the universe right now and making awesome things. Finding new planets, looking and creating beauty, who knows, maybe finding new life intelligent or not. In all, it would be dope, earth would be our HQ and like command centres and we would probably colonize other or certain planets, and make impossibilities possible. As we have done before. \n\nSo I\u2019m not going to preach on oh we have to do \u201cthis this and that\u201d, it\u2019s simple. We need to manifest better. We need to make better things and come to better conclusions and make better solutions. There\u2019s literally an answer to everything you can ask. The answer just must be revealed.. through time effort and thought/brainpower. \n\nIt would be the best for leaders of like all nations to actually just drop their pride and step aside so people who are more suited can step in and clean up this mess.. it\u2019s as simple as that. Humans are smart.. a lot of us anyways. And those who are decent know the appropriate direction we need to take in order to move in a better direction. And yes. There is a best path out there. But our current leaders are too blinded by literally their own pride and ego to look and search for it. People think oh think ahead for the future. Our governments are focused on preparing for what they are gonna do now, and within a few following years. This is completely understandable as if they did not how could we operate in the present. But we need think further, or we will be blasted outta orbit. It\u2019s that simple. \n\nNow. What needs to be made is this. We follow the best path, and we do what\u2019s good, right, fair, and just. We will hold ourselves up to our own standards and the standards of God. And we shall not break them. As breaking them will provoke and create or manifest things that are against us. Hatred, violence, corrupted actions and thoughts. These things are destructive and when building something positive and fruitful we don\u2019t need that. \n\nTrolls are fine, trolling is fun but play with people who are thick skinned. Don\u2019t target the weak as they will be damaged and will take long to repair and heal. Maybe never heal too. Not all wounds makes you stronger. It depends on how you respond to pain or trauma. You must have a sense of responsibility when acting and speaking. And try to know how to correct a mistake or bad action. As making mistakes happen in life. We arnt perfect. But it\u2019s how we react and follow through with these mistakes is what really matters. \n\nNow let\u2019s be real. The whole world as it is now is against us. All of us. You. Me. Them. They. Everyone. Even those leading. Those in charge, are actually acting against themselves and they don\u2019t realize it. And it\u2019s because they lack vision and quality\u2019s. They let finite and minuscule things get in the way of better judgement and better ways of thinking and accepting new thought. \n\nAs of right now we are at the bay of the enemy. Who are at the bay of themselves. As we approach the threshold of danger, high danger. We could probably become more and more irritated and rebellious. And we will realize that there is less time to act. But even at this point there will still be barriers in place to contain our wills. There will be people in our way to physically stop us from changing direction/course. And let\u2019s be honest. Even if we find a way to break through their layer of defence. Where then do you go, what do you do, how do u get the bad people to comply. And will we even have the time to salvage what\u2019s left? \n\nIt\u2019s an honest hard task. Taking over by force is absolutely not an option in any case form or issue. Because this is a global threat and disaster. Simply revolting in one country will make very little to no progress. As one country cannot make the impact we need in order to change course. Because then the problems will still be alive in other nations. Which could them view you as a threat to their foolish wishes and power. And you know what could happen after that. \n\nSo really we need to explain our situation. And deviate from it. Collectively as a group. On a common goal. That being - Do what it means to be human, as a reflection of Gods image (a higher standard) and fulfill it. Knowing it holds more and is better for you. For all of us. Leaving nobody. Not even the \u201cbad people\u201d\n\nOur goals need to increase and progress gradually as we complete basic tasks, standards, and necessity\u2019s. That will ensure all of our safety\u2019s. And needs/security. Then we will grow into more complex goals and tasks later as a group one we are more stable and recovered. \n\nFirst what we need to do is - Not only hear, but really and truly listen to other people and understand them. People can scream in your ear and you will never hear or identify the real issue. The route of their pain. That is the key. That is what you must search for and understand and relate to. Then you come to a common ground and conclusion, and move forward together. You can either hold grudges forever. Which is childish and immature. Or you can move past them. Which is a big sign of growth. Now yes you can take your time doing this. \n\nWe need care for love. And look out for eachother. As we are all the same. We all cry to the same pain, and our hearts all align with them same needs and desires. As we all come from the same God. There is a deeper reason as to why we have been separated and have our differences. But it\u2019s not because we ourselves are truly different. We are just unique and share separate quality\u2019s. But we\u2019re all on the same journey. And within us is the same goal and same vision. This is what holds us together as a race. We are just too foolish to realize this. Ofc there are cases of deviants but they probably will serve another purpose one day or now. But if you believe in democracy, then you should listen to all of us. And what we all want is for nobody to suffer and cry. No one to be hurt or impoverished, manipulated or oppressed. Impoverished or malnourished. Nobody should life in ignorance or darkness, and be used lied to and acted wrongly against. These things are FUCKED up. And I will NEVER stand for them. Whether you stand with me or not. \n\nWe are killing each other, torturing the innocent and defenceless. Hell torturing anyone is unacceptable. We have absolutely no morals or standards for anything and anyone. And then we trick ourselves into thinking we do because in our countries there\u2019s food on our plates and roofs over our heads. And that speak for most of us. Oh fuck the rest though. If I can\u2019t see it it\u2019s not my concern. That\u2019s how you treat your lost brothers and sisters. You were conditioned from birth. To operate in a society. And submit to a world which purpose was to destroy you. You were not taught to gain heart and care/love. You weren\u2019t taught to use your immense power and will/passion. You weren\u2019t taught that if you strive for the impossible. It will all bend to your will in the end. \n\nWe were literally born into a world with powers and dominions. Army\u2019s and leaders(corrupt ones). And we\u2019re conditioned to stand on the sidelines and not interfere with their motives. Hell you can try. You can run for leadership but shit. We\u2019re you ever supplied with what is necessary to honestly make a dent in their little game? Fuck no. Born into a society odds are you are in essence very influenced and controlled.. who do you think teaches you and enforced law and creates our cericulms in school? The same government that is corrupted, and uses you. That you are against now after learning these things. You think they will give you the means to dismantle and break their empire they so love? Fuck no dude. They would rather just have you work for them and do their best to strip you of everything you need to find out more and or overcome them. \n\nThat being said. There is a bigger issue at hand here. We can pretty much imagine that the world governments are working hand in hand and creating drama and distractions. And small victories in order to keep us confused and unfocused. As if we all identified the problem. Which we now have. Almost. We could then be able to make them powerless to us essentially. Because they need us. Not we need them. They just want to but as much time as they can in order to make their empire stand until it crushes us. And they don\u2019t give a damn right now either. \n\nSo what do we do? Nothing. Spread this information. And I\u2019ll make more soon. Word is the key. That\u2019s the only way. Unless u want to trigger a major war. No country wants to be blindly overtaken by anyone, they won\u2019t care about what the cause it. It\u2019s an invasion. \n\nWe need to use reason and convince the destructors to essentially diffuse themselves and allow our visions and manifestations override their. As we need it. \n\nNow what does that mean for the future. A lot. But that\u2019s not a big deal. All you need to focus on now is how to get this/these messages across. And the rest will be handled. Always. \n\nSo what are we creating? Hope today, a real future tomorrow. Then incredibilities the next day. And that\u2019s all we need to know. For now. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe plan of our nations - \n\nElect a representative of each nation that will state the ideal goals and direction of their nation. And we will tell them if we will support that. \n\nWe can support anything that isn\u2019t a threat to our future. Or our people. \n\nA planet without life has no meaning. There\u2019s no point to a body, without a soul. We need to prioritize our soul, our lives, over our contraptions and creations. If there is nobody to be amazed by and appreciate your inventions. You have wasted your life and time. \n\nWe can dominate the whole planet, every planet. A universe. But without life what is there to gain? What have we achieved. It would all be lost if no one is there to see it. \n\nOur immediate start needs to be protecting the earth and it\u2019s people. We need to aid the dying earth, and send resources to the people without. \n\nThe simple solution it literally to prioritize ourselves and not our creations. Once we master and perfect that method, everything we create will be for us, and not against us, in short, mid, and long term. We need to take care of all those needs. All of it. And when I say we need to prioritize ourselves. I mean watching damn person on this earth and nobody left behind. Doesn\u2019t matter who they are. Could be the worst most rancid human out there. We won\u2019t treat them like royalty but we won\u2019t destroy them either. Give good people what they are owed. And the bad people only what they need. They may need a beating, time alone, time in bars, generosity, love and care. A whole range of things. But your goals should be to save rather than destroy. Although maybe sometimes you may have to destroy to save. But those are bad odds, not our worry. \n\nOnce we prioritize the health and well-being and states / enjoyments of ourselves. Every atom will bend to our will. Once we are for ourselves. Everything will begin to become for us. You can go fishing without bait, you will die of hunger. You offer nothing to the fish. No promise or effort. You put on the right bait and any fish in the ocean is yours to eat. \n\nWe are given a body and food. But without the right mind we are all dead and will go nowhere. But with the right thoughts and mind. You can achieve anything. \n\nDo not become a victim of your own mind. \n\nWe need stronger minds to lead us. The minds that are more trained and advanced than our own. Minds that have traveled further and accounted for more. Those are the minds that we need in front of us. Or else you will be endlessly bumping into walls. We need a direct path. One that was planned out. If we cannot find that, we are doomed one way or another. \n\nStop killing yourselves. Do not be a victim anymore. Just adopt this. And support life and humanity. This is Revolution. Supporting this is supporting yourself, and your future. \n\nWould you vote Bernie, Revolution, or both?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43548, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Guide to the universe", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561917105, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c72ckx/guide_to_the_universe/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "MomoNoMomoNo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2wvryawc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561829079, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c720yz/i_make_spiritual_stories_inspired_by_my_own/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c720yz", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "a73e23e6-841b-11e7-95a2-0ec544fa7318", "link_flair_text": "Video", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c720yz/i_make_spiritual_stories_inspired_by_my_own/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "caeywBDiIJO5gLBuxQq-uO58poUIRVvS8zx74lEdr4o", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/FmGsjO941LYM1ObzBn4ChoM_mlOEqJvmVRl5GkHGSQA.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5abb142a9c0803ca8aa54bc768936a5b288029cb", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/FmGsjO941LYM1ObzBn4ChoM_mlOEqJvmVRl5GkHGSQA.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38bf8069cbf5ef0c60696c130b0854dbde5c55f7", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/FmGsjO941LYM1ObzBn4ChoM_mlOEqJvmVRl5GkHGSQA.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35b48febebd5cadd8ce49a84aefbaef5ea965a77", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/FmGsjO941LYM1ObzBn4ChoM_mlOEqJvmVRl5GkHGSQA.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=04b56677fc630f7ba5f7e51e88305cc010d843a5", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1561829080, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43544, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I make spiritual stories inspired by my own experiences.

I would then wake up a few times during the night. The only time I would be able to sleep is in the morning when I had to wake up. After a few nights of 2 to 3 hours of sleep, I would be completely unable to stay awake in the afternoon. If I took a nap, I would jump awake after less than 5 minutes and this would completely ruin my sleep on the next night. Coffee kept me awake. Until I started taking too much and my eye started twitching! I thought I was doomed to not sleep. As soon as I would put my head on the pillow, I started thinking and thinking, over-analyzing my day, events that happened when I was younger, thinking of what\u2019s to come\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t sleep\u2026 or so I thought!\n\nI tried to fix it. My doctor recommended a few tests to do, sleep apnea, taking natural relaxing products, medication, hypnosis, no electronics, scheduled sleep, fasting, even saw a sleep psychologist who told me that geniuses tend to not sleep much, I was blessed with a curse!\n\nI kept not sleeping for a few years. Luckily, being quite hyperactive, my tiredness didn\u2019t show too much. I was quite energized. I knew I was not performing at my max. I wanted more, being ready for all the challenges life would bring me. I was quite competitive. I wanted to perform.\n\nMy quest to find a cure to my insomnia led me to different paths. I enjoyed the process, yet nothing seemed to be working. As Thomas Edison failed 10,000 experiments before he invented the light bulb, maybe I had to fail 10,000 myself too!

However, I do think having her message out there will encourage more people to do some research into her works and see that love is really the only right answer. I\u2019ve been browsing the spiritual community here and on YouTube and can\u2019t find anyone talking about her and the potential implications this has for our world.

The most extreme efforts of one nation is almost futile when looking at a world scale. We need to stop focusing on profit and start focusing on achievements. Real ones that are beneficial and will help us in the mid - late future. The world is apparently overpopulated as it is. And solving our problems is great. But without preparations we will multiply faster and more people will inhabit the earth before we are ready to handle them. So what will we do with this growing population? It is indefinite that there will be a point where we are simply at capacity. What shall we do then? Inhabit other planets? We seriously need a game plan as to how we move forward before we create more problems for ourselves. We keep switching leaders so often, and nobody is trained to think for the future. If you don\u2019t have someone scouting out the new territory, how do you know it will be safe to enter? How do you know what formation or maneuvers you will take, or what equipment you need or preparations you must make beforehand. \n\nThe way I see it the only reason we should have military is in case of unknown threat ie extraterrestrial invasions etc. But I\u2019d highly doubt that is even plausible. Plus if you take a look at the vastness of space. There are thousands of whole galaxies out there with us, with solar systems of their own with planets etc. There are most likely other beings out there just because of the number of opportunities and potentials in the whole universe. So it\u2019s pretty much up to us to make a story and a happy ending for our planet and race, that we could carry and share with our descendants and maybe other intelligent beings. Or we can succumb and die. We can refuse to change and self destruct. Literally. And it sucks because nobody wants this, but we all support it. And you can\u2019t evade it. The way everything is set up is that we are to dependant on our ways and too comfortable with continuing down this path. Even though it\u2019s one that is completely doomed. We are too comfortable on autopilot, nobody wants to study the course and switch to manual. And fly where we need to go. Not just in a straight line taking damage from all fronts whiles a death timer is on us. \n\nWe need a path manual. A manual for our future. I\u2019ll explain a few things. \n\nWe need a form of population control, or to use our space more effectively. At some point we will be at capacity since we grow in numbers. We grow fast.. we multiply so the rate only increases. We need to be aware of our numbers or be able to keep and maintain growing numbers. That\u2019s all. And of course everyone has an effect on the environment and requires resources. For a lifetime. This needs to be a factor. \n\nAnd that\u2019s all. If you have population control and responsibility your fine. Then you just eliminate your threats. Being climate change, famine, disease, war, and our mindsets. \n\nIt would be wise to control the rate of our growth being that our space is limited. Maybe not now but we should be aware of what time we need to be. If we control our population we can focus on distributing the wealth to everyone according to they needs. And obviously effort as-well. \n\nAs a race we\u2019re just confused as fuck. We\u2019re constantly looking for leaders to lead us. But they only account for the next few years. We need to focus on how we are going to survive and maintain ourselves on earth. How we are going to progress and advance as a species. And how we are going to inhabit other planets like earth hopefully. This planet is our home. And in order to live comfortably Nd safely we need to understand the laws and physics behind it. And us. We need to know the consequences of our thoughts, actions, and choices. And we need to be able to read and know the signs of threats, and rain patterns and things like that. Literally it would be smart to know the patterns of movements and instances before they happen. So you can make calculated predictions before they happen and make the proper arrangements. So you can avoid disasters. All these things are a lot more important than our focuses now. You can only reach your maximum limit. You why limit yourselves to a few years? Why limit yourselves at all? You need to think wayyyy way ahead and that\u2019s where you will go. You can think far, and others will get us through the day to day. Heck. You can do both. You can think far and be prepared for the daily as-well. \nWhen you shoot for a star don\u2019t just shoot blindly. Shoot accurately and shoot within your range. However long that maybe. You will hit it with 100% accuracy. A long as you have that kind of skill. It\u2019s simple. \n\nWe can pass through the destruction, we can pass through these times and we can make it without flaw. But you will never be told the full journey before it happens. You may have a sense. But not the whole scope. My only fear is that the powerful corrupt will not take a liking to my words. Putting us all at risk. As they rather live sweet to die hard/burn. Then to donate and experience greater than they could imagine. \n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n~Religion~\n\nIf our religion was to guide eachother correctly. And receive/listen to the best true word of love, guidance, reason and truth. \n\nOur philosophy was to accept everyone as a vessel for a growing soul, who\u2019s journey and destination was the same as ours. \n\nOur motivation was to bare fruit for each other and ourselves in many ways and techniques that is needed for us to continue happily. (Meaning we all offer our best, and supply a range of things that is needed varrying from entertainments, traditions, philosophies, preparations and plans for future, ideas, supplies and foods, etc) pretty much a diversity of things needed by a lot of different people. We would supply that. \n\nWe can take arm ourselves with important  teachings of wisdom and insight/intentions to arm and better ourselves allowing us to grow into nurturing beings that allows for us to do more. \n\nWe calm our minds and learn to reason and be constructive. Rather than just be ignorant angry and throw people into prisons. People commit crimes because they have nowhere to turn, or do not know how to solve a problem. Or don\u2019t have anyone to solve the issue for them. Souls that are strong and healed or intact do not find the need to commit crimes. Unless they faulted in their own weakness. \n\nOur goal would be to first divide and distribute all basic necessities first to all those in need. We would do the most effective and efficient action in order to supply the needs of others whiles thinking of the course of our future. \n\nOnce basic necessities like food and water are going out. We would should find ways to heal the land again. Stop global warming. And aid the impoverished nations into becoming nations that are moving on their feet. \n\nDuring this time there\u2019s a whole lot of things and activity going on world wide with daily work and affairs. But if we honestly want to do what\u2019s good. This is the better path. But things won\u2019t go word by word according to this of course. This is just the basic fundamentals and ideas to actually recovering and healing our people and planet along with it. \n\nOnce our people are healthy we should focus on advancing medically and technologically. We absolutely need to keep a healthy balance between nature and cities or else our earth will lose its beauty and we will lose resources. We know concrete over all the land will kill us. So we need to make a balance and be aware of the space we use and what we use it for. \n\nAs a person with their needs being taken care of. It\u2019s hard to complain and cause harm anymore. Because there\u2019s no use and it\u2019s very uneeded. So if we supply the needs to others. I feel naturally violence and disturbances will die down. That\u2019s a good thing. \n\nWe are in an ever expanding universe. That\u2019s been around for a long time now.. very very very long. Billions and billions of years or more. Who knows a trillion or more maybe. Space expands fast. There are 10 planets in our solar system. Stars, galaxy\u2019s, comets, planets. Cool stuff for sure. If we don\u2019t want to use our land more responsibly, or keep on increasing in numbers. We will have to have those people be somewhere. \n\nSo colonizing another planet is an option. \n\nBut personally I would say hold on until we can locate or find another earth too. Cus lets be real. Who\u2019s gonna want to live on a planet without life on it. That\u2019s depressing. \n\nIn all. This is the fundamentals of this message to you. That you should consider. \n\n- Treat and care for others as your equal. \n- Think and prepare for the future \n- Be responsible and offer your talents and skills to make life pleasure ful and fruitful\n- Be loving and not selfish\n- Guide one another accordingly and help whenever you can with your thoughts perspectives and ideas\n- Do what makes you happy within boundaries and reason. \n\nThese are some things I would think of. I know for a fact it would be helpful. From here on it\u2019s just up to you and your values and experience to judge wether you agree and like it or not.\n\nLeaders are absolutely necessary in order to run or operate with such numbers of people. Especially living the way we do. But without any preparations for the future I mean cumon. You\u2019d pretty much get to exactly where we are now. A planet with a death sentence. \n\nThis here is a solution. It doesn\u2019t matter who wrote this. What matters is that it\u2019s valid. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis is a piece of a perspective I can view. \n\nWhen I think of the world I see this. I see all majority of countries ran by corrupt governments because they are not capable of envisioning a better future for the earth and it\u2019s inhabitants. So instead they all just succumb to their own selfish desires and intentions whiles moving their countries forward in the way they see fit. \n\nI am aware of evil aswell. As I feel there are control groups out there who\u2019s made it their purpose to actually personally elevate themselves to a higher level financially in order to gain a \u201cexclusive and higher end\u201d experience. And others just like to control and manipulate the masses to do as they like. Under the illusion they are serving a government that is suppose to steer the country to something better. Which is a complete lie and illusion. \n\nVery few countries are on the right track in the way they operate and treat the members of their society. And how their society members actually behave and treat eachother. \n\nBut either way. The world is our domain. And should be treated as such. It is foolish to isolate each country from one another and not work with and treat each country as necessary. Heaven isn\u2019t exclusive so why are we? \n\nWe need to simply change our actions and values, dismantle our separation but maintain our cultures. These things are pleasant and memorable. \n\nI strongly believe that the actions we commit are a almost direct reflection of the world around us. As there is no murder in heaven. No violence. \n\nI also strongly believe that this earth is absolutely stunning in beauty and potential to become the best of what we make it. We just need to not be foolish in our development.. as we are now. If we adopt greater ways of thinking and not be so easy to cause conflict. It will be of great use. \n\nI think we allow ourselves to be influenced and learn from negative and destructive/repulsive behaviours and thought patterns that don\u2019t really serve us at all. But during this time we have to because if we do not we will find it hard to function in society. For example. If people weren\u2019t so negatively influenced by society and they were aware of the real condition of the world. And the causes and routes to the issues. They should all have the hearts to rebel. If that were to happen society could crumble if a true and quality leader couldn\u2019t lead properly. \n\nThis is a process though, I feel that we\u2019ve learned a lot through our walk through the dark. But we all know the darkness is scary and violent. And is not nice for anyone besides those who feed from it. Darkness deteriorates life overtime. That\u2019s just how it is.. \n\nIt\u2019s time we step out of that and begin to walk in the light. There is no problem with that. \n\nCavemen once looked into space would never think it\u2019s possible to get up there. Impossible to fly from country to country, couldn\u2019t even think of planes or phones to call anyone anywhere.. they thought one way and we have surpassed them. \n\nWe think one way at this time and we have difficulties aswell.. but it\u2019s just a matter of transcending these things.. just like how we moved on from before with the cavemen. \n\nWe will learn to be better overtime, but we cannot succumb to the temptations of evil. Think about how we will be operating 1000 years in the future, or more. You don\u2019t think we will be thinking differently or have different values? Nah ofc we will. We will be more beneficial.. unless we wanna let these dumbasses takeover and drive us to the doghouse. \n\n- At the end of the day it\u2019s simple. We are our own enemy. And that\u2019s all. Our enemy is our thoughts, emotions, values, and beliefs. Some are there to ultimately be of service, or destruction. The leaders of most nations do not serve anyone. That\u2019s just their front. What they are really doing is bathing in riches and fulfilling their ultimately destructive dreams and goals. And they get others to do they hard work for them and they just pay them a lot of money to continue it. For this reason I couldn\u2019t see any change coming from those kind of people. \n\nAlso politicians are too caught up in bettering their countries that they do not prepare for and research about the war on the world. And build themselves up to become more effective fighters. This prospers one nation maybe, but then the world is in shambles and they are also will be effected by those conditions and repercussions. Overtime making life harder and harder, almost unbearable even. And we would barely even be able to move any further, we will be too caught up in repairing the damage done to x locations and countries including our own. We would have to move people from place to place due to areas being unable to live in from being flooded, fires, and inhospitable areas. Creating cluttering in safe places. Then how do you feed all those people too when your losing land and all these things are happening? \n\nThink about it. These things are already happening. But we do manage to get through it. But what about later when it becomes even more possibly frequent and bigger? We need to make adjustment now because if we do not. We will be too dependant on pollutants, to the point where we would have to let society\u2019s and countries crumble, by abandoning pollutants in order to have a chance at recovery (everyone for themselves). Or we can maintain pollution to foolishly be more \u201ccomfortable\u201d for a time. Whiles being battered harder and harder by the conditions. \n\nEither way those are absolute crap, and crazy choices. But this is why we need to be more serious now and make better choices and decisions now before we get buttplugged ;(. LMAO. \n\nYeah I understand it will take effort and work to do better. But it also take pretty much the same effort and work to do worse. The only difference is that people are so accustomed to doing their jobs and routines it\u2019s easy and natural for them. So making a difference and changing priorities may seem like \u201creal\u201d effort. But effort nonetheless. I hope that\u2019s not the case though. \n\nAnyways. We need a revolution. Convincing word. Or a miracle because we lack major guidance and we have no clue or care about what we are doing or moving towards. \n\nPeople think there\u2019s nothing over the horizon. So why explore? \n \nHere is what goes on in the minds of the most powerful and corrupt men of the world. \n\n1. \u201cGimme gimme gimme now now now!!\u201d - Recieves garbage but they love it \n\n2. \u201cI am an asshole and manipulate others, I degrade myself and hate others because I didn\u2019t experience love or true value for others or myself\u201d \n\n3. \u201cIdc because I\u2019m dying, idc if the world burns\u201d \n\n4. \u201cIdc I want money I\u2019m a greedy monster\u201d \n\n5. \u201c I literally don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing but apparently I\u2019m successful\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how I view the deeper route to Their mentality\u2019s without even knowing them. In all cases its corrupted and destructive. So why are minds like those operating our endeavours, priorities, countries/society\u2019s/world. It\u2019s an equation for destruction. Anyways these people have no right being there, especially considering the fact they literally dictate the quality of our world and life\u2019s. \n\nWe need to think better and more effectively, and use empathy heart values and passions to empower ourselves and be more insightful. Guiding our way so we can prepare for challenges. \n\nLeaders don\u2019t care for that. At this time we need to tackle the real issues and dissolve the fake dramas we created to gain power over one another. I understand that there was no way to tell before the horrible effects of our actions. But now that we do we have to do something about it. \n\nBut as a people we are simply in a stranglehold from evil and corruption. And they wanna choke us out. \n\nYou can grow and learn now in order to become stronger in order to punch them and hit back, doing your part. But you need to have a perspective that is strong enough to knock them out pretty much. Which would take an honest long time to acquire. \n\nI could pretty much smash my knee in their face and k\u2019o them right now. But I don\u2019t have the position or means to atm. We all need to gain strength and become strong to knock them down. But it\u2019s a lot of commitment and purpose. Also everyone has a different set of responsibilities in their lives making them able or unable to complete or commit to different things/tasks unless they are willing to pursue their purpose goal or vision and commit less to the rest of their worries. \n\nIn all help is needed. And we only do the best/most that we can with what we are given. Depending on our mind/body/soul and spirit. \n\nAmen brothers/sisters \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Route To Our Problems And The Solutions\n\nI\u2019ll make this short. \n\nThe root of our problem are our thoughts, values, beliefs, morals, and behaviour. \n\nSociety and our way of life all operate on these things. So if you want a better way of life/society the people need to practice and improve in these areas and not be lazy or full with pride by rejecting this. \n\nLiterally everything on earth for a 100% fact was created by thought and intentions. Then the word was sent, to trigger a reply, then an action was committed to make this thought a reality. This is the gift of manifestation. We all have a hand in creating our lives. You just need to set your sights on what you like and pursue it. \n\nGod is the original architect of creation. And he allows us to participate in his domain. Allowing us and giving us our own dreams and visions that we would like to create. But now this power has been split up over time and handed up to the ill intended and low vibrational people in order to create their own pleasures and not ours. \n\nIf thought creates reality. Why in God\u2019s green earth have we given our powers to manifest reality, and hand majority of that power to people who literally only want to ensue violence and poor favour. Literally all around the world we are allowing people with very poor and corrupted minds to be the front runners of our race. And we can see where this gets us.. \n\nFor example in a world without \u201csin\u201d there world be peace and prosperity. Let\u2019s not talk about all the effects of a world like this because there\u2019s far too much to say. But my point is. We would have manifested completely differently. We would be a very advanced and quickly progressing species, very accepting and loyal to each other. We would honestly probably be exploring all over the universe right now and making awesome things. Finding new planets, looking and creating beauty, who knows, maybe finding new life intelligent or not. In all, it would be dope, earth would be our HQ and like command centres and we would probably colonize other or certain planets, and make impossibilities possible. As we have done before. \n\nSo I\u2019m not going to preach on oh we have to do \u201cthis this and that\u201d, it\u2019s simple. We need to manifest better. We need to make better things and come to better conclusions and make better solutions. There\u2019s literally an answer to everything you can ask. The answer just must be revealed.. through time effort and thought/brainpower. \n\nIt would be the best for leaders of like all nations to actually just drop their pride and step aside so people who are more suited can step in and clean up this mess.. it\u2019s as simple as that. Humans are smart.. a lot of us anyways. And those who are decent know the appropriate direction we need to take in order to move in a better direction. And yes. There is a best path out there. But our current leaders are too blinded by literally their own pride and ego to look and search for it. People think oh think ahead for the future. Our governments are focused on preparing for what they are gonna do now, and within a few following years. This is completely understandable as if they did not how could we operate in the present. But we need think further, or we will be blasted outta orbit. It\u2019s that simple. \n\nNow. What needs to be made is this. We follow the best path, and we do what\u2019s good, right, fair, and just. We will hold ourselves up to our own standards and the standards of God. And we shall not break them. As breaking them will provoke and create or manifest things that are against us. Hatred, violence, corrupted actions and thoughts. These things are destructive and when building something positive and fruitful we don\u2019t need that. \n\nTrolls are fine, trolling is fun but play with people who are thick skinned. Don\u2019t target the weak as they will be damaged and will take long to repair and heal. Maybe never heal too. Not all wounds makes you stronger. It depends on how you respond to pain or trauma. You must have a sense of responsibility when acting and speaking. And try to know how to correct a mistake or bad action. As making mistakes happen in life. We arnt perfect. But it\u2019s how we react and follow through with these mistakes is what really matters. \n\nNow let\u2019s be real. The whole world as it is now is against us. All of us. You. Me. Them. They. Everyone. Even those leading. Those in charge, are actually acting against themselves and they don\u2019t realize it. And it\u2019s because they lack vision and quality\u2019s. They let finite and minuscule things get in the way of better judgement and better ways of thinking and accepting new thought. \n\nAs of right now we are at the bay of the enemy. Who are at the bay of themselves. As we approach the threshold of danger, high danger. We could probably become more and more irritated and rebellious. And we will realize that there is less time to act. But even at this point there will still be barriers in place to contain our wills. There will be people in our way to physically stop us from changing direction/course. And let\u2019s be honest. Even if we find a way to break through their layer of defence. Where then do you go, what do you do, how do u get the bad people to comply. And will we even have the time to salvage what\u2019s left? \n\nIt\u2019s an honest hard task. Taking over by force is absolutely not an option in any case form or issue. Because this is a global threat and disaster. Simply revolting in one country will make very little to no progress. As one country cannot make the impact we need in order to change course. Because then the problems will still be alive in other nations. Which could them view you as a threat to their foolish wishes and power. And you know what could happen after that. \n\nSo really we need to explain our situation. And deviate from it. Collectively as a group. On a common goal. That being - Do what it means to be human, as a reflection of Gods image (a higher standard) and fulfill it. Knowing it holds more and is better for you. For all of us. Leaving nobody. Not even the \u201cbad people\u201d\n\nOur goals need to increase and progress gradually as we complete basic tasks, standards, and necessity\u2019s. That will ensure all of our safety\u2019s. And needs/security. Then we will grow into more complex goals and tasks later as a group one we are more stable and recovered. \n\nFirst what we need to do is - Not only hear, but really and truly listen to other people and understand them. People can scream in your ear and you will never hear or identify the real issue. The route of their pain. That is the key. That is what you must search for and understand and relate to. Then you come to a common ground and conclusion, and move forward together. You can either hold grudges forever. Which is childish and immature. Or you can move past them. Which is a big sign of growth. Now yes you can take your time doing this. \n\nWe need care for love. And look out for eachother. As we are all the same. We all cry to the same pain, and our hearts all align with them same needs and desires. As we all come from the same God. There is a deeper reason as to why we have been separated and have our differences. But it\u2019s not because we ourselves are truly different. We are just unique and share separate quality\u2019s. But we\u2019re all on the same journey. And within us is the same goal and same vision. This is what holds us together as a race. We are just too foolish to realize this. Ofc there are cases of deviants but they probably will serve another purpose one day or now. But if you believe in democracy, then you should listen to all of us. And what we all want is for nobody to suffer and cry. No one to be hurt or impoverished, manipulated or oppressed. Impoverished or malnourished. Nobody should life in ignorance or darkness, and be used lied to and acted wrongly against. These things are FUCKED up. And I will NEVER stand for them. Whether you stand with me or not. \n\nWe are killing each other, torturing the innocent and defenceless. Hell torturing anyone is unacceptable. We have absolutely no morals or standards for anything and anyone. And then we trick ourselves into thinking we do because in our countries there\u2019s food on our plates and roofs over our heads. And that speak for most of us. Oh fuck the rest though. If I can\u2019t see it it\u2019s not my concern. That\u2019s how you treat your lost brothers and sisters. You were conditioned from birth. To operate in a society. And submit to a world which purpose was to destroy you. You were not taught to gain heart and care/love. You weren\u2019t taught to use your immense power and will/passion. You weren\u2019t taught that if you strive for the impossible. It will all bend to your will in the end. \n\nWe were literally born into a world with powers and dominions. Army\u2019s and leaders(corrupt ones). And we\u2019re conditioned to stand on the sidelines and not interfere with their motives. Hell you can try. You can run for leadership but shit. We\u2019re you ever supplied with what is necessary to honestly make a dent in their little game? Fuck no. Born into a society odds are you are in essence very influenced and controlled.. who do you think teaches you and enforced law and creates our cericulms in school? The same government that is corrupted, and uses you. That you are against now after learning these things. You think they will give you the means to dismantle and break their empire they so love? Fuck no dude. They would rather just have you work for them and do their best to strip you of everything you need to find out more and or overcome them. \n\nThat being said. There is a bigger issue at hand here. We can pretty much imagine that the world governments are working hand in hand and creating drama and distractions. And small victories in order to keep us confused and unfocused. As if we all identified the problem. Which we now have. Almost. We could then be able to make them powerless to us essentially. Because they need us. Not we need them. They just want to but as much time as they can in order to make their empire stand until it crushes us. And they don\u2019t give a damn right now either. \n\nSo what do we do? Nothing. Spread this information. And I\u2019ll make more soon. Word is the key. That\u2019s the only way. Unless u want to trigger a major war. No country wants to be blindly overtaken by anyone, they won\u2019t care about what the cause it. It\u2019s an invasion. \n\nWe need to use reason and convince the destructors to essentially diffuse themselves and allow our visions and manifestations override their. As we need it. \n\nNow what does that mean for the future. A lot. But that\u2019s not a big deal. All you need to focus on now is how to get this/these messages across. And the rest will be handled. Always. \n\nSo what are we creating? Hope today, a real future tomorrow. Then incredibilities the next day. And that\u2019s all we need to know. For now. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe plan of our nations - \n\nElect a representative of each nation that will state the ideal goals and direction of their nation. And we will tell them if we will support that. \n\nWe can support anything that isn\u2019t a threat to our future. Or our people. \n\nA planet without life has no meaning. There\u2019s no point to a body, without a soul. We need to prioritize our soul, our lives, over our contraptions and creations. If there is nobody to be amazed by and appreciate your inventions. You have wasted your life and time. \n\nWe can dominate the whole planet, every planet. A universe. But without life what is there to gain? What have we achieved. It would all be lost if no one is there to see it. \n\nOur immediate start needs to be protecting the earth and it\u2019s people. We need to aid the dying earth, and send resources to the people without. \n\nThe simple solution it literally to prioritize ourselves and not our creations. Once we master and perfect that method, everything we create will be for us, and not against us, in short, mid, and long term. We need to take care of all those needs. All of it. And when I say we need to prioritize ourselves. I mean watching damn person on this earth and nobody left behind. Doesn\u2019t matter who they are. Could be the worst most rancid human out there. We won\u2019t treat them like royalty but we won\u2019t destroy them either. Give good people what they are owed. And the bad people only what they need. They may need a beating, time alone, time in bars, generosity, love and care. A whole range of things. But your goals should be to save rather than destroy. Although maybe sometimes you may have to destroy to save. But those are bad odds, not our worry. \n\nOnce we prioritize the health and well-being and states / enjoyments of ourselves. Every atom will bend to our will. Once we are for ourselves. Everything will begin to become for us. You can go fishing without bait, you will die of hunger. You offer nothing to the fish. No promise or effort. You put on the right bait and any fish in the ocean is yours to eat. \n\nWe are given a body and food. But without the right mind we are all dead and will go nowhere. But with the right thoughts and mind. You can achieve anything. \n\nDo not become a victim of your own mind. \n\nWe need stronger minds to lead us. The minds that are more trained and advanced than our own. Minds that have traveled further and accounted for more. Those are the minds that we need in front of us. Or else you will be endlessly bumping into walls. We need a direct path. One that was planned out. If we cannot find that, we are doomed one way or another. \n\nStop killing yourselves. Do not be a victim anymore. Just adopt this. And support life and humanity. This is Revolution. Supporting this is supporting yourself, and your future. \n\nWould you vote Bernie, Revolution, or both?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43542, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Guide to the universe", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561912432, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c71ami/guide_to_the_universe/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "koto234", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_41j559ar", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561824938, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c70yw3/rant_letting_loose_of_control/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c70yw3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c70yw3/rant_letting_loose_of_control/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561824938, "score": 2, "selftext": "so my heart and stomach alrdy hurt because im tryin to hold everything so hard in my hands and try to remain in control of everything. while its long out of my reach. its too much alry to have control over. that causes pain inside.\n\nbut the problem is not only did i forget how to open my heart and just let things happen.\n\nim schizophrenic. and everytime i let loose of control i lose reality. im getting so delusional that its dangerous and im not able to live normal anymore or anyone around me. one time my psychiatrist said it could happen one time that i dont find the way back to sanity. thats why i learned hard to force me to stay in control over me and my tasks.\n\nbut i also dont want to spend my life in deep pain unable to open up.\n\nany thoughts? thanks..", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43540, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[ rant ] letting loose of control", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561911327, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c70yw3/rant_letting_loose_of_control/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "R3volutionzz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2wbm80v9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561824875, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c70y94/guide_to_the_universe/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c70y94", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c70y94/guide_to_the_universe/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561824876, "score": 1, "selftext": "-Guidebook to the universe - (a chance at survival) \n\nThe absolutely key to survival is cooperation between nations. The most extreme efforts of one nation is almost futile when looking at a world scale. We need to stop focusing on profit and start focusing on achievements. Real ones that are beneficial and will help us in the mid - late future. The world is apparently overpopulated as it is. And solving our problems is great. But without preparations we will multiply faster and more people will inhabit the earth before we are ready to handle them. So what will we do with this growing population? It is indefinite that there will be a point where we are simply at capacity. What shall we do then? Inhabit other planets? We seriously need a game plan as to how we move forward before we create more problems for ourselves. We keep switching leaders so often, and nobody is trained to think for the future. If you don\u2019t have someone scouting out the new territory, how do you know it will be safe to enter? How do you know what formation or maneuvers you will take, or what equipment you need or preparations you must make beforehand. \n\nThe way I see it the only reason we should have military is in case of unknown threat ie extraterrestrial invasions etc. But I\u2019d highly doubt that is even plausible. Plus if you take a look at the vastness of space. There are thousands of whole galaxies out there with us, with solar systems of their own with planets etc. There are most likely other beings out there just because of the number of opportunities and potentials in the whole universe. So it\u2019s pretty much up to us to make a story and a happy ending for our planet and race, that we could carry and share with our descendants and maybe other intelligent beings. Or we can succumb and die. We can refuse to change and self destruct. Literally. And it sucks because nobody wants this, but we all support it. And you can\u2019t evade it. The way everything is set up is that we are to dependant on our ways and too comfortable with continuing down this path. Even though it\u2019s one that is completely doomed. We are too comfortable on autopilot, nobody wants to study the course and switch to manual. And fly where we need to go. Not just in a straight line taking damage from all fronts whiles a death timer is on us. \n\nWe need a path manual. A manual for our future. I\u2019ll explain a few things. \n\nWe need a form of population control, or to use our space more effectively. At some point we will be at capacity since we grow in numbers. We grow fast.. we multiply so the rate only increases. We need to be aware of our numbers or be able to keep and maintain growing numbers. That\u2019s all. And of course everyone has an effect on the environment and requires resources. For a lifetime. This needs to be a factor. \n\nAnd that\u2019s all. If you have population control and responsibility your fine. Then you just eliminate your threats. Being climate change, famine, disease, war, and our mindsets. \n\nIt would be wise to control the rate of our growth being that our space is limited. Maybe not now but we should be aware of what time we need to be. If we control our population we can focus on distributing the wealth to everyone according to they needs. And obviously effort as-well. \n\nAs a race we\u2019re just confused as fuck. We\u2019re constantly looking for leaders to lead us. But they only account for the next few years. We need to focus on how we are going to survive and maintain ourselves on earth. How we are going to progress and advance as a species. And how we are going to inhabit other planets like earth hopefully. This planet is our home. And in order to live comfortably Nd safely we need to understand the laws and physics behind it. And us. We need to know the consequences of our thoughts, actions, and choices. And we need to be able to read and know the signs of threats, and rain patterns and things like that. Literally it would be smart to know the patterns of movements and instances before they happen. So you can make calculated predictions before they happen and make the proper arrangements. So you can avoid disasters. All these things are a lot more important than our focuses now. You can only reach your maximum limit. You why limit yourselves to a few years? Why limit yourselves at all? You need to think wayyyy way ahead and that\u2019s where you will go. You can think far, and others will get us through the day to day. Heck. You can do both. You can think far and be prepared for the daily as-well. \nWhen you shoot for a star don\u2019t just shoot blindly. Shoot accurately and shoot within your range. However long that maybe. You will hit it with 100% accuracy. A long as you have that kind of skill. It\u2019s simple. \n\nWe can pass through the destruction, we can pass through these times and we can make it without flaw. But you will never be told the full journey before it happens. You may have a sense. But not the whole scope. My only fear is that the powerful corrupt will not take a liking to my words. Putting us all at risk. As they rather live sweet to die hard/burn. Then to donate and experience greater than they could imagine. \n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n~Religion~\n\nIf our religion was to guide eachother correctly. And receive/listen to the best true word of love, guidance, reason and truth. \n\nOur philosophy was to accept everyone as a vessel for a growing soul, who\u2019s journey and destination was the same as ours. \n\nOur motivation was to bare fruit for each other and ourselves in many ways and techniques that is needed for us to continue happily. (Meaning we all offer our best, and supply a range of things that is needed varrying from entertainments, traditions, philosophies, preparations and plans for future, ideas, supplies and foods, etc) pretty much a diversity of things needed by a lot of different people. We would supply that. \n\nWe can take arm ourselves with important  teachings of wisdom and insight/intentions to arm and better ourselves allowing us to grow into nurturing beings that allows for us to do more. \n\nWe calm our minds and learn to reason and be constructive. Rather than just be ignorant angry and throw people into prisons. People commit crimes because they have nowhere to turn, or do not know how to solve a problem. Or don\u2019t have anyone to solve the issue for them. Souls that are strong and healed or intact do not find the need to commit crimes. Unless they faulted in their own weakness. \n\nOur goal would be to first divide and distribute all basic necessities first to all those in need. We would do the most effective and efficient action in order to supply the needs of others whiles thinking of the course of our future. \n\nOnce basic necessities like food and water are going out. We would should find ways to heal the land again. Stop global warming. And aid the impoverished nations into becoming nations that are moving on their feet. \n\nDuring this time there\u2019s a whole lot of things and activity going on world wide with daily work and affairs. But if we honestly want to do what\u2019s good. This is the better path. But things won\u2019t go word by word according to this of course. This is just the basic fundamentals and ideas to actually recovering and healing our people and planet along with it. \n\nOnce our people are healthy we should focus on advancing medically and technologically. We absolutely need to keep a healthy balance between nature and cities or else our earth will lose its beauty and we will lose resources. We know concrete over all the land will kill us. So we need to make a balance and be aware of the space we use and what we use it for. \n\nAs a person with their needs being taken care of. It\u2019s hard to complain and cause harm anymore. Because there\u2019s no use and it\u2019s very uneeded. So if we supply the needs to others. I feel naturally violence and disturbances will die down. That\u2019s a good thing. \n\nWe are in an ever expanding universe. That\u2019s been around for a long time now.. very very very long. Billions and billions of years or more. Who knows a trillion or more maybe. Space expands fast. There are 10 planets in our solar system. Stars, galaxy\u2019s, comets, planets. Cool stuff for sure. If we don\u2019t want to use our land more responsibly, or keep on increasing in numbers. We will have to have those people be somewhere. \n\nSo colonizing another planet is an option. \n\nBut personally I would say hold on until we can locate or find another earth too. Cus lets be real. Who\u2019s gonna want to live on a planet without life on it. That\u2019s depressing. \n\nIn all. This is the fundamentals of this message to you. That you should consider. \n\n- Treat and care for others as your equal. \n- Think and prepare for the future \n- Be responsible and offer your talents and skills to make life pleasure ful and fruitful\n- Be loving and not selfish\n- Guide one another accordingly and help whenever you can with your thoughts perspectives and ideas\n- Do what makes you happy within boundaries and reason. \n\nThese are some things I would think of. I know for a fact it would be helpful. From here on it\u2019s just up to you and your values and experience to judge wether you agree and like it or not.\n\nLeaders are absolutely necessary in order to run or operate with such numbers of people. Especially living the way we do. But without any preparations for the future I mean cumon. You\u2019d pretty much get to exactly where we are now. A planet with a death sentence. \n\nThis here is a solution. It doesn\u2019t matter who wrote this. What matters is that it\u2019s valid. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis is a piece of a perspective I can view. \n\nWhen I think of the world I see this. I see all majority of countries ran by corrupt governments because they are not capable of envisioning a better future for the earth and it\u2019s inhabitants. So instead they all just succumb to their own selfish desires and intentions whiles moving their countries forward in the way they see fit. \n\nI am aware of evil aswell. As I feel there are control groups out there who\u2019s made it their purpose to actually personally elevate themselves to a higher level financially in order to gain a \u201cexclusive and higher end\u201d experience. And others just like to control and manipulate the masses to do as they like. Under the illusion they are serving a government that is suppose to steer the country to something better. Which is a complete lie and illusion. \n\nVery few countries are on the right track in the way they operate and treat the members of their society. And how their society members actually behave and treat eachother. \n\nBut either way. The world is our domain. And should be treated as such. It is foolish to isolate each country from one another and not work with and treat each country as necessary. Heaven isn\u2019t exclusive so why are we? \n\nWe need to simply change our actions and values, dismantle our separation but maintain our cultures. These things are pleasant and memorable. \n\nI strongly believe that the actions we commit are a almost direct reflection of the world around us. As there is no murder in heaven. No violence. \n\nI also strongly believe that this earth is absolutely stunning in beauty and potential to become the best of what we make it. We just need to not be foolish in our development.. as we are now. If we adopt greater ways of thinking and not be so easy to cause conflict. It will be of great use. \n\nI think we allow ourselves to be influenced and learn from negative and destructive/repulsive behaviours and thought patterns that don\u2019t really serve us at all. But during this time we have to because if we do not we will find it hard to function in society. For example. If people weren\u2019t so negatively influenced by society and they were aware of the real condition of the world. And the causes and routes to the issues. They should all have the hearts to rebel. If that were to happen society could crumble if a true and quality leader couldn\u2019t lead properly. \n\nThis is a process though, I feel that we\u2019ve learned a lot through our walk through the dark. But we all know the darkness is scary and violent. And is not nice for anyone besides those who feed from it. Darkness deteriorates life overtime. That\u2019s just how it is.. \n\nIt\u2019s time we step out of that and begin to walk in the light. There is no problem with that. \n\nCavemen once looked into space would never think it\u2019s possible to get up there. Impossible to fly from country to country, couldn\u2019t even think of planes or phones to call anyone anywhere.. they thought one way and we have surpassed them. \n\nWe think one way at this time and we have difficulties aswell.. but it\u2019s just a matter of transcending these things.. just like how we moved on from before with the cavemen. \n\nWe will learn to be better overtime, but we cannot succumb to the temptations of evil. Think about how we will be operating 1000 years in the future, or more. You don\u2019t think we will be thinking differently or have different values? Nah ofc we will. We will be more beneficial.. unless we wanna let these dumbasses takeover and drive us to the doghouse. \n\n- At the end of the day it\u2019s simple. We are our own enemy. And that\u2019s all. Our enemy is our thoughts, emotions, values, and beliefs. Some are there to ultimately be of service, or destruction. The leaders of most nations do not serve anyone. That\u2019s just their front. What they are really doing is bathing in riches and fulfilling their ultimately destructive dreams and goals. And they get others to do they hard work for them and they just pay them a lot of money to continue it. For this reason I couldn\u2019t see any change coming from those kind of people. \n\nAlso politicians are too caught up in bettering their countries that they do not prepare for and research about the war on the world. And build themselves up to become more effective fighters. This prospers one nation maybe, but then the world is in shambles and they are also will be effected by those conditions and repercussions. Overtime making life harder and harder, almost unbearable even. And we would barely even be able to move any further, we will be too caught up in repairing the damage done to x locations and countries including our own. We would have to move people from place to place due to areas being unable to live in from being flooded, fires, and inhospitable areas. Creating cluttering in safe places. Then how do you feed all those people too when your losing land and all these things are happening? \n\nThink about it. These things are already happening. But we do manage to get through it. But what about later when it becomes even more possibly frequent and bigger? We need to make adjustment now because if we do not. We will be too dependant on pollutants, to the point where we would have to let society\u2019s and countries crumble, by abandoning pollutants in order to have a chance at recovery (everyone for themselves). Or we can maintain pollution to foolishly be more \u201ccomfortable\u201d for a time. Whiles being battered harder and harder by the conditions. \n\nEither way those are absolute crap, and crazy choices. But this is why we need to be more serious now and make better choices and decisions now before we get buttplugged ;(. LMAO. \n\nYeah I understand it will take effort and work to do better. But it also take pretty much the same effort and work to do worse. The only difference is that people are so accustomed to doing their jobs and routines it\u2019s easy and natural for them. So making a difference and changing priorities may seem like \u201creal\u201d effort. But effort nonetheless. I hope that\u2019s not the case though. \n\nAnyways. We need a revolution. Convincing word. Or a miracle because we lack major guidance and we have no clue or care about what we are doing or moving towards. \n\nPeople think there\u2019s nothing over the horizon. So why explore? \n \nHere is what goes on in the minds of the most powerful and corrupt men of the world. \n\n1. \u201cGimme gimme gimme now now now!!\u201d - Recieves garbage but they love it \n\n2. \u201cI am an asshole and manipulate others, I degrade myself and hate others because I didn\u2019t experience love or true value for others or myself\u201d \n\n3. \u201cIdc because I\u2019m dying, idc if the world burns\u201d \n\n4. \u201cIdc I want money I\u2019m a greedy monster\u201d \n\n5. \u201c I literally don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing but apparently I\u2019m successful\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how I view the deeper route to Their mentality\u2019s without even knowing them. In all cases its corrupted and destructive. So why are minds like those operating our endeavours, priorities, countries/society\u2019s/world. It\u2019s an equation for destruction. Anyways these people have no right being there, especially considering the fact they literally dictate the quality of our world and life\u2019s. \n\nWe need to think better and more effectively, and use empathy heart values and passions to empower ourselves and be more insightful. Guiding our way so we can prepare for challenges. \n\nLeaders don\u2019t care for that. At this time we need to tackle the real issues and dissolve the fake dramas we created to gain power over one another. I understand that there was no way to tell before the horrible effects of our actions. But now that we do we have to do something about it. \n\nBut as a people we are simply in a stranglehold from evil and corruption. And they wanna choke us out. \n\nYou can grow and learn now in order to become stronger in order to punch them and hit back, doing your part. But you need to have a perspective that is strong enough to knock them out pretty much. Which would take an honest long time to acquire. \n\nI could pretty much smash my knee in their face and k\u2019o them right now. But I don\u2019t have the position or means to atm. We all need to gain strength and become strong to knock them down. But it\u2019s a lot of commitment and purpose. Also everyone has a different set of responsibilities in their lives making them able or unable to complete or commit to different things/tasks unless they are willing to pursue their purpose goal or vision and commit less to the rest of their worries. \n\nIn all help is needed. And we only do the best/most that we can with what we are given. Depending on our mind/body/soul and spirit. \n\nAmen brothers/sisters \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Route To Our Problems And The Solutions\n\nI\u2019ll make this short. \n\nThe root of our problem are our thoughts, values, beliefs, morals, and behaviour. \n\nSociety and our way of life all operate on these things. So if you want a better way of life/society the people need to practice and improve in these areas and not be lazy or full with pride by rejecting this. \n\nLiterally everything on earth for a 100% fact was created by thought and intentions. Then the word was sent, to trigger a reply, then an action was committed to make this thought a reality. This is the gift of manifestation. We all have a hand in creating our lives. You just need to set your sights on what you like and pursue it. \n\nGod is the original architect of creation. And he allows us to participate in his domain. Allowing us and giving us our own dreams and visions that we would like to create. But now this power has been split up over time and handed up to the ill intended and low vibrational people in order to create their own pleasures and not ours. \n\nIf thought creates reality. Why in God\u2019s green earth have we given our powers to manifest reality, and hand majority of that power to people who literally only want to ensue violence and poor favour. Literally all around the world we are allowing people with very poor and corrupted minds to be the front runners of our race. And we can see where this gets us.. \n\nFor example in a world without \u201csin\u201d there world be peace and prosperity. Let\u2019s not talk about all the effects of a world like this because there\u2019s far too much to say. But my point is. We would have manifested completely differently. We would be a very advanced and quickly progressing species, very accepting and loyal to each other. We would honestly probably be exploring all over the universe right now and making awesome things. Finding new planets, looking and creating beauty, who knows, maybe finding new life intelligent or not. In all, it would be dope, earth would be our HQ and like command centres and we would probably colonize other or certain planets, and make impossibilities possible. As we have done before. \n\nSo I\u2019m not going to preach on oh we have to do \u201cthis this and that\u201d, it\u2019s simple. We need to manifest better. We need to make better things and come to better conclusions and make better solutions. There\u2019s literally an answer to everything you can ask. The answer just must be revealed.. through time effort and thought/brainpower. \n\nIt would be the best for leaders of like all nations to actually just drop their pride and step aside so people who are more suited can step in and clean up this mess.. it\u2019s as simple as that. Humans are smart.. a lot of us anyways. And those who are decent know the appropriate direction we need to take in order to move in a better direction. And yes. There is a best path out there. But our current leaders are too blinded by literally their own pride and ego to look and search for it. People think oh think ahead for the future. Our governments are focused on preparing for what they are gonna do now, and within a few following years. This is completely understandable as if they did not how could we operate in the present. But we need think further, or we will be blasted outta orbit. It\u2019s that simple. \n\nNow. What needs to be made is this. We follow the best path, and we do what\u2019s good, right, fair, and just. We will hold ourselves up to our own standards and the standards of God. And we shall not break them. As breaking them will provoke and create or manifest things that are against us. Hatred, violence, corrupted actions and thoughts. These things are destructive and when building something positive and fruitful we don\u2019t need that. \n\nTrolls are fine, trolling is fun but play with people who are thick skinned. Don\u2019t target the weak as they will be damaged and will take long to repair and heal. Maybe never heal too. Not all wounds makes you stronger. It depends on how you respond to pain or trauma. You must have a sense of responsibility when acting and speaking. And try to know how to correct a mistake or bad action. As making mistakes happen in life. We arnt perfect. But it\u2019s how we react and follow through with these mistakes is what really matters. \n\nNow let\u2019s be real. The whole world as it is now is against us. All of us. You. Me. Them. They. Everyone. Even those leading. Those in charge, are actually acting against themselves and they don\u2019t realize it. And it\u2019s because they lack vision and quality\u2019s. They let finite and minuscule things get in the way of better judgement and better ways of thinking and accepting new thought. \n\nAs of right now we are at the bay of the enemy. Who are at the bay of themselves. As we approach the threshold of danger, high danger. We could probably become more and more irritated and rebellious. And we will realize that there is less time to act. But even at this point there will still be barriers in place to contain our wills. There will be people in our way to physically stop us from changing direction/course. And let\u2019s be honest. Even if we find a way to break through their layer of defence. Where then do you go, what do you do, how do u get the bad people to comply. And will we even have the time to salvage what\u2019s left? \n\nIt\u2019s an honest hard task. Taking over by force is absolutely not an option in any case form or issue. Because this is a global threat and disaster. Simply revolting in one country will make very little to no progress. As one country cannot make the impact we need in order to change course. Because then the problems will still be alive in other nations. Which could them view you as a threat to their foolish wishes and power. And you know what could happen after that. \n\nSo really we need to explain our situation. And deviate from it. Collectively as a group. On a common goal. That being - Do what it means to be human, as a reflection of Gods image (a higher standard) and fulfill it. Knowing it holds more and is better for you. For all of us. Leaving nobody. Not even the \u201cbad people\u201d\n\nOur goals need to increase and progress gradually as we complete basic tasks, standards, and necessity\u2019s. That will ensure all of our safety\u2019s. And needs/security. Then we will grow into more complex goals and tasks later as a group one we are more stable and recovered. \n\nFirst what we need to do is - Not only hear, but really and truly listen to other people and understand them. People can scream in your ear and you will never hear or identify the real issue. The route of their pain. That is the key. That is what you must search for and understand and relate to. Then you come to a common ground and conclusion, and move forward together. You can either hold grudges forever. Which is childish and immature. Or you can move past them. Which is a big sign of growth. Now yes you can take your time doing this. \n\nWe need care for love. And look out for eachother. As we are all the same. We all cry to the same pain, and our hearts all align with them same needs and desires. As we all come from the same God. There is a deeper reason as to why we have been separated and have our differences. But it\u2019s not because we ourselves are truly different. We are just unique and share separate quality\u2019s. But we\u2019re all on the same journey. And within us is the same goal and same vision. This is what holds us together as a race. We are just too foolish to realize this. Ofc there are cases of deviants but they probably will serve another purpose one day or now. But if you believe in democracy, then you should listen to all of us. And what we all want is for nobody to suffer and cry. No one to be hurt or impoverished, manipulated or oppressed. Impoverished or malnourished. Nobody should life in ignorance or darkness, and be used lied to and acted wrongly against. These things are FUCKED up. And I will NEVER stand for them. Whether you stand with me or not. \n\nWe are killing each other, torturing the innocent and defenceless. Hell torturing anyone is unacceptable. We have absolutely no morals or standards for anything and anyone. And then we trick ourselves into thinking we do because in our countries there\u2019s food on our plates and roofs over our heads. And that speak for most of us. Oh fuck the rest though. If I can\u2019t see it it\u2019s not my concern. That\u2019s how you treat your lost brothers and sisters. You were conditioned from birth. To operate in a society. And submit to a world which purpose was to destroy you. You were not taught to gain heart and care/love. You weren\u2019t taught to use your immense power and will/passion. You weren\u2019t taught that if you strive for the impossible. It will all bend to your will in the end. \n\nWe were literally born into a world with powers and dominions. Army\u2019s and leaders(corrupt ones). And we\u2019re conditioned to stand on the sidelines and not interfere with their motives. Hell you can try. You can run for leadership but shit. We\u2019re you ever supplied with what is necessary to honestly make a dent in their little game? Fuck no. Born into a society odds are you are in essence very influenced and controlled.. who do you think teaches you and enforced law and creates our cericulms in school? The same government that is corrupted, and uses you. That you are against now after learning these things. You think they will give you the means to dismantle and break their empire they so love? Fuck no dude. They would rather just have you work for them and do their best to strip you of everything you need to find out more and or overcome them. \n\nThat being said. There is a bigger issue at hand here. We can pretty much imagine that the world governments are working hand in hand and creating drama and distractions. And small victories in order to keep us confused and unfocused. As if we all identified the problem. Which we now have. Almost. We could then be able to make them powerless to us essentially. Because they need us. Not we need them. They just want to but as much time as they can in order to make their empire stand until it crushes us. And they don\u2019t give a damn right now either. \n\nSo what do we do? Nothing. Spread this information. And I\u2019ll make more soon. Word is the key. That\u2019s the only way. Unless u want to trigger a major war. No country wants to be blindly overtaken by anyone, they won\u2019t care about what the cause it. It\u2019s an invasion. \n\nWe need to use reason and convince the destructors to essentially diffuse themselves and allow our visions and manifestations override their. As we need it. \n\nNow what does that mean for the future. A lot. But that\u2019s not a big deal. All you need to focus on now is how to get this/these messages across. And the rest will be handled. Always. \n\nSo what are we creating? Hope today, a real future tomorrow. Then incredibilities the next day. And that\u2019s all we need to know. For now. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe plan of our nations - \n\nElect a representative of each nation that will state the ideal goals and direction of their nation. And we will tell them if we will support that. \n\nWe can support anything that isn\u2019t a threat to our future. Or our people. \n\nA planet without life has no meaning. There\u2019s no point to a body, without a soul. We need to prioritize our soul, our lives, over our contraptions and creations. If there is nobody to be amazed by and appreciate your inventions. You have wasted your life and time. \n\nWe can dominate the whole planet, every planet. A universe. But without life what is there to gain? What have we achieved. It would all be lost if no one is there to see it. \n\nOur immediate start needs to be protecting the earth and it\u2019s people. We need to aid the dying earth, and send resources to the people without. \n\nThe simple solution it literally to prioritize ourselves and not our creations. Once we master and perfect that method, everything we create will be for us, and not against us, in short, mid, and long term. We need to take care of all those needs. All of it. And when I say we need to prioritize ourselves. I mean watching damn person on this earth and nobody left behind. Doesn\u2019t matter who they are. Could be the worst most rancid human out there. We won\u2019t treat them like royalty but we won\u2019t destroy them either. Give good people what they are owed. And the bad people only what they need. They may need a beating, time alone, time in bars, generosity, love and care. A whole range of things. But your goals should be to save rather than destroy. Although maybe sometimes you may have to destroy to save. But those are bad odds, not our worry. \n\nOnce we prioritize the health and well-being and states / enjoyments of ourselves. Every atom will bend to our will. Once we are for ourselves. Everything will begin to become for us. You can go fishing without bait, you will die of hunger. You offer nothing to the fish. No promise or effort. You put on the right bait and any fish in the ocean is yours to eat. \n\nWe are given a body and food. But without the right mind we are all dead and will go nowhere. But with the right thoughts and mind. You can achieve anything. \n\nDo not become a victim of your own mind. \n\nWe need stronger minds to lead us. The minds that are more trained and advanced than our own. Minds that have traveled further and accounted for more. Those are the minds that we need in front of us. Or else you will be endlessly bumping into walls. We need a direct path. One that was planned out. If we cannot find that, we are doomed one way or another. \n\nStop killing yourselves. Do not be a victim anymore. Just adopt this. And support life and humanity. This is Revolution. Supporting this is supporting yourself, and your future. \n\nWould you vote Bernie, Revolution, or both?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43540, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Guide to the universe", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561911266, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c70y94/guide_to_the_universe/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "shickari", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_t8810", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561824138, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c70q6r/real_love_is_terrifying_to_those_who_have_never/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c70q6r", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "ff48d9ae-c323-11e7-bd5d-0e515489cb82", "link_flair_text": "Relationships", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 41, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c70q6r/real_love_is_terrifying_to_those_who_have_never/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561824139, "score": 80, "selftext": "When love is real and good, it can be very scary to those who have never had it. \n\nIt\u2019s pure light feels so good that it might cause those who have been hurt to runaway, because they fear what happens if the principle of rhythm takes them back the other way.\n\nWhat happens if love turns out to be not real? \n\nAfter all, it has seemingly happened in the past...\n\nThat love would fall away.\n\nThat they would be abandoned.\n\nBut real love remains anchored and sees the other person for who they really are:\n\nAn immortal being of light.\n\nNot only worthy of all love, but love incarnate.\n\nThis is the seat of miracles.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43538, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Real Love is terrifying to those who have never had it...", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561910526, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c70q6r/real_love_is_terrifying_to_those_who_have_never/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "R3volutionzz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2wbm80v9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561823178, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c70fyt/the_guide_to_the_universe_a_chance_at_survival/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c70fyt", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c70fyt/the_guide_to_the_universe_a_chance_at_survival/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561823179, "score": 1, "selftext": "-Guidebook to the universe - (a chance at survival) \n\nThe absolute key to survival is cooperation between nations. The most extreme efforts of one nation is almost futile when looking at a world scale. We need to stop focusing on profit and start focusing on achievements. Real ones that are beneficial and will help us in the mid - late future. The world is apparently overpopulated as it is. And solving our problems is great. But without preparations we will multiply faster and more people will inhabit the earth before we are ready to handle them. So what will we do with this growing population? It is indefinite that there will be a point where we are simply at capacity. What shall we do then? Inhabit other planets? We seriously need a game plan as to how we move forward before we create more problems for ourselves. We keep switching leaders so often, and nobody is trained to think for the future. If you don\u2019t have someone scouting out the new territory, how do you know it will be safe to enter? How do you know what formation or maneuvers you will take, or what equipment you need or preparations you must make beforehand. \n\nThe way I see it the only reason we should have military is in case of unknown threat ie extraterrestrial invasions etc. But I\u2019d highly doubt that is even plausible. Plus if you take a look at the vastness of space. There are thousands of whole galaxies out there with us, with solar systems of their own with planets etc. There are most likely other beings out there just because of the number of opportunities and potentials in the whole universe. So it\u2019s pretty much up to us to make a story and a happy ending for our planet and race, that we could carry and share with our descendants and maybe other intelligent beings. Or we can succumb and die. We can refuse to change and self destruct. Literally. And it sucks because nobody wants this, but we all support it. And you can\u2019t evade it. The way everything is set up is that we are to dependant on our ways and too comfortable with continuing down this path. Even though it\u2019s one that is completely doomed. We are too comfortable on autopilot, nobody wants to study the course and switch to manual. And fly where we need to go. Not just in a straight line taking damage from all fronts whiles a death timer is on us. \n\nWe need a path manual. A manual for our future. I\u2019ll explain a few things. \n\nWe need a form of population control, or to use our space more effectively. At some point we will be at capacity since we grow in numbers. We grow fast.. we multiply so the rate only increases. We need to be aware of our numbers or be able to keep and maintain growing numbers. That\u2019s all. And of course everyone has an effect on the environment and requires resources. For a lifetime. This needs to be a factor. \n\nAnd that\u2019s all. If you have population control and responsibility your fine. Then you just eliminate your threats. Being climate change, famine, disease, war, and our mindsets. \n\nIt would be wise to control the rate of our growth being that our space is limited. Maybe not now but we should be aware of what time we need to be. If we control our population we can focus on distributing the wealth to everyone according to they needs. And obviously effort as-well. \n\nAs a race we\u2019re just confused as fuck. We\u2019re constantly looking for leaders to lead us. But they only account for the next few years. We need to focus on how we are going to survive and maintain ourselves on earth. How we are going to progress and advance as a species. And how we are going to inhabit other planets like earth hopefully. This planet is our home. And in order to live comfortably Nd safely we need to understand the laws and physics behind it. And us. We need to know the consequences of our thoughts, actions, and choices. And we need to be able to read and know the signs of threats, and rain patterns and things like that. Literally it would be smart to know the patterns of movements and instances before they happen. So you can make calculated predictions before they happen and make the proper arrangements. So you can avoid disasters. All these things are a lot more important than our focuses now. You can only reach your maximum limit. You why limit yourselves to a few years? Why limit yourselves at all? You need to think wayyyy way ahead and that\u2019s where you will go. You can think far, and others will get us through the day to day. Heck. You can do both. You can think far and be prepared for the daily as-well. \nWhen you shoot for a star don\u2019t just shoot blindly. Shoot accurately and shoot within your range. However long that maybe. You will hit it with 100% accuracy. A long as you have that kind of skill. It\u2019s simple. \n\nWe can pass through the destruction, we can pass through these times and we can make it without flaw. But you will never be told the full journey before it happens. You may have a sense. But not the whole scope. My only fear is that the powerful corrupt will not take a liking to my words. Putting us all at risk. As they rather live sweet to die hard/burn. Then to donate and experience greater than they could imagine. \n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n~Religion~\n\nIf our religion was to guide eachother correctly. And receive/listen to the best true word of love, guidance, reason and truth. \n\nOur philosophy was to accept everyone as a vessel for a growing soul, who\u2019s journey and destination was the same as ours. \n\nOur motivation was to bare fruit for each other and ourselves in many ways and techniques that is needed for us to continue happily. (Meaning we all offer our best, and supply a range of things that is needed varrying from entertainments, traditions, philosophies, preparations and plans for future, ideas, supplies and foods, etc) pretty much a diversity of things needed by a lot of different people. We would supply that. \n\nWe can take arm ourselves with important  teachings of wisdom and insight/intentions to arm and better ourselves allowing us to grow into nurturing beings that allows for us to do more. \n\nWe calm our minds and learn to reason and be constructive. Rather than just be ignorant angry and throw people into prisons. People commit crimes because they have nowhere to turn, or do not know how to solve a problem. Or don\u2019t have anyone to solve the issue for them. Souls that are strong and healed or intact do not find the need to commit crimes. Unless they faulted in their own weakness. \n\nOur goal would be to first divide and distribute all basic necessities first to all those in need. We would do the most effective and efficient action in order to supply the needs of others whiles thinking of the course of our future. \n\nOnce basic necessities like food and water are going out. We would should find ways to heal the land again. Stop global warming. And aid the impoverished nations into becoming nations that are moving on their feet. \n\nDuring this time there\u2019s a whole lot of things and activity going on world wide with daily work and affairs. But if we honestly want to do what\u2019s good. This is the better path. But things won\u2019t go word by word according to this of course. This is just the basic fundamentals and ideas to actually recovering and healing our people and planet along with it. \n\nOnce our people are healthy we should focus on advancing medically and technologically. We absolutely need to keep a healthy balance between nature and cities or else our earth will lose its beauty and we will lose resources. We know concrete over all the land will kill us. So we need to make a balance and be aware of the space we use and what we use it for. \n\nAs a person with their needs being taken care of. It\u2019s hard to complain and cause harm anymore. Because there\u2019s no use and it\u2019s very uneeded. So if we supply the needs to others. I feel naturally violence and disturbances will die down. That\u2019s a good thing. \n\nWe are in an ever expanding universe. That\u2019s been around for a long time now.. very very very long. Billions and billions of years or more. Who knows a trillion or more maybe. Space expands fast. There are 10 planets in our solar system. Stars, galaxy\u2019s, comets, planets. Cool stuff for sure. If we don\u2019t want to use our land more responsibly, or keep on increasing in numbers. We will have to have those people be somewhere. \n\nSo colonizing another planet is an option. \n\nBut personally I would say hold on until we can locate or find another earth too. Cus lets be real. Who\u2019s gonna want to live on a planet without life on it. That\u2019s depressing. \n\nIn all. This is the fundamentals of this message to you. That you should consider. \n\n- Treat and care for others as your equal. \n- Think and prepare for the future \n- Be responsible and offer your talents and skills to make life pleasure ful and fruitful\n- Be loving and not selfish\n- Guide one another accordingly and help whenever you can with your thoughts perspectives and ideas\n- Do what makes you happy within boundaries and reason. \n\nThese are some things I would think of. I know for a fact it would be helpful. From here on it\u2019s just up to you and your values and experience to judge wether you agree and like it or not.\n\nLeaders are absolutely necessary in order to run or operate with such numbers of people. Especially living the way we do. But without any preparations for the future I mean cumon. You\u2019d pretty much get to exactly where we are now. A planet with a death sentence. \n\nThis here is a solution. It doesn\u2019t matter who wrote this. What matters is that it\u2019s valid. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis is a piece of a perspective I can view. \n\nWhen I think of the world I see this. I see all majority of countries ran by corrupt governments because they are not capable of envisioning a better future for the earth and it\u2019s inhabitants. So instead they all just succumb to their own selfish desires and intentions whiles moving their countries forward in the way they see fit. \n\nI am aware of evil aswell. As I feel there are control groups out there who\u2019s made it their purpose to actually personally elevate themselves to a higher level financially in order to gain a \u201cexclusive and higher end\u201d experience. And others just like to control and manipulate the masses to do as they like. Under the illusion they are serving a government that is suppose to steer the country to something better. Which is a complete lie and illusion. \n\nVery few countries are on the right track in the way they operate and treat the members of their society. And how their society members actually behave and treat eachother. \n\nBut either way. The world is our domain. And should be treated as such. It is foolish to isolate each country from one another and not work with and treat each country as necessary. Heaven isn\u2019t exclusive so why are we? \n\nWe need to simply change our actions and values, dismantle our separation but maintain our cultures. These things are pleasant and memorable. \n\nI strongly believe that the actions we commit are a almost direct reflection of the world around us. As there is no murder in heaven. No violence. \n\nI also strongly believe that this earth is absolutely stunning in beauty and potential to become the best of what we make it. We just need to not be foolish in our development.. as we are now. If we adopt greater ways of thinking and not be so easy to cause conflict. It will be of great use. \n\nI think we allow ourselves to be influenced and learn from negative and destructive/repulsive behaviours and thought patterns that don\u2019t really serve us at all. But during this time we have to because if we do not we will find it hard to function in society. For example. If people weren\u2019t so negatively influenced by society and they were aware of the real condition of the world. And the causes and routes to the issues. They should all have the hearts to rebel. If that were to happen society could crumble if a true and quality leader couldn\u2019t lead properly. \n\nThis is a process though, I feel that we\u2019ve learned a lot through our walk through the dark. But we all know the darkness is scary and violent. And is not nice for anyone besides those who feed from it. Darkness deteriorates life overtime. That\u2019s just how it is.. \n\nIt\u2019s time we step out of that and begin to walk in the light. There is no problem with that. \n\nCavemen once looked into space would never think it\u2019s possible to get up there. Impossible to fly from country to country, couldn\u2019t even think of planes or phones to call anyone anywhere.. they thought one way and we have surpassed them. \n\nWe think one way at this time and we have difficulties aswell.. but it\u2019s just a matter of transcending these things.. just like how we moved on from before with the cavemen. \n\nWe will learn to be better overtime, but we cannot succumb to the temptations of evil. Think about how we will be operating 1000 years in the future, or more. You don\u2019t think we will be thinking differently or have different values? Nah ofc we will. We will be more beneficial.. unless we wanna let these dumbasses takeover and drive us to the doghouse. \n\n- At the end of the day it\u2019s simple. We are our own enemy. And that\u2019s all. Our enemy is our thoughts, emotions, values, and beliefs. Some are there to ultimately be of service, or destruction. The leaders of most nations do not serve anyone. That\u2019s just their front. What they are really doing is bathing in riches and fulfilling their ultimately destructive dreams and goals. And they get others to do they hard work for them and they just pay them a lot of money to continue it. For this reason I couldn\u2019t see any change coming from those kind of people. \n\nAlso politicians are too caught up in bettering their countries that they do not prepare for and research about the war on the world. And build themselves up to become more effective fighters. This prospers one nation maybe, but then the world is in shambles and they are also will be effected by those conditions and repercussions. Overtime making life harder and harder, almost unbearable even. And we would barely even be able to move any further, we will be too caught up in repairing the damage done to x locations and countries including our own. We would have to move people from place to place due to areas being unable to live in from being flooded, fires, and inhospitable areas. Creating cluttering in safe places. Then how do you feed all those people too when your losing land and all these things are happening? \n\nThink about it. These things are already happening. But we do manage to get through it. But what about later when it becomes even more possibly frequent and bigger? We need to make adjustment now because if we do not. We will be too dependant on pollutants, to the point where we would have to let society\u2019s and countries crumble, by abandoning pollutants in order to have a chance at recovery (everyone for themselves). Or we can maintain pollution to foolishly be more \u201ccomfortable\u201d for a time. Whiles being battered harder and harder by the conditions. \n\nEither way those are absolute crap, and crazy choices. But this is why we need to be more serious now and make better choices and decisions now before we get buttplugged ;(. LMAO. \n\nYeah I understand it will take effort and work to do better. But it also take pretty much the same effort and work to do worse. The only difference is that people are so accustomed to doing their jobs and routines it\u2019s easy and natural for them. So making a difference and changing priorities may seem like \u201creal\u201d effort. But effort nonetheless. I hope that\u2019s not the case though. \n\nAnyways. We need a revolution. Convincing word. Or a miracle because we lack major guidance and we have no clue or care about what we are doing or moving towards. \n\nPeople think there\u2019s nothing over the horizon. So why explore? \n \nHere is what goes on in the minds of the most powerful and corrupt men of the world. \n\n1. \u201cGimme gimme gimme now now now!!\u201d - Recieves garbage but they love it \n\n2. \u201cI am an asshole and manipulate others, I degrade myself and hate others because I didn\u2019t experience love or true value for others or myself\u201d \n\n3. \u201cIdc because I\u2019m dying, idc if the world burns\u201d \n\n4. \u201cIdc I want money I\u2019m a greedy monster\u201d \n\n5. \u201c I literally don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing but apparently I\u2019m successful\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how I view the deeper route to Their mentality\u2019s without even knowing them. In all cases its corrupted and destructive. So why are minds like those operating our endeavours, priorities, countries/society\u2019s/world. It\u2019s an equation for destruction. Anyways these people have no right being there, especially considering the fact they literally dictate the quality of our world and life\u2019s. \n\nWe need to think better and more effectively, and use empathy heart values and passions to empower ourselves and be more insightful. Guiding our way so we can prepare for challenges. \n\nLeaders don\u2019t care for that. At this time we need to tackle the real issues and dissolve the fake dramas we created to gain power over one another. I understand that there was no way to tell before the horrible effects of our actions. But now that we do we have to do something about it. \n\nBut as a people we are simply in a stranglehold from evil and corruption. And they wanna choke us out. \n\nYou can grow and learn now in order to become stronger in order to punch them and hit back, doing your part. But you need to have a perspective that is strong enough to knock them out pretty much. Which would take an honest long time to acquire. \n\nI could pretty much smash my knee in their face and k\u2019o them right now. But I don\u2019t have the position or means to atm. We all need to gain strength and become strong to knock them down. But it\u2019s a lot of commitment and purpose. Also everyone has a different set of responsibilities in their lives making them able or unable to complete or commit to different things/tasks unless they are willing to pursue their purpose goal or vision and commit less to the rest of their worries. \n\nIn all help is needed. And we only do the best/most that we can with what we are given. Depending on our mind/body/soul and spirit. \n\nAmen brothers/sisters \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Route To Our Problems And The Solutions\n\nI\u2019ll make this short. \n\nThe root of our problem are our thoughts, values, beliefs, morals, and behaviour. \n\nSociety and our way of life all operate on these things. So if you want a better way of life/society the people need to practice and improve in these areas and not be lazy or full with pride by rejecting this. \n\nLiterally everything on earth for a 100% fact was created by thought and intentions. Then the word was sent, to trigger a reply, then an action was committed to make this thought a reality. This is the gift of manifestation. We all have a hand in creating our lives. You just need to set your sights on what you like and pursue it. \n\nGod is the original architect of creation. And he allows us to participate in his domain. Allowing us and giving us our own dreams and visions that we would like to create. But now this power has been split up over time and handed up to the ill intended and low vibrational people in order to create their own pleasures and not ours. \n\nIf thought creates reality. Why in God\u2019s green earth have we given our powers to manifest reality, and hand majority of that power to people who literally only want to ensue violence and poor favour. Literally all around the world we are allowing people with very poor and corrupted minds to be the front runners of our race. And we can see where this gets us.. \n\nFor example in a world without \u201csin\u201d there world be peace and prosperity. Let\u2019s not talk about all the effects of a world like this because there\u2019s far too much to say. But my point is. We would have manifested completely differently. We would be a very advanced and quickly progressing species, very accepting and loyal to each other. We would honestly probably be exploring all over the universe right now and making awesome things. Finding new planets, looking and creating beauty, who knows, maybe finding new life intelligent or not. In all, it would be dope, earth would be our HQ and like command centres and we would probably colonize other or certain planets, and make impossibilities possible. As we have done before. \n\nSo I\u2019m not going to preach on oh we have to do \u201cthis this and that\u201d, it\u2019s simple. We need to manifest better. We need to make better things and come to better conclusions and make better solutions. There\u2019s literally an answer to everything you can ask. The answer just must be revealed.. through time effort and thought/brainpower. \n\nIt would be the best for leaders of like all nations to actually just drop their pride and step aside so people who are more suited can step in and clean up this mess.. it\u2019s as simple as that. Humans are smart.. a lot of us anyways. And those who are decent know the appropriate direction we need to take in order to move in a better direction. And yes. There is a best path out there. But our current leaders are too blinded by literally their own pride and ego to look and search for it. People think oh think ahead for the future. Our governments are focused on preparing for what they are gonna do now, and within a few following years. This is completely understandable as if they did not how could we operate in the present. But we need think further, or we will be blasted outta orbit. It\u2019s that simple. \n\nNow. What needs to be made is this. We follow the best path, and we do what\u2019s good, right, fair, and just. We will hold ourselves up to our own standards and the standards of God. And we shall not break them. As breaking them will provoke and create or manifest things that are against us. Hatred, violence, corrupted actions and thoughts. These things are destructive and when building something positive and fruitful we don\u2019t need that. \n\nTrolls are fine, trolling is fun but play with people who are thick skinned. Don\u2019t target the weak as they will be damaged and will take long to repair and heal. Maybe never heal too. Not all wounds makes you stronger. It depends on how you respond to pain or trauma. You must have a sense of responsibility when acting and speaking. And try to know how to correct a mistake or bad action. As making mistakes happen in life. We arnt perfect. But it\u2019s how we react and follow through with these mistakes is what really matters. \n\nNow let\u2019s be real. The whole world as it is now is against us. All of us. You. Me. Them. They. Everyone. Even those leading. Those in charge, are actually acting against themselves and they don\u2019t realize it. And it\u2019s because they lack vision and quality\u2019s. They let finite and minuscule things get in the way of better judgement and better ways of thinking and accepting new thought. \n\nAs of right now we are at the bay of the enemy. Who are at the bay of themselves. As we approach the threshold of danger, high danger. We could probably become more and more irritated and rebellious. And we will realize that there is less time to act. But even at this point there will still be barriers in place to contain our wills. There will be people in our way to physically stop us from changing direction/course. And let\u2019s be honest. Even if we find a way to break through their layer of defence. Where then do you go, what do you do, how do u get the bad people to comply. And will we even have the time to salvage what\u2019s left? \n\nIt\u2019s an honest hard task. Taking over by force is absolutely not an option in any case form or issue. Because this is a global threat and disaster. Simply revolting in one country will make very little to no progress. As one country cannot make the impact we need in order to change course. Because then the problems will still be alive in other nations. Which could them view you as a threat to their foolish wishes and power. And you know what could happen after that. \n\nSo really we need to explain our situation. And deviate from it. Collectively as a group. On a common goal. That being - Do what it means to be human, as a reflection of Gods image (a higher standard) and fulfill it. Knowing it holds more and is better for you. For all of us. Leaving nobody. Not even the \u201cbad people\u201d\n\nOur goals need to increase and progress gradually as we complete basic tasks, standards, and necessity\u2019s. That will ensure all of our safety\u2019s. And needs/security. Then we will grow into more complex goals and tasks later as a group one we are more stable and recovered. \n\nFirst what we need to do is - Not only hear, but really and truly listen to other people and understand them. People can scream in your ear and you will never hear or identify the real issue. The route of their pain. That is the key. That is what you must search for and understand and relate to. Then you come to a common ground and conclusion, and move forward together. You can either hold grudges forever. Which is childish and immature. Or you can move past them. Which is a big sign of growth. Now yes you can take your time doing this. \n\nWe need care for love. And look out for eachother. As we are all the same. We all cry to the same pain, and our hearts all align with them same needs and desires. As we all come from the same God. There is a deeper reason as to why we have been separated and have our differences. But it\u2019s not because we ourselves are truly different. We are just unique and share separate quality\u2019s. But we\u2019re all on the same journey. And within us is the same goal and same vision. This is what holds us together as a race. We are just too foolish to realize this. Ofc there are cases of deviants but they probably will serve another purpose one day or now. But if you believe in democracy, then you should listen to all of us. And what we all want is for nobody to suffer and cry. No one to be hurt or impoverished, manipulated or oppressed. Impoverished or malnourished. Nobody should life in ignorance or darkness, and be used lied to and acted wrongly against. These things are FUCKED up. And I will NEVER stand for them. Whether you stand with me or not. \n\nWe are killing each other, torturing the innocent and defenceless. Hell torturing anyone is unacceptable. We have absolutely no morals or standards for anything and anyone. And then we trick ourselves into thinking we do because in our countries there\u2019s food on our plates and roofs over our heads. And that speak for most of us. Oh fuck the rest though. If I can\u2019t see it it\u2019s not my concern. That\u2019s how you treat your lost brothers and sisters. You were conditioned from birth. To operate in a society. And submit to a world which purpose was to destroy you. You were not taught to gain heart and care/love. You weren\u2019t taught to use your immense power and will/passion. You weren\u2019t taught that if you strive for the impossible. It will all bend to your will in the end. \n\nWe were literally born into a world with powers and dominions. Army\u2019s and leaders(corrupt ones). And we\u2019re conditioned to stand on the sidelines and not interfere with their motives. Hell you can try. You can run for leadership but shit. We\u2019re you ever supplied with what is necessary to honestly make a dent in their little game? Fuck no. Born into a society odds are you are in essence very influenced and controlled.. who do you think teaches you and enforced law and creates our cericulms in school? The same government that is corrupted, and uses you. That you are against now after learning these things. You think they will give you the means to dismantle and break their empire they so love? Fuck no dude. They would rather just have you work for them and do their best to strip you of everything you need to find out more and or overcome them. \n\nThat being said. There is a bigger issue at hand here. We can pretty much imagine that the world governments are working hand in hand and creating drama and distractions. And small victories in order to keep us confused and unfocused. As if we all identified the problem. Which we now have. Almost. We could then be able to make them powerless to us essentially. Because they need us. Not we need them. They just want to but as much time as they can in order to make their empire stand until it crushes us. And they don\u2019t give a damn right now either. \n\nSo what do we do? Nothing. Spread this information. And I\u2019ll make more soon. Word is the key. That\u2019s the only way. Unless u want to trigger a major war. No country wants to be blindly overtaken by anyone, they won\u2019t care about what the cause it. It\u2019s an invasion. \n\nWe need to use reason and convince the destructors to essentially diffuse themselves and allow our visions and manifestations override their. As we need it. \n\nNow what does that mean for the future. A lot. But that\u2019s not a big deal. All you need to focus on now is how to get this/these messages across. And the rest will be handled. Always. \n\nSo what are we creating? Hope today, a real future tomorrow. Then incredibilities the next day. And that\u2019s all we need to know. For now. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe plan of our nations - \n\nElect a representative of each nation that will state the ideal goals and direction of their nation. And we will tell them if we will support that. \n\nWe can support anything that isn\u2019t a threat to our future. Or our people. \n\nA planet without life has no meaning. There\u2019s no point to a body, without a soul. We need to prioritize our soul, our lives, over our contraptions and creations. If there is nobody to be amazed by and appreciate your inventions. You have wasted your life and time. \n\nWe can dominate the whole planet, every planet. A universe. But without life what is there to gain? What have we achieved. It would all be lost if no one is there to see it. \n\nOur immediate start needs to be protecting the earth and it\u2019s people. We need to aid the dying earth, and send resources to the people without. \n\nThe simple solution it literally to prioritize ourselves and not our creations. Once we master and perfect that method, everything we create will be for us, and not against us, in short, mid, and long term. We need to take care of all those needs. All of it. And when I say we need to prioritize ourselves. I mean watching damn person on this earth and nobody left behind. Doesn\u2019t matter who they are. Could be the worst most rancid human out there. We won\u2019t treat them like royalty but we won\u2019t destroy them either. Give good people what they are owed. And the bad people only what they need. They may need a beating, time alone, time in bars, generosity, love and care. A whole range of things. But your goals should be to save rather than destroy. Although maybe sometimes you may have to destroy to save. But those are bad odds, not our worry. \n\nOnce we prioritize the health and well-being and states / enjoyments of ourselves. Every atom will bend to our will. Once we are for ourselves. Everything will begin to become for us. You can go fishing without bait, you will die of hunger. You offer nothing to the fish. No promise or effort. You put on the right bait and any fish in the ocean is yours to eat. \n\nWe are given a body and food. But without the right mind we are all dead and will go nowhere. But with the right thoughts and mind. You can achieve anything. \n\nDo not become a victim of your own mind. \n\nWe need stronger minds to lead us. The minds that are more trained and advanced than our own. Minds that have traveled further and accounted for more. Those are the minds that we need in front of us. Or else you will be endlessly bumping into walls. We need a direct path. One that was planned out. If we cannot find that, we are doomed one way or another. \n\nStop killing yourselves. Do not be a victim anymore. Just adopt this. And support life and humanity. This is Revolution. Supporting this is supporting yourself, and your future. \n\nWould you vote Bernie, Revolution, or both?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43537, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The guide to the universe (a chance at survival)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561909564, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c70fyt/the_guide_to_the_universe_a_chance_at_survival/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "Philosopher-Newport", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3lys2c0h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561814966, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c6yyls/the_ultimate_truth_philosopher_newport/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c6yyls", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "a73e23e6-841b-11e7-95a2-0ec544fa7318", "link_flair_text": "Video", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c6yyls/the_ultimate_truth_philosopher_newport/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "U55E_WF91OY46FVgPqDWxxLCexRhiNadQKtHtzCjMf0", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/E3sJP1_X3zAeG-bxMwEpqlIsXDFq8r5rfzzhdizcdts.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f442a8903fd4039a11e19687f8e25b07a422a96", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/E3sJP1_X3zAeG-bxMwEpqlIsXDFq8r5rfzzhdizcdts.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e438c8896cf7f73295b586d1d58a71daeb02e5f", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/E3sJP1_X3zAeG-bxMwEpqlIsXDFq8r5rfzzhdizcdts.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21dac3108fc1a0ee668bbc9c6df37c9f5ecec4a3", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/E3sJP1_X3zAeG-bxMwEpqlIsXDFq8r5rfzzhdizcdts.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d757b7660eafe52cc87d0fd0d3cef917352a354e", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1561814968, "score": 5, "selftext": "You had freewill before the Big Bang to conceive &amp; script this temporary, physical existence.

I can recognize someone I haven\u2019t seen in many years, but not conjure a clear image of my partner\u2019s face. Interestingly, I still dream normally.\n\nMany meditation techniques I have tried have focused on the ability to visualize. I can keep up, but it\u2019s a struggle and I think I can find more effective techniques now that I understand why it was a struggle. So...\n\nDo any of you share this experience?

I've been reading parts of the Bhagavad Gita, and many times Krshna is referred to as \"the causality of all causality\", which I found interesting since they also call him the Lord or Godhead. I'm attracted to this idea that causality = Godliness, since I strongly believe that humans keep making the mistake of treating God as something with a human personality. I love the idea that God is just the ongoing causality around us, but because it gives birth to us and everything that is, it has this maternal side to it when our human minds tap into its power. So let me argue for why I believe there is only one causality in the universe, and why that's so significant. \n\nThe idea of separate \"causal agents\" is a very human flaw in understanding. We like to reduce an experiment down to one perceived cause because it reassures us that the universe can be quantified. So we attempt to isolate a drug during a trial and call it a separate \"causal agent\". Yet if we start to really examine causality, the concept of individual agents falls apart, since each causal agents can be broken down to its infinite composite parts, and each those parts could be called its own causal agent. So we can think of the universe as being made of infinitely-small causal agents, which can be represented as (1/ \u221e );1 broken up into infinite parts. Then consider that there are infinitely many of these infinitely small agents. The infinities cancel: (1/ \u221e ) x \u221e = 1. \n\nWith the easy-to-accept basis that each casual agent can be broken into infinitely smaller causal agents, we've proven that there's only one causality in the universe. Each thing is so interconnected with the web of causality that it is ultimately inseparable. This validates to me the concept of \"oneness with the universe\". You are literally so much a part of the ongoing causality around you that you are inseparable from it. We like to point to the physical boundaries of our bodies to prove that we are separate, but this assumes that the physical orientation of something is its defining characteristic. It seems to me that the place in causality is a more multi-dimensional approach to defining ourselves, yet we've just shown that there is no individual in this perspective. Furthermore, if causality = Godliness, then our being part of causality makes us part of Godliness. Despite our scale and position in the universe, we are as infinitely significant as every other component of our reality, since all work together to create a single fabric of causality. It also makes perfect sense to call this interconnecting fact God, doesn't it?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43488, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The total number of causalities in the universe = 1", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561863529, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c6tl4q/the_total_number_of_causalities_in_the_universe_1/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "ChaosFlame72", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2h1uc4w0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561771492, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c6snir/chakra/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c6snir", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c6snir/chakra/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561771494, "score": 13, "selftext": "How do I unblock my chakras ?

Have a great 120 hours, may you all find the true distraction from your life cause you have no true purpose to be alive. \n\nYou use your everyday power to tell me, you have a purpose. This world is a purpose, but what you believe in is your purpose, that's your ego, not what the world purpose.\n\nWorld purpose is for each and all to work together to create harmony, but \n\nDon't use your kids, your job, your ego. Or your plans to tell me that's your purpose. Everything is a matter of perspective, but tell me. How many kids from all over the world have a purpose? purpose to be alive, cared, acknowledge, praise. \n\nWhat is a purpose- reasons it is created. \nWhat the purpose of you being kind to everyone? \n\nIf you had a bad day, if you got up late, you nag, you complaining about your life, complaining about everyone around you, have you turned to yourself to change the environment that is not working for you?\nJust like a post, but is that your purpose to be negative?  It doesn't have to be that way, unless you give it the power to go that way, or change your mindset.\n\nOne question - is that your true purpose to be alive is to tell people you had a shitty day? approval of your post? Likes? What about dreams, hashtags , pretty photos of family friends and witty comments? \n\nIf all that is your true purpose to be alive, I rather sit in a cave for the next 10 years and see if everyone waken up to how can they help each other lives get to a better world than where we are living now? It's okay, your post, your well beings, your nature , your standards, religion, your emojis, your man made traditions , Bible, Allah, or whatever your belief system is, it is going to either shape this world for the better or worst.\n\nBut tell me. How long has this man made traditions been going on, straight marriage, straight pride? Union of 2. Why are ya not communicating to each other? Why are you talking behind each other to another? Why can't you both speak from the heart? What was the purpose behind that marriage? Love or happiness? \nOr was it just another way of saying, I am just using you for convenience?\n\nUnderstand, if the life or life of job no longer works, let it go, you had enjoy that experience, and now that experience no longer serves you, and as much as you hate to let go of an emotional attachment, Your holding on To false hope, hoping it get better, but it's not, let it go, trust something better is In The works, but it takes a firm decision to not look back , that is to truly letting go of your past experiences, to welcome a new experience, embrace it, cause it going to make you feel alive, and be able to look back, why didn't Iet go sooner?  \n\nIf you do not trust the choices you made In marriage or life, why did you put up with their shit, or why are you putting yourself in that position?\n\nYou ain't changing the world if you can't change yourself first.\n\nDo not be a burden, nor do not think what you do is a burden, but ask yourself what can you do to be burden free. \n\nIf you feel that you need to be there for those that needs you, I ask you. When are you going to need them , when you need them ? \n\nwhen you are always there for them, they are comfortable. They do not know the uncomfortable outside of that, that what you teach them, be dependent on you. \n\nwhen are they going to learn how to be there for you? How can they, when your never showed them\n\nDon't let family members life be your priority, they are human like you, who have a mind, feet, arms, and a mouth ,just like yourself, if they can't teach themselves, they will never understand themselves but understand through a book. \n\nIf they can't do it, show them, that what role models do, or if you don\u2019t know it yourself, learn. \n\nIf you have children, you have not done your job as a father, a mother, a brother, a sister, or a teacher, or a role model to teach them how to stand on their own two feet, but be a burden to yourself that you need to go out of your way, slaving over 80 hours, cook late dinner, make sure the house is clean , and everyone is fed, and most of all, no time to yourself. Teach them, help the load off your back, Lessing your burden when everyone works toward a common goals, survival. \n\nIf that what you all teach your kids, to Be dependent on others? is that how you want the world to be? By the time they reach 18, they still asking you, where dinner and still can't cook for themselves or asking if a friend family cooked cause your cooking sucks. \n\nYou want your kids To be independant some day, but what are you showing them, beside how to dependent on You? \n\nThat great you want your kids to be dependent on you, but when accident happens and your no longer there, \nWhat you think they going to blame? Not themselves, they blame those that didn't teach them any better. \nLike school shooting \n\nif you teach them something but you never showed them a proper way of doing it, are you going to be happy with yourself that your child didn't learn shit from you? Public schools are great. \n\nBut the best place to learn is from taking that step into the unknown that makes you uncomfortable. Why?\nWas life really suppose to be comfortable? Until thunder strikes, what you do then? You cant comprehend of how to deal with uncomfortably.\nUntil you make. Mistakes over and over, self reflect your action, your mind, your emotions, do not let others distractions from you understanding your own strength, weakness, and have the power to admit your mistakes, and walk on carry that experiences, and that life experiences, your journey will make who you are today\n\nIt will look like I judge, but I do not like judging, it\u2019s the actions behind the people makes me judge the character nature as a whole. I do not judge your skin, your background or your physique because , if you done something wrong, do not blame another race, skin, or physique but just that individuals. Why should a whole nation of races, skin color, and background be judge by one human from that upbringing environment? \n\nMonks go on searching for ways to enrich their state of mind , but what I see people don\u2019t see monks as a role model. Everyone would look at Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, or the joker as an idol, or even alter ego. That\u2019s something wrong with you accepting your own power, your own true self, you say it\u2019s for fun, but what are you super powers, partying and sex with drugs? Do you know what you want to do with your life on earth? Anything that does not involve hurting, lying, stealing, killing, the problems of the world that we all live in but do not trust each other. You have selective hearing? Selective trust. \n\nMonks go on this spiritual journey as the Buddha, the enlighten one the people called him. They know him through books, but never talked with the man, to know his true experiences, his true thoughts, his true wisdom, his journey but we settle for a book. \n\nI say this from my insight of skimming through reading bibles, religion, culture stuff, occult stuff, what divination tools are out there, it\u2019s purpose is there for you. But what was all the teachings for? You, right? Whoever heard, know, understand his teachings, what did you learn? \n\nI never joined a monastery, do not follow any religion path, nor do I read any books that help me understand what I need, desire to know the truth. \n\nHow do you know truth? You think reading this post is the truth or just parts of the truth, or just a big illusion? \n\nPeople who go on this spiritual journey, have you share your truth? Have you share your wisdom? I ask you , you tell me you have, but what , how are you displaying it, teaching it, or even let people know of this path? You can sit and meditate for the next 20 years in a cave, the world go on with or without you, and what you realized could have teach many others, but you need to find yourself first, in order to help others. \n\nThose that seeks out a spiritual teacher, I ask you, did you learn how to make your own decisions, be firm in your decision, be kind to others, help serving others be your purpose or everyone true purpose, do not wait on others to make life decisions for you, for you gave them power to a life you did not deserve or desire.\n\nThose that are lost without a teacher to go to, a mentor to tell you where to go, eat, sleep , or enjoying your life but instead go to a mentor, told him , you did what your mentor ask, now you await more commands- truth - you should be making a life choice for yourself, why are you bothering your teacher? \nYounthink your teacher didn\u2019t make decisions? He made the decision to help you, his life purpose to help others, but you busy asking to help yourself.\n\nYou made a reckless decision, you went to your mentor to forgive you, why? It was not your teacher action but yourself. Learn how to accept your own mistakes, learn from that mistakes, move on to forgive yourself, only you can make yourself guilty, resentment, and worse. \n\nThose went to search for a teacher, you found your teacher, you learn many things, many journeys, but now he passed on, you are lost without your teacher, now if I was your dead teacher, reincarnated, what did you think I was teaching you all to do? Be depending on a teacher to tell you how to makes life decisions for your own happiness. You still depending on a teacher that is passing on, grief over night and day like the death of a love one. What did this teacher feel knowing he thought all he teaches? He thought he taught them all his students not how to depends on others, including himself, but help others in need of help. You are not making that decision but wait to ask, you can\u2019t make that decision, and nobody going to make that decision unless you ask for a decision. \nWhen you keep asking the teacher how to make a life decision on what should I do for work, what should I do on my spare time, what I should do at this moment, you asking the teacher to make that life decision for you to do,chores, cook a meal, get a job, and all that he told you to do, is your life experiences, your journey to understand what you want to,do in life and it\u2019s not wiping tables. Now you done the task, you ask for more task, it\u2019s like a drug, the master gives you task, you do it, but what have you learn? Still you do as you or told, now the master finally passing on, he no longer make life decisions for you, now your feeling uncomfortable , you do not know the comfort of making your own decisions but someone else decisions. If you are still holding on to me, I have returned, but I am disappointed. You have not help others love, cared, or treat each other with respect, but slander each other names , most of all, disrespect my teaching. You are depending on me like a drug, now the drug is gone, now I ask you this big question have you learn how to get off the drug and be your own drug? \n\nIf the Buddha left his palace on a journey leaving everything behind to find enlightenment, did he hold on to any of his mentors? \n\nWhat you do see is the Buddha journey. You think he is the greatest, he is, but what type of experience, life journey lesson he had to,go through to get where he was? Look at your own life, your own experiences, your own journey, Buddha experiences loss, love, all that we all shared, an experience. He have his own way of doing things, until one day, he reached it. \nOne day he decided to help a human. This help made the human open his eyes to miracles. Now everyone wants to perform miracles. And in order to obtain this supernatural state of mind, he meditate. \n\nEveryone wants to reach the state of mind where Buddha is, so what did monks, and religion people do? Follow in his foot step. They decide to take the same road the prince took, do the same teachings of yoga and other things he learn along his journey, but what nobody thought is, what experiences work for Buddha? Buddha learn all these yoga techniques but it did not give him the answers to his long question. \nBut everyone doing it cause he did it.\nBuddha ate animals, killed animals and hunt animals before he became a vegan, so people are vegan.\nBuddha was a violent prince, arrogant and naive , but he have a heart, so people be kind.\nBuddha went on his own journey, and everyone assumed going on the same path as the Buddha going to,give you want you seek? You think you reach enlightenment doing the same things he does? \nIs this Batman experiences, Superman? That fiction story but it\u2019s their life experiences that made them who they are, but when you sit their waiting on decisions and mimic other lifestyles, your not living with your true self. \n\nNow, you follow your heart, you follow and stand by your decision, you learn along the way, before you was an angry person, now you learn how to be kind, it\u2019s your experiences, your journey going to help you find enlightenment, and it\u2019s not following a pilgrimage, a man tradition, only you will know what enlightenment feels like, the Buddha can\u2019t tell you, cause he is not you, or your experiences. \n\nThey do not see this truth, those that meditate for centuries long, that was the Buddha experiences to obtaining enlightenment, he didn\u2019t tell you to do the same things he did to get where he is. He didn\u2019t teach you all to be depending on others but your own feet\u2019s, hands and body. He didn\u2019t tell you to do yoga, or starve yourself fasting for days, but everyone follows cause they don\u2019t have the power to make decisions for themselves. Tell me, how many monks still meditate but have not share his enlightenment wisdom to heal this world? \n\nBuddha once said I do not want to teach the world my truth, for everyone will be ignorant, arrogant, and shun my teachings as crazy. I feel the same way, but one day, a god told him to share his wisdom. He shared it with his disciples, each disciples have their own ways teachings knowledge, now his wisdom is all over the world, now I ask you, what are you going to share? \n\nYou want enlightenment, it not where you think, or know, or believe it is, it starts with you. \n\nNow I ask you, how firm is your decision to make changes around your life In the next 120 hours?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43408, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "You think with your mind, choices with your mind, where is the heart?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561813981, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c6k1j8/you_think_with_your_mind_choices_with_your_mind/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "tunesaga", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1964y436", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561726874, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c6jx3p/you_think_but_you_do_not_know_your_heart/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c6jx3p", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c6jx3p/you_think_but_you_do_not_know_your_heart/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561726875, "score": 0, "selftext": "The day when you just don't want to respond to any posts, or jump on Facebook, is the day social media isn't doing it for ya.

What about dreams, hashtags , pretty photos of family friends and witty comments? \n\nIf all that is your true purpose to be alive, I rather sit in a cave for the next 10 years and see if everyone waken up to how can they help each other lives get to a better world than where we are living now? It's okay, your post, your well beings, your nature , your standards, religion, your emojis, your man made traditions , Bible, Allah, or whatever your belief system is, it is going to either shape this world for the better or worst.\n\nBut tell me. How long has this man made traditions been going on, straight marriage, straight pride? Union of 2. Why are ya not communicating to each other? Why are you talking behind each other to another? Why can't you both speak from the heart? What was the purpose behind that marriage? Love or happiness? \nOr was it just another way of saying, I am just using you for convenience?\n\nUnderstand, if the life or life of job no longer works, let it go, you had enjoy that experience, and now that experience no longer serves you, and as much as you hate to let go of an emotional attachment, Your holding on To false hope, hoping it get better, but it's not, let it go, trust something better is In The works, but it takes a firm decision to not look back , that is to truly letting go of your past experiences, to welcome a new experience, embrace it, cause it going to make you feel alive, and be able to look back, why didn't Iet go sooner?  \n\nIf you do not trust the choices you made In marriage or life, why did you put up with their shit, or why are you putting yourself in that position?\n\nYou ain't changing the world if you can't change yourself first.\n\nDo not be a burden, nor do not think what you do is a burden, but ask yourself what can you do to be burden free. \n\nIf you feel that you need to be there for those that needs you, I ask you. When are you going to need them , when you need them ? \n\nwhen you are always there for them, they are comfortable. They do not know the uncomfortable outside of that, that what you teach them, be dependent on you. \n\nwhen are they going to learn how to be there for you? How can they, when your never showed them\n\nDon't let family members life be your priority, they are human like you, who have a mind, feet, arms, and a mouth ,just like yourself, if they can't teach themselves, they will never understand themselves but understand through a book. \n\nIf they can't do it, show them, that what role models do, or if you don\u2019t know it yourself, learn. \n\nIf you have children, you have not done your job as a father, a mother, a brother, a sister, or a teacher, or a role model to teach them how to stand on their own two feet, but be a burden to yourself that you need to go out of your way, slaving over 80 hours, cook late dinner, make sure the house is clean , and everyone is fed, and most of all, no time to yourself. Teach them, help the load off your back, Lessing your burden when everyone works toward a common goals, survival. \n\nIf that what you all teach your kids, to Be dependent on others? is that how you want the world to be? By the time they reach 18, they still asking you, where dinner and still can't cook for themselves or asking if a friend family cooked cause your cooking sucks. \n\nYou want your kids To be independant some day, but what are you showing them, beside how to dependent on You? \n\nThat great you want your kids to be dependent on you, but when accident happens and your no longer there, \nWhat you think they going to blame? Not themselves, they blame those that didn't teach them any better. \nLike school shooting \n\nif you teach them something but you never showed them a proper way of doing it, are you going to be happy with yourself that your child didn't learn shit from you? Public schools are great. \n\nBut the best place to learn is from taking that step into the unknown that makes you uncomfortable. Why?\nWas life really suppose to be comfortable? Until thunder strikes, what you do then? You cant comprehend of how to deal with uncomfortably.\nUntil you make. Mistakes over and over, self reflect your action, your mind, your emotions, do not let others distractions from you understanding your own strength, weakness, and have the power to admit your mistakes, and walk on carry that experiences, and that life experiences, your journey will make who you are today\n\nIt will look like I judge, but I do not like judging, it\u2019s the actions behind the people makes me judge the character nature as a whole. I do not judge your skin, your background or your physique because , if you done something wrong, do not blame another race, skin, or physique but just that individuals. Why should a whole nation of races, skin color, and background be judge by one human from that upbringing environment? \n\nMonks go on searching for ways to enrich their state of mind , but what I see people don\u2019t see monks as a role model. Everyone would look at Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, or the joker as an idol, or even alter ego. That\u2019s something wrong with you accepting your own power, your own true self, you say it\u2019s for fun, but what are you super powers, partying and sex with drugs? Do you know what you want to do with your life on earth? Anything that does not involve hurting, lying, stealing, killing, the problems of the world that we all live in but do not trust each other. You have selective hearing? Selective trust. \n\nMonks go on this spiritual journey as the Buddha, the enlighten one the people called him. They know him through books, but never talked with the man, to know his true experiences, his true thoughts, his true wisdom, his journey but we settle for a book. \n\nI say this from my insight of skimming through reading bibles, religion, culture stuff, occult stuff, what divination tools are out there, it\u2019s purpose is there for you. But what was all the teachings for? You, right? Whoever heard, know, understand his teachings, what did you learn? \n\nI never joined a monastery, do not follow any religion path, nor do I read any books that help me understand what I need, desire to know the truth. \n\nHow do you know truth? You think reading this post is the truth or just parts of the truth, or just a big illusion? \n\nPeople who go on this spiritual journey, have you share your truth? Have you share your wisdom? I ask you , you tell me you have, but what , how are you displaying it, teaching it, or even let people know of this path? You can sit and meditate for the next 20 years in a cave, the world go on with or without you, and what you realized could have teach many others, but you need to find yourself first, in order to help others. \n\nThose that seeks out a spiritual teacher, I ask you, did you learn how to make your own decisions, be firm in your decision, be kind to others, help serving others be your purpose or everyone true purpose, do not wait on others to make life decisions for you, for you gave them power to a life you did not deserve or desire.\n\nThose that are lost without a teacher to go to, a mentor to tell you where to go, eat, sleep , or enjoying your life but instead go to a mentor, told him , you did what your mentor ask, now you await more commands- truth - you should be making a life choice for yourself, why are you bothering your teacher? \nYounthink your teacher didn\u2019t make decisions? He made the decision to help you, his life purpose to help others, but you busy asking to help yourself.\n\nYou made a reckless decision, you went to your mentor to forgive you, why? It was not your teacher action but yourself. Learn how to accept your own mistakes, learn from that mistakes, move on to forgive yourself, only you can make yourself guilty, resentment, and worse. \n\nThose went to search for a teacher, you found your teacher, you learn many things, many journeys, but now he passed on, you are lost without your teacher, now if I was your dead teacher, reincarnated, what did you think I was teaching you all to do? Be depending on a teacher to tell you how to makes life decisions for your own happiness. You still depending on a teacher that is passing on, grief over night and day like the death of a love one. What did this teacher feel knowing he thought all he teaches? He thought he taught them all his students not how to depends on others, including himself, but help others in need of help. You are not making that decision but wait to ask, you can\u2019t make that decision, and nobody going to make that decision unless you ask for a decision. \nWhen you keep asking the teacher how to make a life decision on what should I do for work, what should I do on my spare time, what I should do at this moment, you asking the teacher to make that life decision for you to do,chores, cook a meal, get a job, and all that he told you to do, is your life experiences, your journey to understand what you want to,do in life and it\u2019s not wiping tables. Now you done the task, you ask for more task, it\u2019s like a drug, the master gives you task, you do it, but what have you learn? Still you do as you or told, now the master finally passing on, he no longer make life decisions for you, now your feeling uncomfortable , you do not know the comfort of making your own decisions but someone else decisions. If you are still holding on to me, I have returned, but I am disappointed. You have not help others love, cared, or treat each other with respect, but slander each other names , most of all, disrespect my teaching. You are depending on me like a drug, now the drug is gone, now I ask you this big question have you learn how to get off the drug and be your own drug? \n\nIf the Buddha left his palace on a journey leaving everything behind to find enlightenment, did he hold on to any of his mentors? \n\nWhat you do see is the Buddha journey. You think he is the greatest, he is, but what type of experience, life journey lesson he had to,go through to get where he was? Look at your own life, your own experiences, your own journey, Buddha experiences loss, love, all that we all shared, an experience. He have his own way of doing things, until one day, he reached it. \nOne day he decided to help a human. This help made the human open his eyes to miracles. Now everyone wants to perform miracles. And in order to obtain this supernatural state of mind, he meditate. \n\nEveryone wants to reach the state of mind where Buddha is, so what did monks, and religion people do? Follow in his foot step. They decide to take the same road the prince took, do the same teachings of yoga and other things he learn along his journey, but what nobody thought is, what experiences work for Buddha? Buddha learn all these yoga techniques but it did not give him the answers to his long question. \nBut everyone doing it cause he did it.\nBuddha ate animals, killed animals and hunt animals before he became a vegan, so people are vegan.\nBuddha was a violent prince, arrogant and naive , but he have a heart, so people be kind.\nBuddha went on his own journey, and everyone assumed going on the same path as the Buddha going to,give you want you seek? You think you reach enlightenment doing the same things he does? \nIs this Batman experiences, Superman? That fiction story but it\u2019s their life experiences that made them who they are, but when you sit their waiting on decisions and mimic other lifestyles, your not living with your true self. \n\nNow, you follow your heart, you follow and stand by your decision, you learn along the way, before you was an angry person, now you learn how to be kind, it\u2019s your experiences, your journey going to help you find enlightenment, and it\u2019s not following a pilgrimage, a man tradition, only you will know what enlightenment feels like, the Buddha can\u2019t tell you, cause he is not you, or your experiences. \n\nThey do not see this truth, those that meditate for centuries long, that was the Buddha experiences to obtaining enlightenment, he didn\u2019t tell you to do the same things he did to get where he is. He didn\u2019t teach you all to be depending on others but your own feet\u2019s, hands and body. He didn\u2019t tell you to do yoga, or starve yourself fasting for days, but everyone follows cause they don\u2019t have the power to make decisions for themselves. Tell me, how many monks still meditate but have not share his enlightenment wisdom to heal this world? \n\nBuddha once said I do not want to teach the world my truth, for everyone will be ignorant, arrogant, and shun my teachings as crazy. I feel the same way, but one day, a god told him to share his wisdom. He shared it with his disciples, each disciples have their own ways teachings knowledge, now his wisdom is all over the world, now I ask you, what are you going to share? \n\nYou want enlightenment, it not where you think, or know, or believe it is, it starts with you. \n\nNow I ask you, how firm is your decision to make changes around your life In the next 120 hours?", "send_replies": true,

Having Faith in God, the Universe, Source, Energy, Love, Spirit, Allah, Buddha, Jesus...whatever your personal beliefs are, gives you access to another dimension of spirituality where you have trust that you have something to accomplish during your lifetime.\n\n2) GRATITUDE &amp; PRAYER\ud83d\ude4f\n\nWe have to show Gratitude everyday for what we have been given. Everything that surrounds us is perfect and magnificent just the way it is. The present moment is perfect and everything that has ever happened to you was meant to bring you here to this day.\n\nPray everyday to give gratitude and thank Source for all that you are and all that you have.

It was almost like looking into each other's souls. I don't understand what this means and I've been googling the shit out of this with no hope. I'm hoping someone here can give me some advice on this?

So if you want a better way of life/society the people need to practice and improve in these areas and not be lazy or full with pride by rejecting this. \n\nLiterally everything on earth for a 100% fact was created by thought and intentions. Then the word was sent, to trigger a reply, then an action was committed to make this thought a reality. This is the gift of manifestation. We all have a hand in creating our lives. You just need to set your sights on what you like and pursue it. \n\nGod is the original architect of creation. And he allows us to participate in his domain. Allowing us and giving us our own dreams and visions that we would like to create. But now this power has been split up over time and handed up to the ill intended and low vibrational people in order to create their own pleasures and not ours. \n\nIf thought creates reality. Why in God\u2019s green earth have we given our powers to manifest reality, and hand majority of that power to people who literally only want to ensue violence and poor favour. Literally all around the world we are allowing people with very poor and corrupted minds to be the front runners of our race. And we can see where this gets us.. \n\nFor example in a world without \u201csin\u201d there world be peace and prosperity. Let\u2019s not talk about all the effects of a world like this because there\u2019s far too much to say. But my point is. We would have manifested completely differently. We would be a very advanced and quickly progressing species, very accepting and loyal to each other. We would honestly probably be exploring all over the universe right now and making awesome things. Finding new planets, looking and creating beauty, who knows, maybe finding new life intelligent or not. In all, it would be dope, earth would be our HQ and like command centres and we would probably colonize other or certain planets, and make impossibilities possible. As we have done before. \n\nSo I\u2019m not going to preach on oh we have to do \u201cthis this and that\u201d, it\u2019s simple. We need to manifest better. We need to make better things and come to better conclusions and make better solutions. There\u2019s literally an answer to everything you can ask. The answer just must be revealed.. through time effort and thought/brainpower. \n\nIt would be the best for leaders of like all nations to actually just drop their pride and step aside so people who are more suited can step in and clean up this mess.. it\u2019s as simple as that. Humans are smart.. a lot of us anyways. And those who are decent know the appropriate direction we need to take in order to move in a better direction. And yes. There is a best path out there. But our current leaders are too blinded by literally their own pride and ego to look and search for it. People think oh think ahead for the future. Our governments are focused on preparing for what they are gonna do now, and within a few following years. This is completely understandable as if they did not how could we operate in the present. But we need think further, or we will be blasted outta orbit. It\u2019s that simple. \n\nNow. What needs to be made is this. We follow the best path, and we do what\u2019s good, right, fair, and just. We will hold ourselves up to our own standards and the standards of God. And we shall not break them. As breaking them will provoke and create or manifest things that are against us. Hatred, violence, corrupted actions and thoughts. These things are destructive and when building something positive and fruitful we don\u2019t need that. \n\nTrolls are fine, trolling is fun but play with people who are thick skinned. Don\u2019t target the weak as they will be damaged and will take long to repair and heal. Maybe never heal too. Not all wounds makes you stronger. It depends on how you respond to pain or trauma. You must have a sense of responsibility when acting and speaking. And try to know how to correct a mistake or bad action. As making mistakes happen in life. We arnt perfect. But it\u2019s how we react and follow through with these mistakes is what really matters. \n\nNow let\u2019s be real. The whole world as it is now is against us. All of us. You. Me. Them. They. Everyone. Even those leading. Those in charge, are actually acting against themselves and they don\u2019t realize it. And it\u2019s because they lack vision and quality\u2019s. They let finite and minuscule things get in the way of better judgement and better ways of thinking and accepting new thought. \n\nAs of right now we are at the bay of the enemy. Who are at the bay of themselves. As we approach the threshold of danger, high danger. We could probably become more and more irritated and rebellious. And we will realize that there is less time to act. But even at this point there will still be barriers in place to contain our wills. There will be people in our way to physically stop us from changing direction/course. And let\u2019s be honest. Even if we find a way to break through their layer of defence. Where then do you go, what do you do, how do u get the bad people to comply. And will we even have the time to salvage what\u2019s left? \n\nIt\u2019s an honest hard task. Taking over by force is absolutely not an option in any case form or issue. Because this is a global threat and disaster. Simply revolting in one country will make very little to no progress. As one country cannot make the impact we need in order to change course. Because then the problems will still be alive in other nations. Which could them view you as a threat to their foolish wishes and power. And you know what could happen after that. \n\nSo really we need to explain our situation. And deviate from it. Collectively as a group. On a common goal. That being - Do what it means to be human, as a reflection of Gods image (a higher standard) and fulfill it. Knowing it holds more and is better for you. For all of us. Leaving nobody. Not even the \u201cbad people\u201d\n\nOur goals need to increase and progress gradually as we complete basic tasks, standards, and necessity\u2019s. That will ensure all of our safety\u2019s. And needs/security. Then we will grow into more complex goals and tasks later as a group one we are more stable and recovered. \n\nFirst what we need to do is - Not only hear, but really and truly listen to other people and understand them. People can scream in your ear and you will never hear or identify the real issue. The route of their pain. That is the key. That is what you must search for and understand and relate to. Then you come to a common ground and conclusion, and move forward together. You can either hold grudges forever. Which is childish and immature. Or you can move past them. Which is a big sign of growth. Now yes you can take your time doing this. \n\nWe need care for love. And look out for eachother. As we are all the same. We all cry to the same pain, and our hearts all align with them same needs and desires. As we all come from the same God. There is a deeper reason as to why we have been separated and have our differences. But it\u2019s not because we ourselves are truly different. We are just unique and share separate quality\u2019s. But we\u2019re all on the same journey. And within us is the same goal and same vision. This is what holds us together as a race. We are just too foolish to realize this. Ofc there are cases of deviants but they probably will serve another purpose one day or now. But if you believe in democracy, then you should listen to all of us. And what we all want is for nobody to suffer and cry. No one to be hurt or impoverished, manipulated or oppressed. Impoverished or malnourished. Nobody should life in ignorance or darkness, and be used lied to and acted wrongly against. These things are FUCKED up. And I will NEVER stand for them. Whether you stand with me or not. \n\nWe are killing each other, torturing the innocent and defenceless. Hell torturing anyone is unacceptable. We have absolutely no morals or standards for anything and anyone. And then we trick ourselves into thinking we do because in our countries there\u2019s food on our plates and roofs over our heads. And that speak for most of us. Oh fuck the rest though. If I can\u2019t see it it\u2019s not my concern. That\u2019s how you treat your lost brothers and sisters. You were conditioned from birth. To operate in a society. And submit to a world which purpose was to destroy you. You were not taught to gain heart and care/love. You weren\u2019t taught to use your immense power and will/passion. You weren\u2019t taught that if you strive for the impossible. It will all bend to your will in the end. \n\nWe were literally born into a world with powers and dominions. Army\u2019s and leaders(corrupt ones). And we\u2019re conditioned to stand on the sidelines and not interfere with their motives. Hell you can try. You can run for leadership but shit. We\u2019re you ever supplied with what is necessary to honestly make a dent in their little game? Fuck no. Born into a society odds are you are in essence very influenced and controlled.. who do you think teaches you and enforced law and creates our cericulms in school? The same government that is corrupted, and uses you. That you are against now after learning these things. You think they will give you the means to dismantle and break their empire they so love? Fuck no dude. They would rather just have you work for them and do their best to strip you of everything you need to find out more and or overcome them. \n\nThat being said. There is a bigger issue at hand here. We can pretty much imagine that the world governments are working hand in hand and creating drama and distractions. And small victories in order to keep us confused and unfocused. As if we all identified the problem. Which we now have. Almost. We could then be able to make them powerless to us essentially. Because they need us. Not we need them. They just want to but as much time as they can in order to make their empire stand until it crushes us. And they don\u2019t give a damn right now either. \n\nSo what do we do? Nothing. Spread this information. And I\u2019ll make more soon. Word is the key. That\u2019s the only way. Unless u want to trigger a major war. No country wants to be blindly overtaken by anyone, they won\u2019t care about what the cause it. It\u2019s an invasion. \n\nWe need to use reason and convince the destructors to essentially diffuse themselves and allow our visions and manifestations override their. As we need it. \n\nNow what does that mean for the future. A lot. But that\u2019s not a big deal. All you need to focus on now is how to get this/these messages across. And the rest will be handled. Always. \n\nSo what are we creating? Hope today, a real future tomorrow. Then incredibilities the next day. And that\u2019s all we need to know. For now. \n\n- Revolutionzz", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43300, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Part of the solution", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561710405, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c62yu2/part_of_the_solution/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "crazyconspirator94", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_25z8adec", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561616013, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c61wxr/i_really_need_help_please/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c61wxr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c61wxr/i_really_need_help_please/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561616014, "score": 3, "selftext": "Didn't know where to post this but I've just come to the realization (meaning actually realized with all my being) that I've been an energy vampire towards the people in my life I love the most.

I am posting spiritual insights in this article I wrote to enter to go to The Spirit Vine Ayahuasca retreat in Brazil. Feel free to share. :) \n\nFrom the time we're born, there really is no time. Our ego is created in childhood, we create a separation between you and me. With ego comes a mentality of scarcity, competition and therefore worry. I heard on a Sunday sermon that worry in the mind is like shoveling smoke, unproductive, and with that, the scripture from the Bible was cited, and paraphrasing it, we are not able to add one hour to our life whether we worry or not. \n\nWe are empty space really, transparent, for that is when the light can shine through our being. With our minds we create concepts, judgements and resistance to what is, that is when we add opaque layers to the see through glass vessel we are. The light is there, as if waiting to pass through, it waits with open arms, it's as relaxing and easy as floating in a pool of warm water looking up at the bright blue sky. \n\nLet go of the pain that binds you, relinquish your story, for that's gone. Now is eternity, the now, that you are infinite and loved beyond measure. \n\nWhen your mind tells you that you are on the wrong path, relax, and inquire your guides, the universe will respond, it will show you how to walk in the light of your truth.  Child, I could kiss your forehead now and give you a warm embrace, for that is who we are, that is home. \n\nAs Eckhart Tolle describes, ego drives conflict. Pain bodies feed off of drama, which is conflict based in stories, mere mental concepts. There is a space within yourself where light can shine though, the light of consciousness, that is awareness.\n\n You can be aware in every moment, fully present, following the path of light, and there feeling connectedness to the higher intelligence, which we are all an expression of.  This intelligence and beauty can be seen when your eyes are open and you allow the present moment to be.  As you grow and glow day by day, the possibilities are infinite as we are. Miracles occur in succession, it's the synchronicity coming in. \n\nEach journey is individual, and yet we are all woven together, as if the universe is a giant tapestry.  Your journey is so personal, yet impacting on everyone around you. To thine own self be true, by authenticity in walking in the light, you may impact and inspire in ways unbeknown to you. Through people, things and places we can see sanctity. Perhaps it's a book that may shift the way you see life, a moment in time when you're alone in your room and have a profound realization, a song that speaks to your soul. There are so many ways to learn and so many ways to teach. \n\nAs Wayne Dyer explained, Divine love doesn't change, we can choose that love. We can see ourselves in everything, we are one. We are love. \n\nWe have the magnificent opportunity to choose love right here right now, again and again. What beauty would flow from that? When we follow our calling of love, we are a sanctuary for other beings to be reminded that love is home. We can reflect that, by choice. I find relinquishing my story and mental concepts allows for grace to enter, my beautiful friend Aaleyah's definition of grace is meeting someone where they're at. I will meet myself where I'm at, I will meet all of you where you're at, with compassion and Divine love.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43264, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Divine Love", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561689267, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c5zv6y/divine_love/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "BrighterLater", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_qg24a", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561598608, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c5z4ge/sometimes_i_miss_my_prespirituality_relationships/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c5z4ge", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 44, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c5z4ge/sometimes_i_miss_my_prespirituality_relationships/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561598609, "score": 86, "selftext": "Been feeling this one a bit lately.

Friends who mean a lot to me, drinkin' buddies, the In crowd, and party animals, great jokesters and easy-goers. \n\nI suppose it feels like I'm still in-between worlds... not quite supported by the old tribe and not yet connecting fully with a new tribe.

It's easy to follow your dreams when you're succeeding and in abundance but, in the developmental stage, it can feel a little lonely. \n\nThink I'll have a little prayer today; help me find the vibration to connect with kindred spirits and abundance within my purpose.

Every soul has left the Earth bodies. There is a standard set by inner wellbeing. \n\nIf the body reaches a certain level of fear it piterally jumps out of it's skin metaphysically. This is the jacked up fight or flight which drains your adrenaline to escape prey.\n\nUnfortunately there is a limited amount of these we get per body. These moments are what people in karmic religions call sudden enlightenmebt because you are now in a sort of greater awareness of life and death. Meaning your energy has dialated leaving you as less of a being. In case it happens again you are put in to permanent fear.\n\nThere is a recovery period the first time this happens and if you make it to safety with adequate survival factors, sleep, shelter, medicaid, clan support, food and distance from enemies you can recover yourself. But you do not benefit. You lose lifespan to heal.\n\nSo the first time we feel this now is in the uterus. The first toxic overdose to be exact. By the poluted diet or habits of mother or simply the environent. Plus we are allready devolved to be weaker than ever before.\n\nSo this happens without recovery every day in the womb. Constant machine noise  smoke, toxins, malnourishment and lack of sleep. Make the baby insane which is why it screams in terror and cannot walk when born.\n\nThe birth process is the most traumatic event in the biolife of this entity. After that it is a mere shell. A survival robot in permaflight. Never recovers from this event. No matter what you do. People take ayahuasca or diets or any other crazy shit. Nope your soul has darted.\n\nYour oroginal essence. The intelligence which endevoured to sense it's way in life has been mashed and broken. Nerves frayed and mangled. Hologram system lacking adequate dna to even build a soul bearing vessel. You are a shell.\n\nThen they stab you with vaccines and this is like beating a dead horse. The dead nerves convulse in a relay and the senses shut down further. Leaving a few functions like breathing and eating. Then they brutally force you to learn by trial to walk and speak the evil languages of torture made of dark spells. English etc. So they can create an identification computer.\n\nYou are named and shipped out as military hardware put in storage for use in the war machine. Or simply forgot about. Your endevours to sense the world diminish until you decide to erase the cancer that tries to regrow your soul still. The empty hole where many life generators should be. Your body tries to imagine the pressence of these things and puts pieces in place. Alas you are a caved in structure. A mere gollum filled with cobwebs.\n\nEvery generation another divine function of our comolex alien soul becomes eroded. Our heart and third eye and throat and solar plexus. Eaten to the core. Energetically sapped and rerouted to produce food for the vampires. The life lingering effort to create the pieces inside you is taken advantage of. They use their keys to unlock your secret chakras and feed off of them. They can display your inner sanctum and bite it off.\n\nChildren are no longer born to live and evolve. They are mere support for the dying old. Fodder. Cattle. They eat our energy from these malfunctioning machines that produce suffering out of failure. We can never rebuild. We are automota.

I cannot even enjoy simple pleasures like reading a spiritual/emotional book as it bores me--I would much rather do no thinking and try to be \"at peace\"--to let my mind just be, but I so very much wish that I could expand my mind and open it to radical ways of thinking that will shake my core and make me cry for once.

A few days ago I had a profound spiritual experience.  It was amazing, powerful, explosive, and clear.  I can only describe it as what unconditional love must feel like. But I\u2019m having a hard time digesting it and I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to about it so I\u2019m hoping my Reddit family can help me out. \n\nBasically, I was driving my car listening to one of my favorite songs.  I was in a really good place and feeling aligned with my highest self.  I had a thought of inspiration which led to this explosion of energy. It filled my chest, arms, neck, face, and all the way up to my crown. It felt like every cell was stimulated. It felt so good I began to weep. This experience was amazing in and of itself, but what I\u2019m having a hard time understanding is that I believe I received a message from my higher self. It\u2019s hard to describe out of context, but it told me, \u201cjust keep going, just keep going, just keep going.\u201d  This message was crystal clear and I knew exactly what it meant.  For a few minutes, everything was clear and I hadn\u2019t a care in the world. It was absolute bliss. \n\nBut what I\u2019m wondering is has anyone else had any similar experiences where they received a message from their highest self?  Could it possibly be the divine speaking directly to me?  Is it my subconscious playing a trick on me?  It felt real but was it an illusion?  I\u2019m grateful for the experience but I\u2019m somewhat confused because the message conflicts with the physical reality. (Short and sweet, I\u2019m trying to get back together with a girl and she\u2019s telling me no. But my higher self told me to just keep going.)\n\nThanks for any insight. I don\u2019t have many friends on my level of consciousness so it\u2019s challenging interpreting this situation alone.

It first started when she would look at her time, it matched up exactly with her battery percentage. Every time she would look at her time it was a different number but matched up perfectly with her battery percentage. We dismissed it, then me and my girlfriend would be talking about something and it would later come up on tv or when we scroll on social media. It turned from funny coincidences to what we later looked up to be \u201csynchronicity.\u201d Apparently it means I\u2019m on the right track of whatever life was going to show me.

There are tons of lies that can be turned around and used as life hacks, but the fact of the matter is that we are controlled by the 1 percent and they know exactly what they are doing. Most people get so annoyed when they hear about how people turned their life around with for example nofap or semen retention and even when 10.000+ have amazing experiences they dont wanna hear it because that is how most humans ego works, we think we are right and we cant imagine their being a much intelligent force out there who knows how to brainwash. Anyway lets look at the biggest lies that the elite has used to deplete us of spiritual power, chemical imbalance, hormonal imbalance, and just make us weak low conscious beings:\n\n**The ejaculation lie:** Not really gonna go into this one, but this is probably the most important play by the elites, as sexual energy and sperm is litterally god inside us and the most powerful driving creating thing on the planet. If they cant control our sexual energy, their other plans will most likely also fail so this one is the most important by far. Check out r/semenretention or r/nofap to see how immense benefits people get.\n\n**The \"eat 3 times a day lie\":** This one is also huge. When our body is eating its litterally ALWAYS working. The ancient egyptians firmly believed that the only way to heal ourself of something is to not eat or drink. This has all became mainstream again(thankfully) with Water fasting and Dry fasting(which is the most effective healing method in my opinion for anything!!) Even intermittent fasting has provided tons of benefits for people and thats \"only\" 16 hours of fasting per day. The lies about us having to eat breakfest and other 3 meals a day is made so our body can never heal itself, us spending more money on doctors and by far profiting the elite even more.\n\n**The warm water lie:** This is not really a lie but mainly something almost everyone does and have always done. Taking warm showers. Not only is it bad for skin and sperm count, but its bad for testosterone(the driving force of men) There have been found estrogen chemicals in water and as we know warm water litterally open your pores for you to absorb them. This is also why people have been reporting benefits of cold showers as to feeling way more manly, horny, and confident.\n\nThere are tons of other lies for example the flouride lie. I would love to hear some more lies by the elites that can be turned around for tons of benefits!

We all eventually wake up(when we mature as adults and reach a certain level of sophistication or after we die) but some of us are awakened way before the alarm is supposed to ring.\n\nWhat trauma does is makes people supra aware(unless they go batshit crazy which is also possible, a complete flight of the soul from the body IMO) and this can be a good thing and a bad thing.\n\nIt's good because now you are no longer asleep to what is happening, you have gained the ability of meta cognition(thoughts about thoughts.)\n\nIt's bad because although you are hyper aware, due to the rude awakening, your heart has not matured to the degree that it can balance the supra awareness with a supra intuitiveness or heart awareness(love/non-duality).\n\nSo those who experience trauma then end up having supra awareness of only their own Ego. And you see how this can become a problem. Some of the worst villains throughout history have had traumas(lots childhood trauma.)\n\nBut lots of great men have also endured traumas. What I've learned is that the supra awareness that trauma produces is a double edged sword. It can either supra accentuate your own ego(doubling down on the denial/delusion of separation) or it can provide the perfect opportunity for you to become supra aware of Life itself.\n\nAnd this is not a very complex endeavor. All we have to do is become supra aware of our awareness. In other words, meditation or plugging back in to the power source.\n\nWho am I to tell you what you should or should not be doing. All I am saying is that if you are not at peace(not the same as being comfortably numb) you may not have fully burned away all of the trauma that you're holding onto.\n\nThe fire of suffering becomes the [Light](https://external-preview.redd.it/TBiHdpn3eqnLslq461WX8qBp67m_IV8WuofJgrSkIBk.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=6a0610e3b3259b2945b095599e0c4abb2692866a) of [Consciousness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zdNdjF-htY).\n\nFeel free to leave your thoughts.\n\n^((Shout out to: T.R.T.T.A.B. who inspired the post.))\n\nEdit: Trauma depending on the circumstance will create a supra awareness of one's ego that is now also identified/attached/enmeshed with the *character* that has been unjustly treated. And this will naturally be followed by strong emotions of hatred, resentment, and indignation. These emotions will lead to a certain vibration of thoughts which will then fix that person at a certain spiritual frequency. If one is sufficiently charged up in this manner, well I'll rephrase, chances are(if you were wondering) you are not one of these individuals.\n\nIf you are reading this and have gained or are recognizing the insight there is a part of you that needs to forgive or let go of something from the past, that is an indication that your intuitive awareness is functioning at least a certain level. If one is critically imbalanced with a supra awareness of the Mind(Ego), then he will be so identified/attached/enmeshed with one's projected victimized character that he will not have the ability to stressfully procrastinate forgiving or letting go of something that no longer or has ever served you.\n\nI don't know if I'm making this sound like a good thing or a bad thing but it's a good thing. :)\n\nBecause now you are lucid enough to recognize that your current experience of not being able to transcend your past is the way it is exactly as it should be, based on the way it happened. It's become evident that we have a nature and among them, Self-Respect stands out as one of, if not what is paramount among its principle values. And any accost perpetuated and suffered will both suffer as any act of injustice is an injustice to the One Mind/Heart; this would manifest as guilt for the perpetrator of the act and shame for victim. The point remains however(and I realize I keep going on tangents) that we realize that we have the awareness albeit not yet a supra awareness, to be aware of what is happening rather than what is happening to us, or  \"to Me.\"\n\nIn ending, there are two streams that are competing for balance. The Supra awareness of the Ego or the Mind and the Supra awareness of the Heart/Intuition of non-duality. As humans, we must balance the two in such a way that we become supra aware of awareness itself.

If there is anyone who has the Spirit of grace here can they please do some sort of response to this? I have an absolutely crazy series of events that even trying to wrap my head around them fills my eyes with tears.\nI've typed it out on notes for you and pasting it sorry about the length!! \nBeen having some issues at work and was chatting to this one manager (we'll call him Joe) about it and he seemed he was helping me through but for some reason I seemed to feel more lost? Anyway I noticed he was... Charming the new store manager, it reminded me of how the devil was once an angel of light and I prayed, in my head with them in sight \"oh God no, please, not her she is too pure\". About a week or two later, I'm at work, doing my job. Hear in my head \"I am the Archangel Michael, I have come to assist you in your time of need\" and I replied \"how do I know it's really you?\" He said \"I carry the blue horn\". \n\nWas having quite a stressful day about a week or two after that, and ended up shouting at a different manager (wrong, I know) and I went to see Joe, who called the other manager up to the office. We had a chat, all was good, I got up to leave and just as I touched the door, I felt myself thrust forward by the neck, my eyes closed and when I reopened them they felt bigger, brighter and it was like I could see... more? I looked at Joe and said \"thank you\" and his face was like that of a trickster. His eyes were wide, but not as wide as his grin. I looked at manager #2 and said his name, he looked at me and I genuinely saw the fear of God in him. I imagine Joe looked at him (he didn't say anything) because manager #2 tore his gaze from me and toward Joe, bowed his head and blushed. I went to close the door and left it ajar (Joe said \"leave it open\" as I walked away) and whatever influence was over me felt lifted almost, but only in action? I dashed back and pushed the door open fully. I felt a deep shame or disappointment that didn't quite feel like it belonged to me? I went to the bathroom, looked in the mirror and you're never gonna believe it but my eyes were gold!? I immediately walked away cause I was like... Whooaaaaa. They went back to normal as soon as I went downstairs (I checked)\n\nFew weeks later I felt something pulling me to Church, and I was on my own in there just reflecting and thinking and doing the things I believe would be asked of someone trying to find God. I wandered around a bit, and saw a set of bibles, 3 were upright and the last was laying down.

Thankfully, I managed to stay afloat throughout my crazy year. I was privileged enough to witness and experience some very \u201cbad\u201d human behavior. It may seem odd to hear someone say they were privileged to encounter bad behavior; but I\u2019m odd, so it really can\u2019t seem too odd coming from me!\n\n \n\nThere is a lot we can learn from observing the bad behavior of others; and there\u2019s even more we can learn when people treat us badly.  Learning is the most important part of being human; and that\u2019s why it\u2019s a privilege to witness and experience bad behavior: we learn a lot.\n\n \n\nAlthough I witnessed a great deal of bad behavior over this last year, I didn\u2019t suffer too badly. Hardly at all, considering. I didn\u2019t suffer too badly because I\u2019ve become more detached as I\u2019ve moved along this thing called life; but also because I\u2019m mastering something. I\u2019m not mastering this something because I'm a master, I\u2019m not that special. I\u2019ve just had plenty of challenges, and chose to take them on as they came. The biggest difference you can make in your life is by choosing to face challenges.\n\n \n\nThis something I am mastering isn\u2019t one of my main life lessons this \"go around\". That\u2019s probably why it\u2019s been a bit easier for me to face than it is for others. Because it\u2019s not a specific challenge I set up for myself in this life, it doesn't trigger me the way it may trigger others. Vulnerability is one of my life lessons; and I can, and likely will, write all about how hard that was for me. It was like having teeth pulled while riding a bicycle through fire hoops; but I digress....\n\n \n\nI've had an opportunity to master this something because of all the \"bad\" behavior I have witnessed. I've had so much practice. I was BLESSED with SO MUCH PRACTICE. Some of that practice was the karmic result of me being a doormat, some from just witnessing \"bad\" behavior, and some from being wronged. Can anyone guess what lesson I am mastering?\n\n \n\nForgiveness.\n\n \n\nForgiveness is hard. Forgiveness is often harder to go through than the actual act we are trying to forgive. Regardless of how spiritual, grounded, or rational one may be- it seems nearly impossible to maintain a benevolent attitude when someone hurts us. Have you noticed that? That one moment we can be skipping down the road, throwing glitter over our heads, smiling, singing, \u201cEverything is Beautiful\u201d until someone reaches out to trip us. Our narrative changes pretty rapidly, doesn\u2019t it!?\n\n \n\n\u201cHow dare they trip me?! What type of person DOES that? What kind of world do we live in?!\u201d\n\n \n\nAdrenaline, what are you going to do?\n\n \n\nAny time a human being\u2019s brain believes it is in danger, it releases adrenaline. It\u2019s a neurochemical magic trick we have up our sleeves that helps us escape bears, and protect ourselves from harm if we need too. Here\u2019s the problem with that: there\u2019s not a lot of bears around anymore, nor is our westernized species in actual real danger on a regular basis anymore. Do you agree? Our brain hasn\u2019t really evolved past the \u201cbeing chased by bears\u201d days, and it doses us with adrenaline in situations we don\u2019t really need it. But wait, it gets better\u2026\n\n \n\n\"In a scientific paper published in the Journal of Neuroscience, QBI's Dr Louise Faber and her colleagues have demonstrated how noradrenaline, the brain's equivalent of adrenaline, affects the amygdala by controlling chemical and electrical pathways in the brain responsible for memory formation.\n\n\u201cThis is a new way of understanding how neurons form long term memories in the amygdala,\u201d Dr Faber said.\n\n\u201cOur strongest and most vivid human memories are usually associated with strong emotional events such as those associated with extreme fear, love and rage.\u201d (Read full article here)\n\n \n\nAn adrenaline dump in your brain immediately starts storing the information you are receiving as memory. This is also a neurochemical magic trick; and it\u2019s mostly great! For instance, if you try to cross the road without looking both ways, and you almost get hit by a car, you\u2019re going to remember that. Not only are you going to remember, that memory will be powerfully SEARED into your brain. Great! You learned to not walk in front of a car. Fabulous.\n\n \n\nHow this magic trick works against us is that this magic trick happens in non-dangerous situations, makes us believe we are in danger, AND makes us remember non-dangerous things forever as dangerous!\n\n \n\nIf someone makes fun of you, really gets your goat, you\u2019re likely going to get an adrenaline dump. Now you believe the person who teased you is dangerous. Your reptilian brain says, \"This person is dangerous, avoid this person forever, fear this person.\" At no point does your brain say, \"Oh, hey, Johnny was probably having a bad day, you should forgive him.\" The brain doesn\u2019t work like that. Once again, the brain doesn\u2019t work like that. Realistically, maybe it can\u2019t for our own safety, just in case bears become an issue again.\n\n \n\nOf course, there are also people who hurt people who are dangerous. Perhaps there is someone who hurt you (or someone you love) so profoundly they destroyed a life. I do not take that lightly; and I do not want anyone to think I am diminishing incidents of true danger with regards to forgiveness, because I am not. As a cumulative whole, we get lucky in that most of our trangressors aren't murderers, rapists, abusers, etc.; but not everyone has gotten lucky. For those of you who have been affected in this way, you have my empathy; and there is a light at the tunnel for you too. The science behind adrenaline and adrenaline memory storage is vital in treating trauma and PTSD.\n\n \n\nI wanted to offer you an actual physical reason why forgiveness is so hard. Forgiveness is hard because our brain is still stuck in the dark ages. Any time someone hurts us, scares us, or pisses us off, a neurochemical chain reaction occurs within our brain which flags that person as a threat. As a bear. That flag becomes a fixture in our brain, a memory. To forgive someone who hurt you, is quite literally choosing to be in direct opposition to your brain. Not easy! The brain, the CNS, controls our body\u2026.ummmm, kind of hard to oppose that right?\n\n \n\nGuess what? We all own something that controls the brain. The brain controls our body, our psychology, our emotions\u2026 so what do we have that can control the brain? We all have one. We got it for free! Anyone wanna take a guess?\n\n \n\nThe mind. You can control your brain with your mind. Do we usually do that? No, we almost always do that. Yes, you read that correctly, we are almost always controlling our brain with our mind. Sure the brain has some autonomic functions we don\u2019t have to worry about, very handy; but we still use our minds to control our brain often...unconsciously. We have to take a big step into consciousness, take control of our mind, and tell our mind to say, \"Hey brain, there\u2019s no bears, you need to chill out. We need to let go of this fear, because it's killing us.\"\n\n \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of fluffy, flowery, inspirational messages about forgiveness out there.\n\n \n\nForgiveness is for you, not them!\n\n\n \n\nForgiveness will lighten your burden!\n\n\n \n\nForgive from the heart!\n\n\n \n\n \n\nMost of the fluffy stuff is true. Forgiveness does more for the victim than the villain; and forgiveness will release burdens: fear, anger, distrust, anxiety, depression\u2026. However, please do not try to forgive someone from the heart. You\u2019re likely going to fail. Perhaps \"forgive from the heart\" is why so many of us are failing at forgiveness! The perspective that forgiveness is a heart centered act is a bit flawed.\n\n \n\nForgiveness is mind control. All the painful memories you have are not in your heart. They are seared into your brain as a result of a biological function which is present to help us survive\u2026.bears. The reason you can\u2019t forgive your transgressors is because your brain doesn\u2019t want you to! Your brain wants you to survive, and your brain has deemed those transgressors as a threat to your survival.\n\n \n\nHowever, the brain is black and white, and we live in a very colorful world. That\u2019s why we have evolved to having this wonderful thing called \u201ca mind\u201d, so we can evolve to control it. Mind control is human evolution. Forgiveness is evolutionary.\n\n \n\nI won\u2019t encourage you to forgive people because it will lighten your burden, or make you feel better; but I will encourage you to forgive people for your own personal spiritual evolution. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for, right? To evolve. To learn, have experiences, and evolve towards perfection. Sluuuuuurp, to merge with the universe. Yes, learning to control your mind makes you feel better, gives you a better sense of direction, and allows you to attract what you want in life. Yes. That\u2019s great. Yes, learning and practicing forgiveness will help release your negative emotions, and it will clear your vibration of some disharmony. Yes. That\u2019s great. But more importantly, learning to control your mind and practicing forgiveness will help you evolve! This is why we are here.\n\n \n\nI apologize for not writing a fluffy, Hallmark style blog about forgiveness; but let\u2019s be honest, we\u2019ve all had our fill on fluffy, Hallmark forgiveness stuff. Perhaps it was time to switch off to the science stuff to help us understand why it's so difficult to forgive. Maybe this time around, science stuff can be the superhero; and fluffy, Hallmark stuff can take the back seat.\n\n \n\nPs. I have nothing against bears. They are majestic, beautiful creatures; and I adore them.\n\n\nhttps://www.thevesseloceanside.com/single-post/2019/06/20/Who-hurt-you", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43080, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A non-Hallmark view on Forgiveness", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561570439, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c5c37d/a_nonhallmark_view_on_forgiveness/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "world_citizen7", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2o0msjd0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561483626, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c5bzc3/a_simple_exercise_to_test_your_self_value_and/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c5bzc3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 39, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c5bzc3/a_simple_exercise_to_test_your_self_value_and/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561485001, "score": 73, "selftext": "Read each sentence slowly and try your very hardest to believe it.

That two people can read the same thing yet get something completely different out of it?

She asked for my number and we went on a few dates. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA relationship duly followed, and at first it was great, she treated me brilliantly, we got on well, she was kind etc etc we exchanged 'I love yous' and to be honest I couldn't quite believe what was happening. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then it changed and now it's over, it only lasted a few months, and I'm just wondering why all that would happen just for a short whirlwind romance...do you believe in fate or synchronicity?

A mess is shambolic, or a situation that is confused and  full of problems. But still we find it tolerable to go on, even though  for many the journey through life is a great upheaval and undergoing of  adversity, although occasionally beautiful. In fact, it could be said  that we exist in a sort of disharmonious harmony that stops just short of collapsing into an abyss of insurmountable mayhem.\n\nWhat is truly remarkable is that the whole of existence is kept in  balance by an invisible power that is forever present yet never enters  the world. The power is what\u2019s referred to as God or the Divine Being.  Although beyond description, it\u2019s not beyond realising as the Source  within the body from which life arises into sensory awareness. A  question often raised is that, if there is a God, why are so many people  afflicted by poverty, injustice and the apparent random violence which  is widespread on the planet? It\u2019s not God that creates the appalling  conditions and unhappiness \u2013 we human beings have brought it about. The  mess we have made is of our own making and is something that only we can resolve.\n\nIn the first instance this involves being divested of  the emotional negativity within our own bodies. As well as the emotional  hurts and pains we\u2019ve gathered during our own lifetime, we each at  birth have had to take on a portion of the past ignorance of humanity as  a whole. This is the backlog of unconscious past life experience that our forefathers were unable to resolve while alive in the senses. Could  it therefore be that the greatest contribution to humanity is to die  with no emotional baggage as hate, anger or greed so as not to burden  tomorrow\u2019s children as we ourselves have been afflicted?\n\nEach  individual man and woman has the opportunity to clean up their own mess, without blaming anyone or anything for the circumstances of the life.  Responsibility begins with the acceptance of what I\u2019ve been so that I  may be responsible now for what I am. Wisdom is the flowering of the  knowledge of life lived in the world of experience, whereas truth is the  distillation of existence beyond what can be sensibly known. This is to  simply be the timeless emanation of reality. It\u2019s just that the  perception is unable to grasp the profundity of this original state  while focused exclusively on the objective world.\n\nThe price of  being in existence is time itself, for everybody suffers in time. The  mind trap set a long time ago by an intelligence in revolt to the good  of the whole has lured the unsuspecting human race onto a treadmill that  keeps the world spinning. Time\u2019s up when the past catches up with the  present and is no longer an impediment to the fulfilment of being  conscious in a body. The idea of existence is then seen to be glorious,  with the mess unable to contaminate the beauty and integrity of life.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43056, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A Glorious Mess", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561550866, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c57lfn/a_glorious_mess/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "pujashoppe", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_qizvg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561462278, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c57627/efforts_needed_to_establish_as_able_franchisee/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c57627", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c57627/efforts_needed_to_establish_as_able_franchisee/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561462280, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 43057, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Efforts Needed to Establish As Able Franchisee Partner", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561548661, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c57627/efforts_needed_to_establish_as_able_franchisee/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "saiglai", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_nm95j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561460766, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c56uru/why_someone_borns_to_be_bad/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c56uru", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c56uru/why_someone_borns_to_be_bad/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561460766, "score": 1, "selftext": "Ive been thinking alot why someone borns to be bad.

It'll be 100% clean, about motivating the listener and good vibes... If you don't like the change, I love hearing thoughts and opinions on my work, please no blatant disrespect, I appreciate it!\n\nThis journey, living my dream as a musician and label owner and more importantly and my biggest drive, to help people, is.... Beautiful. I thank all you for all the vibes you shared. Good or Bad, We're all alike, we're capable of anything, Us.\nI look back at songs and I'm sometimes unsure if the message is overly inerpreted, to say, someone thinks \"bad vibes\" when a song talking about some crazy sex or thoughts of loosing' my head, those are the moments I want people to look back on, myself included and see how much growth can be made in such a short period of time, ANYONE can do ANYTHING. Don't hold yourself back. You'l learn as you go and have setbacks.... KEEP GOING!!!\nLove you all.\n\n\nI made this today, the song before it on my page is also part of when I for real, WOKE UP, like, out from the darkness and hate....\n\nLink to the song: \nsoundcloud.com/lil2faydd/brushitoff\n\n________\n\nThen I thought:\n\n It may not make the album, but I know what you mean, I tried to make it sound \"like in a dream\" type vibe. Some stuff you'd sleep to, something when you get pissed off, play and be like \"For REAL, brush that BS off\". I don't know how to deal with my older music, it's vibes..... IDK if the vibes are good though.... Morally. Like I love what I make and want people to enjoy it but I don't wanna be a bad influence either.\n\nLike what is the line, what can I say in a song that is going to be perceived as negative... I can make a song. A hit, but I'm in a spiritual place where I don't know if I'm just having a hard time transitioning, or what, but I'm trying to find good vibes, 12 Laws of Nature. Law of attraction, etc. \nI mean, the motive, the vision, is for the future, for the world. So, does that completely disregard what I said earlier or is my music good bad vibes as long as my vision is good vibes?!....\n\nI'm conflicted. Am I thinking to much. \n\nMY OLD MUSIC is on that same page..... aside form the first two songs... ALL the rest are from earlier this month or last month!\n\nI'd appreciate ANY type of constructive comment, even if it's \"you can't post link\" which, I'm not sure if I can but I honestly need to get office or I'll get sucked in....

So many questions.  So many answers out there.  \n\nI mean, part of this whole thing is just letting the questions go, right?  But then again, who says?  I think the questioning is indicative of something deeper... so to a large degree it's not just something we can just push away and act like it doesn't exist.  In fact, in my experience, it's totally necessary that we go into it fully.  Even if we don't exactly get the answer our mind is hankering for.\n\nIn my experience, we never get that certainty or that sort of answer that will put a definitive close on things.  That just doesn't seem to be the nature of life.  But what *do* we get?  We get a sort of intuition... a sort of answer on a deeper level.  It's a heart thing.  It's not necessarily something that will give us that certainty our mind so desires... but it is something that will help us to face the uncertainty of life, and not only to face it, but to embrace it with open arms.\n\nEveryone seems so certain!  Even the spiritualists and the awakened and what not seem so certain, too!  I believe many of them are frauds, but not all of them... some of them do speak to something genuine in me, they do awaken a sort of feeling and love and joy that helps me to face the uncertainty of life with ever-growing gratitude and celebration.  But even these people... what do they know about ME?\n\nThat is the thing... all this talk of enlightenment, awakening, Truth.  And I believe that there is some sort of Universal Truth, I really do... I believe it is the Truth rooted in REALITY.  Alas, how can a dream ever be truly fulfilling?  But I also believe that not everyone has the same way of getting there.  \n\nSo you can throw all that talk of enlightenment, awakening, and Truth out the window.  Who cares what enlightenment means to somebody else?  Who cares what someone's awakening looks like in comparison to mine?  Who cares what someone claims Truth is?  Does it matter?  Does it really matter at all?\n\nAnd I have come to know that...  well, know, no, because I cannot be that certain.  But I have come to FEEL that these things do NOT matter.  The only thing that matters, the way I see it, is finding something that makes MY life more rejoicing, more celebratory.  If it brings me more peace, it is good.  If it brings me more joy, it is good.  If it brings me more love, it is good.  This, for me, is the only criteria.  Even if the whole world disagrees with me, it is of no importance - for I know what it is that I have felt.\n\nAnd guess what?  That includes the right to get it wrong.  So perhaps all these people who speak of Truth are pushing me into greater and greater depths... that much I do not know.  Time will tell.\n\nBut somewhere along the line, we got so concerned with getting it \"right\", that we forgot to live.\n\nSo no... I am not interested in getting it \"right\".  \n\nFor me, I much prefer to get it \"wrong\", and to get it \"wrong\" honestly, than to get it \"right\" and live a lie.\n\nTHIS is the way we develop our intuition.\n\nAnd much more importantly, this is the way that we LIVE.\n\nLife moves pretty fast.

I've done lots of research on spirits and deities, mostly out of a love for mythology, and I grew up Catholic altho I left the church as a teen. I don't have altars, pendants, totems or anything like that. I don't devoutly pray to anyone. I do playfully dedicate extra reps during my workout to Thor, or when I play monster Hunter I'll give it up for Artemis but this is not really expecting anything.\n\nSo I had an interview today for a job involving dogs. Last night I again just playfully asked a pagan deity for a blessing to bring me good luck in the interview. This time I asked Hecate because dogs are one of her patron animals. The others being dragons, cats and storks for the curious.\n\nSo now we get to the dream. In the dream I was in the living area of a house I had never been to. My highschool crush was there for some reason with another girl about my age I didn't recognize. They were uncharacteristically friendly to me. There was also 2 guys wrestling, one large and one kinda scrawny. They nearly bumped into me so I gave them a little shove which sent them flying across the room into a door, crushing the smaller man's head under the weight of the big guy and breaking the door open. Another guy comes out of the room chuckled and said \"noice\". For some reason I ignored that and walked into the room that had been opened. \n\nFrom the outside this room looked like a bedroom but when I stepped through the doorway I found myself in a ball room or something. There were a bunch circular tables, all covered in red tablecloths and people from the house were finding their seats. As I attempted to find my own seat a beautiful woman, blond, red dress, and hourglass figure grabs me, stopping me in my tracks. She circled around to my back, embraced me from behind, and placed her thumbs behind my ears like where you'd place a pen, and plugged both my ears with her index fingers. It was like she had 4 arms. 2 to hold my body and 2 to hold my ears. We then started spinning like a dance but we were becoming weightless and floating. I remember holding her hands and then everything goes black for a second. \n\nNext thing I know I'm in my bedroom looking at this woman except now she's half naked, giving me eyes like we just did something. I look around the room and notice that half the room is the other bedroom I saw from the strange house and a couple cats were coming in through the broken door. When I look back at the woman, she's gone but I still feel her hand on my right ear. I reach up to touch it and it falls to the floor. This indicated to me that the thing on my ear was not her hand and when I look down there's about $60 in US currency on the ground. I picked it up and that's when I woke up.\n\nNow having strange dreams is normal for me on the rare occasion I do dream but considering everything I was preparing for and my request, it just seemed really specifically weird and pretty much every spirit I've ever read about communicates through dreams which is why I thought I'd ask you guys if you think it means anything or maybe I've been reading too many stories.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 42974, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Weird Dream", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561494022, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c4uy3h/weird_dream/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "bradysoul", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9een92b", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561407049, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c4uruv/i_am_lost_and_dont_know_how_to_find_my_way_back/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c4uruv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c4uruv/i_am_lost_and_dont_know_how_to_find_my_way_back/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561407050, "score": 19, "selftext": "I'm currently 19 years old and finished my first year of college. About two years ago, I was struggling with a lot of family issues, and I felt as if I had nobody but myself and my bike to keep me grounded. I discovered meditation and had practiced it for a time. I just liked how it made me feel afterwards. But when I started biking out to the edge of the city at insanely early times in the morning, meditating and focusing inward and releasing all toxic feelings from my body, I started feeling truly happy and content...all the time. I felt an appreciation and understanding for being alive and for whatever is beyond it. I gained an extreme sense of maturity and confidence. It showed too. My relationships improved, I was building friendships at school I didn't think twice about before hand. I was doing very well in school despite having failed multiple classes before then. Life was actually the best it had ever been.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs months passed, the feelings began to slowly fade, but I hardly noticed. I was still routinely waking up early, enjoying the air. Breathing in life as much as I was putting out. When I got to college, that was when it truly began to die out. I was still self-motivated. I made the Dean's honor list this past year, but even as my habits went on such as early mornings, workouts, meditating, and doing things I loved, that spark of light and buzz of purposeful energy and security I once felt was now gone. Now, being the summertime, it is far from gone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel just as bad as I did before this spiritual revelation I had that a couple years ago. I've been trying many things. Doing the activities I did during that time, going to the same places. I've been trying to even remember what it felt like to be in such a blissful state. I don't know what to do, or how to find peace in myself and the world as I once did. I'm addicted to my phone usage and spend days acting like a zombie over feeling every single moment as a blessing. I can only list the major things that have physically changed since then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChanges being: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Getting a part time job\n\n\\- Moving cities\n\n\\- Parents getting new separate homes\n\n\\- being over-productive and burning out (now being more lazy if anything)\n\n\\- partying and abusing substances more in the college lifestyle\n\n\\- becoming more analytical towards everything\n\n\\- becoming dangerously cynical about the world\n\n\\- changing my positive views to realism, which leads me to thinking negatively\n\n\\- Feeling much more lonely, rather than being at peace in solitude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease help me. I'm still slipping, and I haven't let myself fall off some sort of deep end, but I'm as one would call it, dead inside. I can't help but believe I have no meaning.

But unfortunately for you, that's not enough to silence me about my own experiences and opinions on the divine force that some of you call God.\n\nI like to be known as Vixen, I am a starchild with incredible intuition (not to stroke my own ego but seriously it freaks me out how on point I am). I practice tarot and white magick, which will immediately cause some of you to run for the hills or shun me for sinning. Which, to be frank, is ridiculous because you claim that God loves all if the person's intention is pure, and never have I once caused harm to another whilst practicing my craft. \n\nI know this is the card that most \"anti-christian\" people play during the debate, but homosexuality is not a sin. How can love, something pure and beautiful and completely out of our realm of understanding be a sin? I personally believe that it is not so much the act that our Divine Force looks at, but rather the intention behind it.\n\nMotive makes the man. It's something I discussed earlier on today with a Christian man, and he told me that he agrees with me. He's the very first I've had the pleasure of meeting that agrees everybody is entitled to love who they want, have sex with who they want at the time they choose, and make their own decisions, good or bad, for that is the will of \"God\", or the \"Divine Being\", or whatever you call the force that brought us here, and gently pushes us towards the path we are made for. The will of that being is for us to be allowed freedom. \n\nPerhaps even having a concept of sin goes against the plan. But how are we to know? We are not privy to that information. The plan is known only by the Divine, and we are merely students in the lesson of the universe. We have so much left to learn, and I believe that there are so many more ways to go about it than the basic, worship Him and do only good path that many try to make us believe. \n\nI am not bashing any religion, nor those who believe it. I am stating that there are many paths to take, and the one which you are drawn to says a lot about who you are, who you have been, and who you will be. \n\nBasically the less formal message I'm trying to send here is that you should not use religion to excuse your distaste against a certain type of people. If you do not like gay people, accept it. If you are racist, accept it. If you are judgemental of people that do not believe, accept it. Embracing and moving forward is the key to finding out who you are and where your journey shall lead you. \n\nI would love to debate about this as I haven't touched anywhere near as many points as I would have liked to in this, but this is merely an introduction to the way my beautiful, twisted mind perceives the world.\n\nWe all deserve love and happiness - and second chances.

confused about the universe and its ways as I am... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm looking - or better said- practically exploring the idea of what is called an \"open relationship\" aka we are together though we have the freedom to sexually explore ourselves together with other people outside of our relationship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've been together for over 2 years now, and our story started with him being the reflection of what I had been looking for for the longest time - deeply sensitive, open to true attachment, intense, understanding, protective and wiser and wieser as time went by. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, he mirrors my shadow self and I mirror his. Which leads to explosive arguments and fights, which we are now slowly learning to build into constructive exchanges, not exchanges where we just hurt each other with words we dont mean. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion, there is an overarching significance to this relationship. We have overcome obstacles within ourselves as well as external ones together, which others would not feel comfortable/be open to do . I therefore consider that we have such a stable foundation which goes deeper than anything we can both describe, in order to go through this life together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, there is one aspect which we knew from the start and which we postponed until it decided to come out by itself more intensly and clearly than ever before -  Sex, and not only sex between the two of us but our individual experiences with it. I, (the woman) had more partners than he had, although I am younger than him. I met him at the time, when after overcoming his great introvertion, he was out discovering this side of the world. And I - so to say- took him and made him mine of course with his approval and most open heart, but i basically took him out of it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd through that i think i interfered with his journey of discovering his sexual self. We both possess very instense sexual energy and were able to exchange it in the most satisfying and beautful way the first 2 years, but now it has faded? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt had \"faded\" in the sense that I believe we surpressed our sexual energies by holding on to the idea that we SHOULD only have sex with each other, that we SHOULD only experience this side with each other- a whole bunch of SHOULD instead of what we felt. What we felt was specifically a very big disconnection between each other due to us forcing ourselves to live by \"shoulds\" in an effort to not hurt each other (aka hurt our egos). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd after completely breaking down last night and getting to \"my lowest\" (which i only experienced at very dark points in my life) after months of thinking and analyzing this through, I put the follwing previously known  but never connected pieces of information together: \n\n1. The ego is the one that wants to keep our partner to ourselves and does anything to keep it this way even though this causes suffering to the loved one \n2. The ego is afraid of change and most greatly of change that even goes towards societal programming (marriage, exclusive relationships, should get married if pregnant and etc) and will do anything - even break the relationship that you strive so much to bring to fulfillment- to keep the sense of false security and false possession. \n3. Not sure if ego, maybe childhood trauma or sth similar, but one of these keeps you afraid of an \"open relationship\" due to the fear of getting abandoned, feeling unworthy and feeling unwanted. This is surely my biggest problem, my biggest fear. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm posting this here to open a discussion because I'm not sure that the realizations I made are real or if I'm literally only convincing myself that this right because I dont want to accept that our relationship may very well be over. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd this is exactly where I'ms tuck right now: Why should our relationship be called \"over\" because he wants to experience something that I myself would want to experience had i not already done so? What is the clear breaking up point ? Is there a right breaking up point or is it to each their own? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I falsley convinving myself of a false truth in order to sooth my ego or am I experiencing a major breakthrough in our relationsip and most important in ego work? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this! I hope that some out there can relate and maybe clarifiy some toughts or simply state personal opinions/views.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 42944, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "\"Open-Relationships\" and Ego Work - Path to a higher vibrational union", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561462825, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c4m7g3/openrelationships_and_ego_work_path_to_a_higher/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "thatNBAguyFIERI", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_zrnoh4i", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561370802, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c4l2tl/how_do_i_actually_open_my_third_eye/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c4l2tl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 31, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c4l2tl/how_do_i_actually_open_my_third_eye/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561370803, "score": 16, "selftext": "My mind is clouded and I just seek clarity and power as well energy from the empowerment of opening my third eye.\n\nI have looked through many videos on how to do it ,but everyone kind of dances around it.\n\nI want to know how to open my third eye so I can unlock my true happiness and be able to bring happiness and clarity into other peoples lives.\n\nPlease give your suggestions as I search for purpose and motivation", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 42939, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How do I actually open my third eye", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561458524, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c4l2tl/how_do_i_actually_open_my_third_eye/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "DeADLYxDOVe94", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_39c2s1ra", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561364186, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c4k3lr/i_promise_that_no_matter_how_hard_things_are_the/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 1}, "id": "c4k3lr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c4k3lr/i_promise_that_no_matter_how_hard_things_are_the/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561364188, "score": 21, "selftext": "No matter how hard things get, don\u2019t lose yourself no matter how lost you feel.

I used to let family tell me the things I like to do will never take me any where and that I\u2019ll never accomplish anything unless I go to college and get an education to pursue something I would never enjoy doing because I was put on a pedestal and idealized for some body I\u2019m not.

It\u2019s especially sad that only when I started to want to leave my home, my family started to appreciate the things I\u2019ve been passionate about my entire life and it sucks because it felt like they were to late a long with hard ships outside of my family circle that crumbled sone of the goals and dreams I had. The energy that was given off to me was set in motion and I would only feel sad and never enough for the things I love to do. The day I realized I could pursue my passions and that they were obtainable was only a year ago. I started investing money in music equipment and found my old capture card that I wanted to record and edit clips with for video games I love to play while living with the same people who used to look down upon those passions I loved. I had it all set up and was learning how to work each of the software programs. I ran into many issues along the way from the capture card producing poor quality for live streaming and distorted lines and my microphone for my music equipment had stopped working out of no where but I know these are obstacles to overcome. My physical being wants to be frustrated by these obstacles to the point where it affects my motivation but I know that on another level these obstacles are nothing. Even though I\u2019m having a hard time thinking outside of the box I will overcome it and you will as well. Please pursue your passions and trust in the universe.

It involved smoking some weed and hanging out with 2 of my buddies, one of which is my guitar teacher. I don\u2019t smoke very often anymore so I just took 1 massive bong rip and was fairly baked.

This kid I\u2019m friends with and who I\u2019m standing right next to, Devon, (not gonna disclose his last name) is gonna be a famous guitar player. It was a sense as if I could tell this dudes future, and that when he is famous I\u2019m gonna be so proud and be able to say I knew that guy. I might be crazy and completely talking out of my ass, but that\u2019s how it really felt. And sense I\u2019m a very big believer of spirituality now, I\u2019m kinda trusting it. I believe one of my friends is seriously gonna be a rockin band and a respected guitar player around a few to maybe 10 years from now.

My friends noticed last night that I seemed kinda star struck and upset I just told them I wasn\u2019t and that I was just sensing something big, and it made me so happy.

I see a lot of people have a hard time w this in these sort of subreddits so I hope my experience can help. \n\nI had a spiritual awakening initially through psychedelics, meditation, and therapy a few years back. Looking back (through a biased lens I\u2019m sure) I felt a sense of awakening, fascination, motivation, bliss, cultivation of faith, and dramatic healing. People around me noticed and came to me for advice and company. It felt good. I felt like I was truly experiencing stages of enlightenment and continued to cultivate these feelings for years. I still had hard moments - my parents divorce, abusive bosses, a dramatic moving out, and all the other general hard life stuff of your early 20s. But I still felt this net positive. \n\nRecently these sort of feelings have faded. I found myself rolling my eyes at spiritual teachings that once made me cry tears of happiness. I completely lost faith in meditation as something I should do, I fell back into deeply addictive patterns, and all that good stuff. It *mostly* felt like I had just reverted to a pre-awakening state. However, there was the memory of this previous period that gave me faith that it would be ok. Once I recognized this, I just let the suffering and world take me. I let go of any feeling of \u201cI ought to meditate\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be struggling with x or y\u201d etc. I just let myself be the way I was. And I\u2019m okay. I didn\u2019t \u201cfall off the track\u201d or lose my way. I realized that this period is just as spiritually significant as the one before it. Less flashy and blissful and exciting, but just as important if not more. It gave me a lot of perspective on other people suffering too. During my initial awakening period, I definitely had the view of \u201cwow my friend sure is depressed, why doesn\u2019t he just meditate or listen to this lecture?\u201d Now I lived in a world where I had done all of that - I had all my memories and experiences with deep spirituality and I was still struggling. I saw myself in all of my friends I had previously had a judgmental confusion about. I realized I had to go through these darker sides of my soul with all my renewed perspective so I could look at them more compassionately. \n\nLet yourself go through these dark periods. Don\u2019t fight them if they feel inevitable. You will survive. You will reinforce your faith or belief. You will come out stronger and more well rounded. Let yourself live in your neuroses and bad habits. Just keep awareness. You can\u2019t ever forget where you\u2019ve been. These hard experiences are just as spiritual and will have a huge impact on your life. \n\nAnd of course, continue doing your best to heal. During this period I continued therapy and used CBD, but I didn\u2019t latch onto the idea that I should be super happy and not have any problems. \n\nHope some of you at least found this interesting if not relatable!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 42880, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "It\u2019s okay (and I recommend) to let yourself experience anxiety, depression, stress, sadness, confusion, and loss of faith after a period of spiritual awakening and bliss", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561452611, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c48n88/its_okay_and_i_recommend_to_let_yourself/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "Discreet_Troll", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_32g9fsir", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561308254, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/c47haz/keeping_it_together_about_10_years_in/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c47haz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/c47haz/keeping_it_together_about_10_years_in/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561308255, "score": 1, "selftext": "I keep it together fine, after I became a sociopath and was grateful to myself for my diminishing emotional spectrum.  Years of torment and insanity wore on my humanity, I just became more of an animal inside.  My sympathy with people continues to diminsh as well but I still have some social needs.  A therapist and psychiatrist are not the outlet I prefer.  The animalistic and desturctive nature of people had become more and more evident and amusing to me.\n\nMy identity was compromised over time and I started to experience problems in the public.  I was attacked a few time, I had recieved countless death threats and continued hostility.  I beat a few kids asses, I have no idea what those boys were thinking.  I resent resorting to hostility, but they attacked me and I reacted.  I'm glad I did not waste one of those kids.  I don't go out very much anticipating taking a bullet in the head.  People are pure fucking trash in towns always.  Peddlin, looking to get hooked up, regular hookers.  Put a bad taste in my mouth.  I must stop kissing strange girls.  When I leave the house I'm usually ready to rock and, just, small town.\n\nIt's been quite a thrill at times but I do not understand why so much hostility was directed at me, I am not the problem or bad guy.  I was the one that was targeted and was trying to intelligently defend myself and accrue evidence to use toward my saboteurs.  I am not an arrogant prick.\n\nI had experience several paranormal incidents involving the gods and things.  I was unable to acquire evidence and no one else seemed to either.  It is important if you see God flying around or something you take a picture of him. \n\nReligious dogma's and fanaticism had been a real pickle for me.  I am not self important in these incidents.  I was a bystander as well as everyone else in the pathology of these demons or gods.  \n\nOver time I was trying to figure out if I was delusional or mentally defective.  I was often under the influence of cough syrup and enjoy cough medicine and playing video games.  It was part of my delirium but I was not entirely delusional. I mean, I was aware I was diluted, I meant to humor people.  Bible thumping at work really makes things difficult.  \n\nI do not sympathize with myself or pity myself.  Sometimes it doesn't matter whether you're wrong or right or innocent.  I was being attacked and there was nothing to understand.  These beings seem quite animalistic at times.  I am animalistic as well but have been able to keep it more civil than most of us.\n\nName drops became a problem.  I can't even explain what is going on.  I'm glad to see some people have turned up that were starting to sound like they knew what was going on.\n\n\n\n\nWell, take care.

The 'oneness' of everything carries with it an implication: that it is less than one if any one thing within it were to be removed. Therefore, the universe understands how important you are as a living piece of its structure, how important everyone is. You are so important that without you, nothing can have intrinsic purpose, for what is the 'soul' without the 'body'? And what is the 'body' without the 'soul'? What would your soul do if you weren't around to be guided through Eternity? I'll tell you. It would wish that you *were* around because without you, it knows it is nothing, because you are a part of it's very being, just like how, without cells, the body is nothing since they too are a part of it's very being. In this regard, everything is One, for everything's ability to do anything in this world is predicated on every other thing's ability to do anything; we all need each other\u2014bodies/souls; cells/molecules. If even the electrons buzzing around you suddenly lost their charges, and stopped functioning as they should, physicality would collapse. And, the same can be said about the your physical being from the perspective of the soul. Your ability to be the best version of yourself (to function divinely) actually means something. Your soul is absolutely invested in you. It all is; the entire expanse of creation is invested in you, for You are it, and it is You. The ultimate goal of your life, then, is to get to a point where you actually want to *live it.* Because, why else are you here? You are not here to *leave*. You are not here to *escape*. You are not here to seek refuge in *safety.* You are here to rediscover yourself as an intrinsic Element of Eternity, as you have always been, and as you forever shall be.
