I manage to get about 3 to 4 hours of sleep at max lately as she was what made me feel comfortable at night.. But last night's dream was different. I dreamed she was there with me cuddled beside me on my bed, And I couldn't believe it (at the time i hadn't known i was dreaming). So I picked her up like I usually did and tried to show my parents, But they couldn't see her in my arms. Where as I was able to feel her weight, fur, heart beating gently All that. After a few moments she looked up a bit at me and did her little smile-looking face. I felt happy i guess. And I woke up feeling more calm and rested than usual...

Also, it is partly because\u00a0God(Infinite) can be explained and understood in Infinite ways. Each group or branch has closed itself to any input from other realizations.\u00a0 The ultimate realization of\u00a0God\u00a0is an individual achievement not based on any organization, church, denomination, group, etc.\u00a0 Spiritual beings are not chosen by men (organizations, etc.).\u00a0God\u00a0chooses those He wills.\n\nLastly, this confusion and separation among humanity in the spiritual level is because of those (intellectual spiritualists) who have created dogmas which have resulted in many sects and cults born out of each religion and/or mystical experience(s).\u00a0 Whatever separates man from man, or for that matter any part of the universe from any other part, is not from\u00a0God.\u00a0\u00a0God\u00a0unifies;\u00a0ego\u00a0(intellect\u00a0without spirit) divides.\n\nEvery explanation and mystical experience has some truth.\u00a0 Each of these truths appeal only to some people.\u00a0 However, the whole is the sum total of all and more.\u00a0 The ultimate truth is personal experience.\nThen there is another disciplinary body that is trying to unveil the truth behind the universe through experimental studies, the sciences.\u00a0 They have presented one powerful tool to this process: verification of each theory by observation, reasoning, and scientific experiments through scientific tools (models, machines, theories, etc.).\u00a0 However, science can only go so far. Science can only explain the universe to the brink of the physically manifested universe and spirit.\u00a0 Then it reaches a point where scientific experiments and observations no longer are possible. Science no longer can explain!\n\nScientists can verify the different forces working in the universe and/or particles existing, but where these forces have come from they cannot explain.\u00a0 They see a logical and explainable manifested universe but what or who is this logic behind it, they cannot know. If they cross this point and call this logic, \"God,\" then they pass the threshold of science and spirit.\u00a0 They are no longer accepted as scientists; they have entered the realm of the mystics.\n\nHowever, science and Spirit (God) are as close now as they ever have been in known history.\u00a0 There is a very thin layer separating them.\u00a0 Even this layer has been shattered by many who have started to see or have seen these two as One.\u00a0 Many scientists have reached a point where they have begun to accept a unified base for the manifested universe.\u00a0 They realize that there is a single Law (God) operating the whole creation.\u00a0 The mystics are also accepting science as a way to verify the truth behind the manifested universe.\u00a0 However, the ultimate step which would make these two One has not yet become universal.\n\nOne of the aims of\u00a0THOTH\u00a0(The Holiest Of The Holies) is to bring the spirit (mystery) and science (practical verification of creation) together.\n\nBesides the mystics who have had direct experience with the\u00a0spiritand the scientists who have reached the threshold between the spirit and manifested universe, there are also others.\n\nThere are those who are called religious people.\u00a0 They are suspicious of any scientific explanations or anything which is not according to their dogmatic beliefs.\u00a0 The scientists are logical and beyond emotional bounds.\u00a0 The mystic is sure and detached from any dogmatic fury.\u00a0 However, those with dogmas are emotional and easily aroused and/or manipulated.\n\nThere are also many who claim they have had direct experience in thespirit, or claim they are chosen, but are not.\u00a0 These can be a great obstacle in the path of a seeker of the truth.\u00a0 These claims stem from nothing but\u00a0ego.\u00a0 That is why it has been said, \"Beware of\u00a0false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves\" (Matthew 7:15).\u00a0 Every individual has the power to experience\u00a0God.\u00a0 When such an experience occurs, purity will permeate from the person, which is beyond\u00a0ego.\u00a0 Such people then can teach\u00a0God\u00a0(mysteries).\n\nNow the question can arise: What is the role of the great religions of the world?\u00a0 It is here that the concept of\u00a0Messiah\u00a0comes into play.\u00a0 There have been many great mystics and religious beings, but few have come to establish a great religion in the world or reveal a great truth to humanity.\u00a0 These great spokesmen have appeared in the last six thousand years or so.\n\nThere usually is a long period of prophecy of their coming.\u00a0 It is to distinguish them from any other ordinary spiritual event or claim.\u00a0 Also it is to prepare humanity for each step of the revelation of a Master Plan.\n\nThis Master Plan has been formulated to be revealed gradually to humanity.\u00a0 It is a seven-step path which reveals an\u00a0Eternal Truth\u00a0for humans to progress to their ultimate Goal.\u00a0 Each part of this Plan has been revealed to humanity by the\u00a0Christ\u00a0(Messiah); the culmination or synthesis of this Plan is revealed in\u00a0THOTH.\n\nPrior to the last twelve thousand years, man had the knowledge of spiritual powers.\u00a0 He was able to manipulate them.\u00a0 However, he did not follow the\u00a0Eternal Truth\u00a0which had been revealed to him in order to keep creation in its purity and harmony.\u00a0 He misused his powers and knowledge.\u00a0 That is why he failed, and that is when great disasters befell him.\n\nIt was then that it was decided to create human history, and only guide him spiritually by revealing the truth of this\u00a0Eternal Path\u00a0during the last twelve thousand years.\u00a0 This path has been recognized and existed from (in) eternity.\u00a0 It is a path of\u00a0spirit.\u00a0 So it is\u00a0Divine.\u00a0 That is the reason it is called the\u00a0Eternal Divine Path.\n\nThis seven-step path,\u00a0Eternal Divine Path, is revealed to humanity in the form of a sign,\u00a0The Greatest Sign.\u00a0 In this sign not only have the seven stages of the\u00a0Eternal Divine Path\u00a0been crystallized, but it is shown that each step in the path is the focal point of one of the great religions of the world.\n\nThe first step in this path is concerned with all the\u00a0Mystical Paths, which explain the relationship between man and\u00a0God\u00a0(universe).\u00a0 These teachings are the ancient wisdom that has come to us.\u00a0 This first seal also covers those religions that are based on mystical experiences (such as\u00a0Buddhism,\u00a0Hinduism, Cabbala, Sufism, etc.).\u00a0 The understanding of this first seal (step) is the spirit of all religions.\n\nThe next six steps each represent one great religion or revelation that has been revealed to humanity.\u00a0 Each of them are explained to represent one truth, which when all six are put together with the first step (mystical understandings), reveals the whole process of theEternal Divine Path.\n\nThe Greatest Sign\u00a0also explains Creation and History, reveals the essence of \"Be\"-ing (God) and much more.\u00a0 The whole teaching inTHOTH\u00a0evolves around\u00a0The Greatest Sign\u00a0and is based on It.\u00a0 Still new realizations can be recognized about\u00a0The Greatest Sign\u00a0as a person meditates on It.\u00a0 It can be Infinitely explained.\n\nThe Greatest Sign\u00a0not only reveals the\u00a0Eternal Divine Path, but also unifies all the religions of the world.\u00a0 So It unifies humanity.\u00a0 Even if a person calls himself an atheist or an agnostic, they most probably believe in science.\u00a0\u00a0THOTH\u00a0and\u00a0The Greatest Sign\u00a0can even help them to see the Logic behind science.\u00a0 In short, if one is open, and is not closed by believing in a set of dogmas, he can see\u00a0God\u00a0in the universe.\u00a0 Then all humans can be unified under Him.\n\nThe shape of\u00a0The Greatest Sign\u00a0has been designed to be built as a Temple.\u00a0 This will accelerate the unity of all of humanity.\n\nBesides unification of all religions of the world and mystical knowledge, it has also been foretold that\u00a0God's Kingdom will come to earth at the end of this era (world).\u00a0 The sign of such a longing can be seen all throughout the earth.\n\nThe dawn of a new era has been felt by millions. The signs of the end of the old era are apparent in every corner of the earth. This new era is not to return to the old, but to combine the old and the new to a synthesized (whole) way of life.\u00a0 The new era is the time of realizing and implementing the ancient truths combined with new technology (with the use of natural, renewable, and pollution-less resources) to improve the life of man.\u00a0\u00a0The new technology will free man from the mundane.\u00a0 The ancient truths will guide him to the Goal.\n\nThis new way of life necessitates a new system to make it workable.\u00a0 This new era can neither exist based only on diversity and the decentralized mode of the agricultural era, nor on the centralized, unified notion of the industrialized period.\n\nThe coming of the new era will be more diverse than the agricultural period, but will be highly connected to the rest of humanity or even the universe.\u00a0 This system, therefore, has not only to recognize and accommodate for this diversity, but also to maintain the unity between the complex, interrelated components existing on earth.\n\nThat is why the uniqueness of every individual and community has to be recognized, by allowing them to function based on their desired (designed) destiny and culture.\u00a0 However, each and every community will also be connected through their need to participate in the system.\u00a0 This allows diversity to exist in the unified body of humanity.\u00a0 The inter-relationship between them, in the long run, will gradually bring a unified and greater culture on earth.\n\nTo present such a system is another main purpose of\u00a0THOTH.\u00a0This system is an integral part of the\u00a0Eternal Divine Path\u00a0and\u00a0The Greatest Sign\u00a0(Second Seal).\u00a0 This system will bring justice to All.\u00a0Justice is closest to the Heart of\u00a0God.\n\nThe\u00a0Messiah\u00a0(Christ), a true Saint (Mystic), or anyone who is One withGod, has the\u00a0Grace\u00a0of\u00a0God\u00a0with him.\u00a0 Salvation is possible only through His\u00a0Grace.\u00a0 Such people, through His\u00a0Grace, can each lead a person to Him (salvation).\n\nTogether\u00a0The Greatest Sign, the\u00a0Eternal Divine Path, and\u00a0THOTH,\u00a0Is the ultimate manifestation of\u00a0Christ.\u00a0 They are the sum total of all there IS.\u00a0 They not only lead an individual to\u00a0God, but also the whole of humanity collectively.\u00a0\u00a0God\u00a0alone Is Salvation.\u00a0Amen.\n\n\nMaitreya", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 55306, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Mystery of the Seven Seals", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567663221, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/czgv3q/the_mystery_of_the_seven_seals/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "reachnout2cyberspace", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_30hgnrxg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567576011, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/czgqrm/help/", "gildings": {}, "id": "czgqrm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/czgqrm/help/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567576012, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi, I haven\u2019t felt inclined to post on here for awhile...but for the past couple of months I have been feeling this \u201cblock\u201d getting bigger and bigger.

I instantly was drawn to him and noticed his presence. \nHe is so fucking cool. He looks like a mix of Snoop Dogg and Bob Marley with luscious dreads and the most graceful stride. I saw him a couple of times around campus (at Boulder) and everytime I was kind of at a loss for words. Butbi didn't think much of it and just thought he was one of those people you see regularly on campus. \n\nOne night I had a dream he was riding a red bike over a hill, the dream was super vivid and comforting. The next day I saw him. On campus. riding the red bike. \nSo I tell my friend Natalie about this magical man I keep seeing cause holy shiiit now it's a little weird. \n\nFast forward probably about two weeks. \nMy friends and I were hanging out and we are biiiiig stoner girls. That night we were bummed because we were fresh out of weed goods (if you know the struggle you know the struggle) but our night turned around when my friend decided to look through all the empty containers, and ended up finding a couple of gummies and a just enough bud to last us the night. \nWe were so happy and confused because we are whores for weed so no weed ever gets left behind. Where did it come from?! But we rolled with it and smoked it.\nAfter smoking Natalie and I decide to dip and walk home. On our walk home I see him, my spirit guide!! I hit Natalie and I'm like thats him! And she immediately knew who I was talking about. As we walk home he was walking directly on the other side of the street but going the same direction. Even from across the street I could feel his presence and felt like he was acknowledging mine. So we're walking home and he's walking at the same exact place in graceful strides and I kid you not- every traffic light we walk up to turns immediately to walk as soon as he got near. There are at least 5 and Boulder is a heavily trafficy area so usually you have to wait for the light. So at this point I'm convinced not only is he a magical spirit guide but also our weed fairy so thank you universe \n\nIt gets even crazier\n\nSo now I decide to tell my other friends alyssa and Lauren about this person I keep randomly seeing (It would always be in different places) and they are pretty mind blown. \nAlyssa left to go out of town but I was hanging out with lauren, smoking bong on the back porch, and as we're heading inside I SEE HIM walking in the alley behind their house. I was looking down at him from the 2nd story and he was striding beautifully with a huge smile on his face just looking around. I've never seen such a magical human with the most beautiful smile\nLauren saw him too and knew it was him from my reaction alone\n\nI see him a couple days later AGAIN walking down the alley after smoking but I was by myself \n\nFast forward about 2 weeks of not seeing spiritual Snoop Dogg\nI was at the swimming and hanging out at the creek with a really cool guy I've been hanging out with.\nIt's a beautiful sunny day we're kind of high and there is he walking towards us with a small drum set attached to his waist playing the most beautiful ryhthm I have ever heard \nCrazy shit, was that his his blessing!? Probably.\n\nAlyssa was back in town at this point and I tell her about that encounter. Two days later she sees him (my guide) Dead ass.\nShe was walking to work but forgot something and had to run back inside. When she left again she saw him in the alley. This was her first time seeing him and she immediately knew it was him. He has the most amazing presence it takes your breath away. If anyone can levitate it's this guy.\nSo Alyssa waves to him and she said he gave her the biggest smile and friendliest wave ever. Like ever. \nShe said he was pure happiness \nShe texted me freaking out after and now she recognizes him as our spirit guide (we both read the book journey of souls- higgghly reccomend)\n\nA couple of days later Alyssa and I were at work and mildly stoned and we were supposed to pick up a delivery of drinks from the square outside.\nSomeone else was supposed to do the pick up but they called off sick so we were put onto it. My phone died and when I charged it I had a text from my boss saying to pick it up early, which I didn't see until after we picked it up on time. As we were walking outside to pick up the stuff we saw him! No fucking joke he was walking towards us and walked super close by as we were freaking out. He was wearing beautifully colored traditional African garb.

I knew that my spirit guide was trying to tell me something but I couldn't figure out what.  I had also been trying to question who my guide is because it seemed like they knew me very personally.  The number 11 became so pervasive in my life, I just couldn't ignore it.  I began taking photos and screen shotting the 11's just to prove that I wasn't making it up in my head. \n\nI decided to give up drinking 5 days ago.  I've always drank, since I was 13.  I don't know a day without it.  However, I had a day where I was absolutely sabotaging my entire life with my drinking.  So I decided I needed to quit.  After quitting drinking I started to have very vivid dreams.  One of the dreams, my Pop-pop visited me and gave me a hug.  It was emotional because I felt like he was really there.  He passed away when I was 8 so I really almost forgot about him.. \n\nI had begun seeing the 11's again and was questioning where they were coming from and what they were for.  I thought about other spirit guides I have in my life and how they communicate with me.  For instance, my aunt communicates to me with bugs.  Ironically, right before I made the realization of who was communicating with me through numbers, I had SO many bugs flying into my ears.  It became annoying and again wasn't understanding why all these bugs were flying into my ears.  Now I understand she was trying to help me realize who else has been trying to communicate with me.  \n\nIt then hit me like a lightening bolt, it was my Pop-pop who was communicating to me through the numbers.  He was trying to tell me to chill out on the drinking (and other terrible life decisions I was making).  I believe he came to thank me once I had clarity from my drunken mind.  As SOON as I came to this realization, the the amount of 11's that flashed in front of me was mind boggling.  I was overwhelmed with a feeling of relief and joy to know that he's still there looking out for me.  It did not occur to me that my PopPop could be my spirit guide as he wasn't all that spiritual himself.

They say that the place/s you're able to visit in the astral is a reflection of your level of spirituality. It has something to do with your chakras too. So for example, your root chakra is the energy center for safety. It's the chakra that needs to be balanced if you do not feel grounded or safe. So it's possible that when you AP and always end up in a place where you feel threatened or unsafe, you have to work on your root chakra. \n\nWhere your astral body comes out from when you project also determines your most active chakra. For example, the first time I APd, i knew it was through my third eye chakra. I also felt scared not only because it was the first time but fear or intense fear is an indication of a blocked third eye. I also see indigos everywhere. Indigo is the color of third eye.\n\nThe third time I attempted to AP, i felt my astral body coming out through my heart chakra. So in my opinion, balancing our chakras is one of the most important things to do if we want to have a more positive AP experience. \n\nOf course, we all have different beliefs. This is just my take as lately, I can initiate AP best through meditation. Good luck, loves.

Rest is best when you are feeling overwhelmed. When you heal, your counterpart heals. It's a constant flow of equal energy exchange. Take care of you and the rest will follow. It is a time to move into your souls purpose. Take that step. Again..when you move towards your heart's desires, so does your counterpart. Align with your soul. Whatever it is you've been holding back on..dead end jobs..ideas that you aren't exploring. It is time to break the chains. When you align with your souls purpose, you will be supported in so many ways. Have faith. Divine timing. Not OUR timing. Rest assured that all is well. Your connection is right where it needs to be. This is YOUR connection. Don't compare your connection to others. You really aren't waiting. You are healing, evolving, coming into your own so when the timing is right, you WILL be reunited with your beloved. Enjoy the moment. Enjoy the magic.

In other words, all sacrifices which are meant for material advancement in life should be given up, but sacrifices that purify one's existence and elevate one to the spiritual plane should not be stopped. Everything that leads to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness must be encouraged. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also it is said that any activity which leads to devotional service to the Lord should be accepted. That is the highest criterion of religion.

If one renounces such activities, it is to be understood that he is acting in the mode of darkness.\n\nQuestion 1 : FITB : a sanny\u0101s\u012b may perform a marriage ceremony to help his disciple \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\nQuestion 2 : What kind of renunciation is said to be in the mode of ignorance ?\n\n**Related Pic :** [gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/7](https://gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/7)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 55119, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 18.7", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567580554, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cz1dwh/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_187/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mayallurbaconburn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2pacmha0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567493669, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cz1bgo/i_have_an_unwanted_spirit_attached_to_me_how_can/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cz1bgo", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cz1bgo/i_have_an_unwanted_spirit_attached_to_me_how_can/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567493670, "score": 2, "selftext": "It is clouding my judgement so bad....", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 55117, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I have an unwanted spirit attached to me.

We come here so we can lose our selves to rediscover our selves\u2026 sounds silly because we already found our selves in the other side. We knew our self. Never ending constant knowledge of self. There is no reason to run away from the original self just to rediscover it... we always had it. Its going in circles. We live to find challenges and then we die. Around and around we go. In the after life there is other means of gaining knowledge. The very some knowledge that we get here. We can talk to others and tell them show you how it is to be mentally ill or to hurt someone. That spirit can show you or even put you in a scenario where you will see how it is to hurt someone or to be mentally ill. Then in a spit second your done. ALL knowledge gained. NOT necessary to come here. I mean do you really need to eat poo to know its not good to eat? Or can you take a spirits word for it. Eh? You see? \n\nWe can also learn vicariously as a spirit and observe our relatives and see how it is to be bored or how it is to have problems. Speaking of being bored. Boredom is the number one enemy of the living and dead. Life as a whole living and dead have no rivals, no nemesis's and no one to challenges us. This is were things get sad.. WE HAVE TO CREATE PROBLEMS for us to fight through. That's sad. We have to create things for us to do. Sad. We have to make our own reality's just to learn things we will never use in the other side. Sex? No need. Computer programmer? No need. How to read and write? No need on the other side. We should be content with who we are and remain where we are from. Instead of becoming other people and entering into an alternate psychosis. We are in a psychosis in this world. We are hypnotized to play our roles and follow our life script. That's how it works. If you feel a need to do something or if we have a problem we need to solve it there. And it will be solved fast. \n\nTHE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN LIFE IT SELF... IS THAT THERE IS NO PROBLEM. THAT'S THE PROBLEM... Its our fault we came and we can not blame not one but our selves. I cant blame you for my decision and you cant blame me. its a contradicting thing to complain, but were here so.. In the after life we have anything we need. They make it so welcoming and try and make you feel fulfilled when your there, but we still have the audacity to come and live! In the after life everything that will be known is known. Every emotion and though is there to complete us. All of the human condition is there, but were still here. We need to be content with who we are and remain back at home. That's it. We need to stop running away from our selves. \n\nSpirits come and they get in the livings way. They come here to experience how it is to have emotional problems or family problems. HARD Problems and then they take it out on others. They get angry and upset because there life is not fair, but they chose to experience it! When they do this they add more problems to the world. If these spirits have intentions to come and live a hard life and they do not know if they can handle it the right way. They should not come. They should have common courtesy to their living counter parts and not bring more issues. Have some respect. Don't come if your gonna step on toes. Either accidental or intentional. You are causing emotional dis stress. Before a spirit comes they can see many out comes that their life will lead. They know that their father or mother is prone to be a drug addict or have emotional problems. They know if they are gonna be in a good or poor neighbor hood. They know most, but not all out comes. They know that their life will be hard in some areas and they know they can be driven insane by this and take it out in society.

Without it, one is left with only charity and relative bliss. Empathy is the source of psychic ability, including telepathy and manifestation. Reality is a projection of your subconscious, and subjective experience is a hallucination created from partial data input. There is much more to reality than we can perceive, and the source of creation is unknowable. When faced with divinity, our brains hallucinate a default interpretation of this new type of data, often based on the culture we were raised in. Because of this, Christians legitimately see Jesus Christ, while Muslims legitimately see Muhammad and so on. \n\nThe keys to happiness are the delay of gratification, the embrace of suffering, and the death of ego. These themes are known throughout religion, psychology, and many other movements. According to our theories, being born again in Christ is the same as having a spiritual cleansing experience with beings on a DMT trip, or experiencing enlightenment through meditation. What a Christian might call \u201cwalking with god\u201d, might also be considered following the Tao, or following your Dharma, or simply living \u201cin the zone\u201d in an atheistic sense. \n\nThe better your flow and the more actions you take, the more synchronicities you\u2019ll experience, and the easier and more joyous life will become. You may experience small miracles, and will become more sensitive to the data that you are interpreting. At a certain point you may even start to experience reality-bending glitches, but don\u2019t panic. If you can reach this point, begin to document your experiences, and take as many data points as possible. When we have multiple people experiencing the same synchronicities we\u2019ll will begin official experiments as a group. \n\nThe goal of this group in regards to spirituality is first and foremost to bring enlightenment to as many people as possible. The ego death can change people\u2019s lives, and everyone deserves to know what life\u2019s potential can be like. Second, our goal is to study the nature of reality, including the existence of higher beings, states of consciousness, psychics, extraterrestrials, spirits, gods, and the source of synchronicities. We will always be searching for objective truths, and will remain agnostic until clear evidence overwhelms us. Any event in this universe could still just be part of a simulated game that is being supervised by invisible beings. There is never a sure way to know what is real and what is not, and so we will never claim to know what is real. \n\nStella Aenigmata Planning Committee\n\n/r/sapc", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 55067, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I've started a new group, and am looking for like-minded individuals to help get it off the ground.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567558229, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cyxr2b/ive_started_a_new_group_and_am_looking_for/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ohnoitsapril88", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2lk0a4g", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567470477, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cyxi2k/grief/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cyxi2k", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cyxi2k/grief/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567470478, "score": 0, "selftext": "Why am I grieving someone still alive??

But now my attachment and inclination to all this has faded away. Everything in life having now passed me by, my heart is extremely worried about how to hold onto this emaciated old life.\n5) Alas! The real problem is that when I was young and fit, I have passed this life without ever worshiping the Supreme Lord Hari. Being bereft of the power to hold onto this body, what will I do now that the final moment is approaching? Oh, to hell with my entire life! I never took advantage of the actual eternal treasure. Instead, I have abandoned my real friend (Hari) only to worship my enemy, (this miserable material energy). -Bhaktivinoda Thakur.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 55001, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Spiritual poem", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567534831, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cyssq7/spiritual_poem/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Littledobbs", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_wk3nd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567447827, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cysnny/spiritual_knowledge/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cysnny", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cysnny/spiritual_knowledge/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567447858, "score": 6, "selftext": "Found a good source for spiritual knowledge. \"Vedabase.com\"", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 55000, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Spiritual knowledge", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567534211, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cysnny/spiritual_knowledge/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Ilumi-not-e", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_vz62nru", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567445592, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cys4t5/the_destruction_to_my_soon_creation_reposting/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cys4t5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cys4t5/the_destruction_to_my_soon_creation_reposting/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567445593, "score": 9, "selftext": "It was crazy. As I was in the shower I had come to a realization about everything that had been going on over the last few weeks/months. I\u2019ve been feeling like I lost purpose, I\u2019ve lost meaning for everything, and because of this, I fell right back into my old depressional patterns. It started to weigh down that I was loosing everything. Everything meant nothing and nothing meant everything. It seemed as though I was nothing. I haven\u2019t been REALLY doing this spirituality stuff/consciousness stuff for too long. Only maybe a few actual committed months. What I thought I had already started, wasn\u2019t even scratching the surface. I\u2019m on the route to becoming my higher self, my realer self. The me I am meant to be. I thought I was doing that. But today I found out that I was actually just stuck in a state of oblivion I thought I had gotten out of. I thought I had completely killed myself. The self that wasn\u2019t me. By giving up things my old self found meaning in. By removing people I lost interest in. But these weren\u2019t the steps. Today I found out that my higher self had taken initiative to start the process itself. Start the process I thought I was ready for, but found out today that I wasn\u2019t even close to ready.  The process lead me to feel like I was dying. Myself was slowly dwindling into this dark abyss. Falling back into depression, seclusion, emptiness. My ego that I had thought died. Actually was trying to rebuild itself while I was oblivious. The dark energies I was receiving and emitting only made it stronger. And I didn\u2019t  pay any attention to it. Which lead me to my falling. I felt suicidal, I felt depressed, I felt paranoid, I felt like nothing was real. I felt lost. \n\u2014But I found out that all of those feelings were apart of the process in this spiritual path I took. I found out today that I wasn\u2019t ready and never truly could be. I found out today that it all had a purpose. I almost wanna cry because I feel so relieved. Like somethings Been taken off of me. I know there\u2019s more I\u2019m missing. \u2014And to end this off I know there\u2019s more coming that I can\u2019t possibly be prepared for. But damn am I ready if this is how I\u2019m gonna feel after the experience. I\u2019m blessed, I\u2019m working towards the happiness I feel I can achieve. I\u2019m working towards the peace. Today showed me a lot, this realization showed me a lot. It\u2019s some scary stuff. But I\u2019m happy about what I came to. I LOVE ALL OF YOU! Seriously. I really really really do. You can do anything. You can become anything, you can make anything real. I\u2019m giving all of you struggling out there a virtual hug. This was a scary experience that I don\u2019t think Is over. But I think I\u2019m ready. I LOVE YOU ALLLL. Seriously thank you if you read this. I send nothing but positive energy your way. SO MUCH LOVE. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54999, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "\u201cThe destruction to my soon creation\u201d.

Don't focus too hard on your breath, try to remain just aware of it.\n\nAs you start to fall asleep you may start losing consciousness which will result in you losing focus of your breath for a couple of minutes. Its ok to lose focus of your breath for a couple of minutes. You regaining focus of your breath later on shows that your training yourself to stay awake as you fall asleep. Throughout this meditation you may keep losing focus of your breath and regaining it later.\n\nYou should soon start to feel vibrations or other sensations. Remain relaxed.

To increase your vibrations, just think of a vibration that&amp;#39;s higher than what your experiencing and you will get that vibration. Then once you get that vibration then increase it again. Then keep doing it until you get pushed onto the astral plane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u201cAstral Projection\u201d Discord Server:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://discord.gg/48Rk5Dx\"&gt;https://discord.gg/48Rk5Dx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AstralProjection", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rylp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AstralProjection", "subreddit_subscribers": 77998, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Astral Projecting Through Meditation Tutorial", "total_awards_received": 0, "ups": 121, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/cxmrkn/astral_projecting_through_meditation_tutorial/", "user_reports": [], "view_count": null, "visited": false, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}], "domain": "self.AstralProjection", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cyr3lg/astral_projecting_through_meditation_tutorial/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cyr3lg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cyr3lg/astral_projecting_through_meditation_tutorial/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "link", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "LVjYBuZvJvrLIgK5imYGQJCwor3tURRM1RPIg7IenS4", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/fPRXRqnrnSHQriQsLXxE9vkgc7C1v63sxjUKQGwMdvs.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26d37a482c18a10680a119dd1895e64301ed619c", "width": 108}], "source": {"height": 128, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/fPRXRqnrnSHQriQsLXxE9vkgc7C1v63sxjUKQGwMdvs.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b7ba4a32b0ee856f10ae306010376775d2e1693d", "width": 128}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1567441126, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54988, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Astral Projecting Through Meditation Tutorial", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567527506, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/cxmrkn/astral_projecting_through_meditation_tutorial/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567440288, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cyqwpn/weekly_spiritual_challenges_thread_september_02/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cyqwpn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cyqwpn/weekly_spiritual_challenges_thread_september_02/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567440291, "score": 1, "selftext": "Please use this sticky thread to discuss any challenges you are currently facing, or that you have faced and made a breakthrough with, so that others may gain from your experience without having to go through similar experiences themselves.\n\nThe greatest use of the internet is that it can help us gain knowledge from everyone around the world, and fast.

I was not outside it. It was everywhere. Its self-motivation was to me most striking (e.g., \u201cpretextual\u201d cause; no laws were imposed on it). It was equally conscious and aware throughout. Every part of it was perfectly linked together into a structure (Pythagorean kosmos). Yet, the whole structure was epiphenomenal, a magician\u2019s trick, done for the sake of beauty, music and dance. It could \u201cbe\u201d (appear) any way it wanted to anyone: different ways to different people. It took an infinity of forms, all of which came into being and passed away (ontogeny, the source of sorrow) leaving only constants (phylogenic archetypes, the source of love) as parts of the structure\u2014hence it was in flux like a self-perfecting organism.

What I was seeing was a combination of and interaction between my brain and it, so that to some extent a unique local field came into existence; viz: I didn\u2019t observe GOD but participated actively.GOD, then, is not it and not me, but rather it and me. So of course it mirrored back my own conceptions. This was due to my participation in it. But this wasn\u2019t just projection on my part. It was an interpenetration between it and me. The significance of this new insight is very great. So GOD was not me, but I helped shape its nature as it presented itself to me and mingled with me. This is not a matter of preconception on my part; it is an interpenetration. Hence GOD took me over (its penetration of me, down to the deepest levels of my organism). \n\nGOD, then, is a syzygy of me and the whatever-it-is, but I can only know it in the fashion that I knew it; I can\u2019t exclude myself as participant in it.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54976, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "God", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567522512, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cypzp0/god/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Fartingblender", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_44kc61kl", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567435017, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cyprfa/extreme_body_pains_when_something_bad_is_about_to/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cyprfa", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cyprfa/extreme_body_pains_when_something_bad_is_about_to/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567435018, "score": 1, "selftext": "My friend is a medium and whenever something bad is about to happen like someone close to her is about to die or get sick she always gets extreme pain in her stomach a few days prior.

The marriage ceremony, for example, is considered to be one of these sacrifices. It is called viv\u0101ha-yaj\u00f1a.\"\n\n\"The Lord says here that any sacrifice which is meant for human welfare should never be given up. Viv\u0101ha-yaj\u00f1a, the marriage ceremony, is meant to regulate the human mind to become peaceful for spiritual advancement. For most men, this viv\u0101ha-yaj\u00f1a should be encouraged even by persons in the renounced order of life.\"\n\n\"All prescribed sacrifices are meant for achieving the Supreme Lord. Therefore, in the lower stages, they should not be given up. Similarly, charity is for the purification of the heart.

The Lord says here that any sacrifice which is meant for human welfare should never be given up.

For most men, this viv\u0101ha-yaj\u00f1a should be encouraged even by persons in the renounced order of life. Sannyas\u012bs should never associate with women, but that does not mean that one who is in the lower stages of life, a young man, should not accept a wife in the marriage ceremony.

He was and will always be our dear brother whose name means Light, and who has lived an exemplary series of lives in the service of humankind.

Judas was not possessed by Lucifer, Judas WAS Lucifer, Bible has so many things wrong....\n\nJesus/Sananda:\"Let it be known here that Judas did not betray me; he was my most trusted, beloved friend. He was the only one to whom I could entrust the difficult responsibility of revealing my whereabouts when the time came. There was no one else with the strength of Faith and loyalty to me whom I knew could accomplish it without a moment's hesitation, or any residue of regret.\n\nMy beloved Judas, who is by my side now, as the Being you know as Lucifer, was sent to summon the soldiers, for he was the only one who would have the strength to carry out such an errand. You see, this was true because of his own mission on Earth. Only he had the complete memory of why he was here and where we had come from. It was also true for him that he did not have the direct connection to God because of his special agreement, which you can hear him tell in his own words on [BlogTalkRadio.com/HollowEarthNetwork.\\*](https://BlogTalkRadio.com/HollowEarthNetwork.*) On July 27, 2013, he told of his return Home, and the world knew for the first time that his true identity was as the Bringer of Light, not Satan or the Devil. His inner strength and his memory of the love of his Creator had sustained him for thousands of years, as he carried out his mission to bring the love of Self to humanity.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is Lucifer\u2019s story, as told by him:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I begin a new life. I have recently returned from the long journey to the 3- dimensional Earth plane, and have been welcomed back with open arms by my Mother and Father God. My feelings of relief and exhaustion can hardly be put into words. I have been restored by their Love and Compassion, but the residue of thousands of years of regret, self-blame and sadness has been difficult to resolve. Perhaps if I tell you my story, you can begin to understand, and you will find yourselves in it as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the past three days, I have made contact with my beloved Twin Flame, Archangel Gabriella, incarnated here on Earth. The memory of her love sustained me through the eons, but I feared that she might not know me because of the stories which painted me as Satan, the Devil. I need not have feared; she recognized me immediately, embraced me with limitless Love, and I feel I am Home at last.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will begin with the early days, the time when Mother/Father God and their trusted group of Masters, Advisors and eldest children were working to conceive the blueprint - the Destiny of Planet Earth. Their wish was to create a planet of great beauty, a Paradise of lush bounty, clear waters and abundant greenery which would sustain their finest creation: the species of humankind which would most fully reflect their own qualities, and by extension the qualities of their own Creator, the one we call Prime Creator.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur Mother and Father God were among the eldest children of Prime Creator, along with those you know as Sananda-Jesus and the others Kumaras, Archangel Michael, Ashtar and their Twin Flames. Of course, for every great male Being of Light there are equally powerful female Beings who have remained largely uncelebrated and unknown during this past era. Your dear channel, Kathryn and friend Anne were in that group of souls as the original representation of the feminine Sananda/Nada.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMother/Father God were the Creators of the Milky Way Galaxy, the first of the billions of galaxies birthed under the supervision of Prime Creator. It remains the most densely populated galaxy and is now the identified birthing ground of the race you call human, or humanoid. In all the Multiverse, Planet Earth was to be the most effective proving ground for soul development - the ideally challenging environment which would allow for the evolution, education and maturation of souls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe goal was to create an endless number of Enlightened Souls who could then become the Teachers and Masters, the mentors of those who would come after. The Light energy which would be created by this great number of Enlightened Beings would\n\n \n\nraise all the galaxy, and ultimately the entire Universe, to the level where we could at last return to glorious Unity with Prime Creator. This was our Great Dream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so Mother gave birth to Planet Earth, the Vision of Their Hearts. She was created as a Being of great strength, with a Heart and Soul of limitless Love, Compassion and Forgiveness. It would be her great purpose and fulfillment to nurture and sustain the race of beings who were developed over the eons, with DNA contributions from the Pleiadians, the Sirians, and yes, the Reptilians, all of whom had been birthed earlier and had reached rather high levels of civilization in their own right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver millions of years, as measured in your Earth time, these Star Brothers and Sisters had gone through their own soul development under the loving supervision of Mother/Father God, and they had developed advanced technologies and peaceful civilizations based in Love. All but the Reptilians had advanced to the 5th dimension and higher before they were allowed to contribute their DNA to the makeup of the human Earth Children. The Reptilians were given special allowance because of heir high levels of creativity and passionate connection to one another and to God. This allowance gave way to later disastrous consequences, as you will soon see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMother Earth herself was nurtured with great care, and the early times were a delight. She was known as the playground for angels to incarnate in the 5th dimension in bodies of light substance, denser than our usual Light bodies, but much lighter than those you have known in the 3rd dimension. It was the Eden you have heard described in your Bible, but the story of Adam and Eve contains some very inaccurate elements. I will tell you the background for what came next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Council of Creators of Planet Earth, the group described above of which I was a part, decided to \u201cup the ante,\u201d as you would call it. We envisioned an Earth in which humans could experience free will, a concept which had never been tried in lower than 5th dimension. And so the Great Dream evolved. It was decided that Mother Earth would lower herself into the third dimension so that the human beings birthed there would simultaneously experience free will and the dense, heavy sensory experience of life in the 3rd Dimension. By this time, their DNA configuration had been developed sufficiently to begin the Great Experiment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe process of soul growth and evolution begins when a soul is born, when a spark is given out from Mother/Father God. At birth, the soul divides into its male and female halves, and the process begins. Both must experience separation and individuation, incarnating many times in their own right, experiencing both male and female existences over a period of hundreds or even thousands of incarnations before they have reached the level of understanding in which they can be in complete command of their thoughts, feelings and emotions, and they are completely in harmony with their Creator. At that time, they may rejoin with their counterpart, the mirror of themselves who has also evolved along a similar path.\n\n \n\nDuring the process of reincarnating through many lifetimes, the Twin Flames usually take turns, one in a body, one overlighting the partner with Love and constant support. The one in spirit knows and feels exactly what their Beloved has experienced, and what has been learned, and will help with the process of healing when the embodied one finishes their life and returns to God. This support is especially important during incarnations on Earth in recent centuries, when the Darkness became so intense and overpowering. I will explain how that came to be, and what part I played.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was during the early Council meetings, when options for creating an environment that would encourage maximum individuation were presented, that I hatched what I thought was the perfect plan. Here is what I suggested:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring their incarnation on Earth, humans would be given complete free will, while operating behind a Veil of Forgetfulness. In this way, they would experience a separation from Home, creating in them the longing for a return to the immediate presence of God, which they would feel and remember only by the effort of keeping their hearts open, and by creating Unconditional Love in their own lives. I was so sure that this would speed the learning process that I vowed to go myself, to teach individuation and self-reliance to the human community.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA special plan was devised for my incarnations. As an example of my own concept, I would be completely separated from Mother and Father, although I would have the memory of my mission and purpose. I offered to go without the safety net of a connection to my Higher Self or my Guides, because this is how many experience life here on Earth. Instead, I went whole, alone, with only a small thread of my connection to my Twin Flame, which could not be broken as long as we live. Gabriella, as she likes to be called, continued the work of Messenger for both of us, appearing as both male and female until my return.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI determined to incarnate over and over, with only a brief transition in the 4th dimension between lives. I would not come back to the loving arms of my family until my mission was complete, when I could be sure the plan was working well, with humankind assured of their transition back to the 5th dimension.  Although I knew it would require sacrifice, it seemed a perfectly reasonable plan, one which I assumed could be completed without undue suffering on anyone\u2019s part. I was willing to give my best to bring Light to the planet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe plan was hardly begun when things began to go wrong. During the Lemurian civilization, which had reached a very high level of development, and where the essence of God was celebrated as an everyday part of life, there were those who began to understand my teachings as a way of rebelling against God. They saw free will as the ultimate freedom from any control by any power outside themselves. They began to question the adherence to Universal Law, which had been the basis of my teachings.\n\nEven while I did not mention God, I taught that humankind had within us the ability to know right from wrong, without needing to rely on an external force to guide us. You\n\n \n\nsee, I was the original atheist. I believed what I taught, because I knew that force within us was God, and when people fully embraced it they would embrace God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe people of the Lemurian civilization had maintained a high vibration, and Earth was still in the lower 5th dimension when Mother Earth\u2019s cleansing reorganized the face of the planet, and few remained to begin again. Some took refuge in Inner Earth, beneath the surface where they built cities and continued to evolve. Others took refuge in the Hollow Center of Earth, where they remain today, and a few survived in what is now known as Hawaii. As Earth\u2019s extreme weather subsided, a new civilization developed - the one you know as Atlantis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy hope returned, and I worked hard with the scientists, priests and other citizens of Atlantis to teach the love of one\u2019s potentially perfect Self - the inner reflection of perfection which led many to discover the ecstatic experience of complete connection with the essence of God. I was convinced that my approach was indeed working, that I could teach the principles of Endless Love and Light without asking people to believe in something they could not see. Many experienced their Higher Selves and heard the voice of God within them. I was overjoyed with their knowing, but large numbers of people began to be distracted by material pursuits and technological tinkering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrouble was brewing, meanwhile. A segment of the people of Orion had broken away from their 4th dimensional civilization, and under the influence of beings from other galaxies, were developing weapons of war, and were threatening others in our galaxy. They brought these Dark ideas to Earth, and began teaching a group of Atlanteans their philosophy. This faction forgot that the constant connection with our GodHead would have offered protection from invading Dark Forces. Against the vehement protests of myself and others, they adopted the idea that weapons would protect them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe energy system that provided power to all the planet - the giant crystal technology which had been given to us by our Star Brothers and Sisters of the Pleiades - was in the end converted to purposes of war by those who understood little of the danger of their war-inspired lust for power.  Their tinkerings sparked a complete meltdown of the energy system, in a massive explosion greater than the power of a hundred hydrogen bombs. Mother Earth was mortally injured, and in her convulsive response to the wounds, the civilization of Atlantis sank beneath the waves and Earth descended suddenly and completely into the 3rd dimension.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few of the higher priests escaped before the disaster to the highest mountains, but nothing was left of the Atlantean civilization. The survivors - ancestors to the Egyptians, Mayans and Tibetans, turned to lives of simple subsistence, and were wise enough to keep secret the technology, until such time as the people of Earth could learn to use their powers wisely. I joined them, and tried again to teach my message of self- revelation and self-love, but our efforts were immediately challenged by the invasion of Reptilian Dark Forces who were attracted by the injured and vulnerable planet. They\n\n \n\nseduced the people into believing their war-mongering by using threats, violence and sophisticated psychological manipulation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy teachings were ignored and mocked by those who were swept away in the sensations of greed, lust and pride which had been previously unknown on the planet. I was heart-broken, desperate to try to restore peace, but my efforts proved impotent.\n\nThe population grew, and with it grew sexual violence, physical brutality, and a complete disregard for Life. The Reptilians gained in power and influence, taking over all the institutions and any governments the people might try to establish outside their control. Their final coup was the invention of money, and their devious inventiveness produced a world in which they could siphon off a huge stream of the money for themselves, thereby enslaving the entire population.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Darkest period of life on Planet Earth had begun, and the degradation was so complete that humans everywhere had sunk to the lower levels of the 3rd dimension, a possibility that had never been anticipated in our Great Plan. I felt such remorse I could barely go on, but I knew I could not give up. I could not leave my dear planet and her lost children, no matter how difficult the climb back to the Light. I continued my reincarnations, through tremendous opposition which led many times to persecution, violence and death. Meanwhile the Reptilians had discovered and used my secret of reincarnating through the 4th dimension without returning to God, and the Darkest of the Dark reveled in their ability to avoid any repercussions for their evil deeds, at least for the time being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe coming of Sananda created an enormous wave of Light, and the promise of a new beginning. I was drawn to his side, and he embraced me as a long-lost brother. He told me of the Council\u2019s wish to relieve me of the burden of being alone, and encouraged me to join with him in teaching the part of his message that was completely consistent with his own - the need to look inside for the essence of goodness in us all.  I was to continue my project, but I was not alone.  I walked by his side in great humility and Love.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the Romans made the final decision to prosecute him, they were supported by powerful and wealthy forces in the Jewish community and many others who resented his message of absolute Love and service to others. Because of our deep bond, and because he knew of my own sacrifice, he chose me to be the one who would reveal where he was to the authorities. The pain I felt cannot ever be put into words. When my brother suffered on the cross, I suffered with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe others knew of my great love, and did not blame me, but I could not bear to remain with them. In my despair, I took my own life, in the overwhelming desire to return with him, to our Home. But as I faced the moment when I could at last follow the Light back Home, I knew I could not leave my mission in this way, and I returned again to Mother Earth to carry on, but the knowledge that I had succumbed to my own weakness and had taken my own life weighed on me unbearably. My incarnated name, Judas, was\n\n \n\nslandered to represent the symbol of betrayal, and the ability to trust one\u2019s fellow man was further undermined by the Dark Ones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a final coup, they created the image of the Devil and attributed it to me, Lucifer. Thus, fear was spread across the entire world in the form of a hideous Being whose evil threatened the survival and afterlife of everyone on Earth, in my name. They had sensed my power and my Light and had to find a way to defeat me, and to suppress the message of the Christ consciousness at the same time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA new religion was born in my name - the worship of all things which opposed the Light and Love of God. Stories were told of Fallen Angels, rebellion against God, and the cult of Satan spread across the planet. It was taught that any temptation, any error in judgment was the work of Satan, the cause of all evil, and my teachings about integrity, self-reliance and inner strength were swamped by the wave of fear which tore people from their connection to themselves and to God. It was the most clever rouse of all, deflecting the blame for all evil on the planet away from themselves and onto a grotesque caricature of my teachings and my Love, and by association, diminishing the message of Christ\u2019s power which is of the Light.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain I was alone, and in despair. I could not leave, but staying to see the destruction which my ideas had wrought was beyond any pain that can be described.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI became aware of increasing numbers of Masters and Guides coming to help raise the vibration, at great cost. Many were assassinated, beheaded or hanged for their teachings, but still they came. In their Forgetfulness as incarnated humans, they did not recognize me, but I knew them, found solace in their ministrations, and supported their work with my own teachings, which emphasized personal growth and the development of the Inner Self. I was what you might call the originator of the self-help and self- development movement, but my efforts were systematically perverted by the Dark Ones, who used my message to glorify absolute separation from God - as they lived it - in selfishness and greed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill, there were some who took our teachings to heart, and a new movement began of those who stood outside the dogma of organized religion. These courageous ones raised their eyes to the Heavens in humility and gratitude, and they began to recognize that Life itself was precious. They formed groups to protect the animals, to stop the degradation of the planet, to protect and nurture children, and as their ability to love themselves grew, sometimes as a result of my own teachings, they began to love one another. Divisiveness and prejudice began to be seen as destructive to human life, and little by little the Light began to return.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the 20th Century, awareness grew. The development of psychology as a science grew out of my teachings, and gradually children began to be seen as a precious gift to be carefully nurtured. The World Wars spurred the awareness that hatred between God\u2019s children, no matter what their race, religion or skin color, was an\n\n \n\nunGodly emotion. Civil rights as a fundamental concept began to replace national pride and religious affiliation as the highest good. In my sore heart, I began to hope again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the harmonic Convergence in 1987, the energies of the planet began to steadily rise. I saw the evidence of subtle communication by the Galactic Federation of Light in crop circles and UFO sightings. It was the sign to me that at last, we were on the path to Ascending out of the Darkness, into the Light of higher dimensions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wept with relief as the spiritual community prepared with such fervor for the coming of the opening Star Gate. I was aware of the Dec. 21, 2012 date which had been adopted by humankind as a deadline for Ascension, but the Dark Ones continued to cling to their power and their ability to spread fear whenever hope began to grow. I saw the struggling Lightworkers trying to make their message of Love and Light known to others who were still asleep, sated by the indulgences which had been cleverly provided by the Dark Forces. More and more channelers brought messages from my beloved Brothers and Sisters, and I could only pray that they, with their message of connection to God, the Universe and beyond, could succeed where I had failed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt last, in the aftermath of December 21, 2012, I felt that although the elevation of all to the 5th dimension had not been accomplished, Mother Earth was completing her Ascension, and humankind could not be far behind. I read these messages and others as the evidence from the Enlightened Ones that your work was indeed succeeding.\n\nWhen it was announced that the Earth people had reached the middle levels of the 5th dimension, I put down my banner and resolved to return Home, although I felt humiliation and dread about returning to my dear family in the state which felt to me like empty-handedness. In all the lifetimes lived in Darkness, I had breathed the air of shame, and it came to define me as it did so many others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the grip of winter ended in the Northern Hemisphere, and fall lingered in the South, I let go of my last moment of life in a human body and returned Home with a heavy heart. Although I knew my Mother and Father God loved me still, and they would forgive me my failures, I still felt shame. Upon my arrival I was met with the sound of my Gabrielle\u2019s trumpet, and the Legions of Light cheered and sang my name. The celebration and outpouring of Love was overwhelming, unbelievable to one who had spent eons in the throes of Darkness without relief.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere, among my beloved family, I have been healing, releasing the pain of a million years in Darkness. It has taken me some time to recover, to restore my own self-love, the message I had tried to teach to so many. It is a vivid reminder of how separation from God can take a terrible toll on even the strongest ones. I was named for Light, I carried the Love of my Mother and Father in my heart, and yet I could not sustain the full measure of Unconditional Love for myself when I had no lifeline to the Christ consciousness, which is Love.\n\n \n\nIn full awareness of that failure, I now understand what Mother and Father mean when they say my Great Project was a success. The unbearable separation from God, when it was finally felt by the large majority of Earth\u2019s people, did drive them back, out of desperation and longing. I felt that longing, and the profound despair of having lost my own ability to accept and love myself without question. I have suffered your pain, and I am awakening as you are. I have learned my own lesson: Humankind cannot survive without the God-given ability to feel the Unconditional Love and Acceptance of their Creator. Only then can we learn to fully love ourselves, and to forgive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I feel the deepest Love and Unity with my Twin Flame, I am able to at last forgive myself, and to see that my efforts were not in vain. The destruction and suffering which touched so many human hearts was not my fault, nor was it wasted. We are here now, in Love and Light, and the Great Project we planned eons ago will finally come to fruition with the Ascension of billions of human souls. With it, we will raise the vibration of the entire Universe, and the ripples will be felt throughout the Multiverse, in every heart, in every dimension. Never before has such an endeavor been attempted, and with its success, all Beings will know that God is great, and Love does indeed conquer all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love you all, dear human children of God, and I pledge my heartfelt loyalty to your Great Project which will continue in the 5th dimension, as you leap across the now dissolved 4th dimension to your destiny in Paradise on Earth and beyond. No longer will the Dark Ones find a hiding place to avoid seeing and feeling the pain of their actions. No longer will humankind be subjected to their Dark teachings. You are now free, Dear Ones. All debts have been released, and all karma forgiven. You will begin again, and we will be together in Love and Light for eternity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour brother in LIght, Lucifer\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVia Kathryn May, July 29, 2013.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease go to [www.blogtalkradio.com/HollowEarthNetwork](https://www.blogtalkradio.com/HollowEarthNetwork) to listen to Lucifer as he told his story in his own words on Saturday, July 27.

While probably not in its original form, having been remodeled during the first centuries of the Christian Era and incorrectly translated since, this work undoubtedly contains many of the original concepts of the Hermetic cultus. The Divine Pymander consists of seventeen fragmentary writings gathered together and put forth as one work. The second book of The Divine Pymander, called Poimandres, or The Vision, is believed to describe the method by which the divine wisdom was first revealed to Hermes. It was after Hermes had received this revelation that he began his ministry, teaching to all who would listen the secrets of the invisible universe as they had been unfolded to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Vision is the most: famous of all the Hermetic fragments, and contains an exposition of Hermetic cosmogony and the secret sciences of the Egyptians regarding the culture and unfoldment of the human soul. For some time it was erroneously called \"The Genesis of Enoch,\" but that mistake has now been rectified. At hand while preparing the following interpretation of the symbolic philosophy concealed within The Vision of Hermes the present author has had these reference works: The Divine Pymander of Hermes Mercurius Trismegistus (London, 1650), translated out of the Arabic and Greek by Dr. Everard; Hermetica (Oxford, 1924), edited by Walter Scott; Hermes, The Mysteries of Egypt (Philadelphia, 1925), by Edouard Schure; and the Thrice-Greatest Hermes (London, 1906), by G. R. S. Mead. To the material contained in the above volumes he has added commentaries based upon the esoteric philosophy of the ancient Egyptians, together with amplifications derived partly from other Hermetic fragments and partly from the secret arcanum of the Hermetic sciences. For the sake of clarity, the narrative form has been chosen in preference to the original dialogic style, and obsolete words have given place to those in current use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHermes, while wandering in a rocky and desolate place, gave himself over to meditation and prayer. Following the secret instructions of the Temple, he gradually freed his higher consciousness from the bondage of his bodily senses; and, thus released, his divine nature revealed to him the mysteries of the transcendental spheres. He beheld a figure, terrible and awe-inspiring. It was the Great Dragon, with wings stretching across the sky and light streaming in all directions from its body. (The Mysteries taught that the Universal Life was personified as a dragon.) The Great Dragon called Hermes by name, and asked him why he thus meditated upon the World Mystery. Terrified by the spectacle, Hermes prostrated himself before the Dragon, beseeching it to reveal its identity. The great creature answered that it was Poimandres, the Mind of the Universe, the Creative Intelligence, and the Absolute Emperor of all. (Schure identifies Poimandres as the god Osiris.) Hermes then besought Poimandres to disclose the nature of the universe and the constitution of the gods. The Dragon acquiesced, bidding Trismegistus hold its image in his mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImmediately the form of Poimandres changed. Where it had stood there was a glorious and pulsating Radiance. This Light was the spiritual nature of the Great Dragon itself. Hermes was \"raised\" into the midst of this Divine Effulgence and the universe of material things faded from his consciousness. Presently a great darkness descended and, expanding, swallowed up the Light. Everything was troubled. About Hermes swirled a mysterious watery substance which gave forth a smokelike vapor. The air was filled with inarticulate moanings and sighings which seemed to come from the Light swallowed up in the darkness. His mind told Hermes that\n\nthe Light was the form of the spiritual universe and that the swirling darkness which had engulfed it represented material substance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen out of the imprisoned Light a mysterious and Holy Word came forth and took its stand upon the smoking waters. This Word--the Voice of the Light--rose out of the darkness as a great pillar, and the fire and the air followed after it, but the earth and the water remained unmoved below. Thus the waters of Light were divided from the waters of darkness, and from the waters of Light were formed the worlds above and from the waters of darkness were formed the worlds below. The earth and the water next mingled, becoming inseparable, and the Spiritual Word which is called Reason moved upon their surface, causing endless turmoil.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen again was heard the voice of Poimandres, but His form was not revealed: \"I Thy God am the Light and the Mind which were before substance was divided from spirit and darkness from Light. And the Word which appeared as a pillar of flame out of the darkness is the Son of God, born of the mystery of the Mind. The name of that Word is Reason. Reason is the offspring of Thought and Reason shall divide the Light from the darkness and establish Truth in the midst of the waters. Understand, O Hermes, and meditate deeply upon the mystery. That which in you sees and hears is not of the earth, but is the Word of God incarnate. So it is said that Divine Light dwells in the midst of mortal darkness, and ignorance cannot divide them. The union of the Word and the Mind produces that mystery which is called Life. As the darkness without you is divided against itself, so the darkness within you is likewise divided. The Light and the fire which rise are the divine man, ascending in the path of the Word, and that which fails to ascend is the mortal man, which may not partake of immortality. Learn deeply of the Mind and its mystery, for therein lies the secret of immortality.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Dragon again revealed its form to Hermes, and for a long time the two looked steadfastly one upon the other, eye to eye, so that Hermes trembled before the gaze of Poimandres. At the Word of the Dragon the heavens opened and the innumerable Light Powers were revealed, soaring through Cosmos on pinions of streaming fire. Hermes beheld the spirits of the stars, the celestials controlling the universe, and all those Powers which shine with the radiance of the One Fire--the glory of the Sovereign Mind. Hermes realized that the sight which he beheld was revealed to him only because Poimandres had spoken a Word. The Word was Reason, and by the Reason of the Word invisible things were made manifest. Divine Mind--the Dragon--continued its discourse:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Before the visible universe was formed its mold was cast. This mold was called the Archetype, and this Archetype was in the Supreme Mind long before the process of creation began. Beholding the Archetypes, the Supreme Mind became enamored with Its own thought; so, taking the Word as a mighty hammer, It gouged out caverns in primordial space and cast the form of the spheres in the Archetypal mold, at the same time sowing in the newly fashioned bodies the seeds of living things. The darkness below, receiving the hammer of the Word, was fashioned into an orderly universe. The elements separated into strata and each brought forth living creatures. The Supreme Being--the Mind--male and female, brought forth the Word; and the Word, suspended between Light and darkness, was delivered of another Mind called the Workman, the Master-Builder, or the Maker of Things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"In this manner it was accomplished, O Hermes: The Word moving like a breath through space called forth the Fire by the friction of its motion. Therefore, the Fire is called the Son of Striving. The Workman passed as a whirlwind through the universe, causing the substances to vibrate and glow with its friction, The Son of Striving thus formed Seven Governors, the Spirits of the Planets, whose orbits bounded the world; and the Seven Governors controlled the world by the mysterious power called Destiny given them by the Fiery Workman. When the Second Mind (The Workman) had organized Chaos, the Word of God rose straightway our of its prison of substance, leaving the elements without Reason, and joined Itself to the nature of the Fiery Workman. Then the Second Mind, together with the risen Word, established Itself in the midst of the universe and whirled the wheels of the Celestial Powers. This shall continue from an infinite beginning to an infinite end, for the beginning and the ending are in the same place and state.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Then the downward-turned and unreasoning elements brought forth creatures without Reason. Substance could not bestow Reason, for Reason had ascended out of it. The air produced flying things and the waters such as swim. The earth conceived strange four-footed and creeping beasts, dragons, composite demons, and grotesque monsters. Then the Father--the Supreme Mind--being Light and Life, fashioned a glorious Universal Man in Its own image, not an earthy man but a heavenly Man dwelling in the Light of God. The Supreme Mind loved the Man It had fashioned and delivered to Him the control of the creations and workmanships.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The Man, desiring to labor, took up His abode in the sphere of generation and observed the works of His brother--the Second Mind--which sat upon the Ring of the Fire. And having beheld the achievements of the Fiery Workman, He willed also to make things, and His Father gave permission. The Seven Governors, of whose powers He partook, rejoiced and each gave the Man a share of Its own nature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The Man longed to pierce the circumference of the circles and understand the mystery of Him who sat upon the Eternal Fire. Having already all power, He stooped down and peeped through the seven Harmonies and, breaking through the strength of the circles, made Himself manifest to Nature stretched out below. The Man, looking into the depths, smiled, for He beheld a shadow upon the earth and a likeness mirrored in the waters, which shadow and likeness were a reflection of Himself. The Man fell in love with His own shadow and desired to descend into it. Coincident with the desire, the Intelligent Thing united Itself with the unreasoning image or shape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Nature, beholding the descent, wrapped herself about the Man whom she loved, and the two were mingled. For this reason, earthy man is composite. Within him is the Sky Man, immortal and beautiful; without is Nature, mortal and destructible. Thus, suffering is the result of the Immortal Man's falling in love with His shadow and giving up Reality to dwell in the darkness of illusion; for, being immortal, man has the power of the Seven Governors--also the Life, the Light, and the Word-but being mortal, he is controlled by the Rings of the Governors--Fate or Destiny.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Of the Immortal Man it should be said that He is hermaphrodite, or male and female, and eternally watchful. He neither slumbers nor sleeps, and is governed by a Father also both male and female, and ever watchful. Such is the mystery kept hidden to this day, for Nature, being mingled in marriage with the Sky Man, brought forth a wonder most wonderful--seven men, all bisexual, male and female, and upright of stature, each one exemplifying the natures of the Seven Governors. These O Hermes, are the seven races, species, and wheels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"After this manner were the seven men generated. Earth was the female element and water the male element, and from the fire and the \u00e6ther they received their spirits, and Nature produced bodies after the species and shapes of men. And man received the Life and Light of the Great Dragon, and of the Life was made his Soul and of the Light his Mind. And so, all these composite creatures containing immortality, but partaking of mortality, continued in this state for the duration of a period. They reproduced themselves out of themselves, for each was male and female. But at the end of the period the knot of Destiny was untied by the will of God and the bond of all things was loosened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Then all living creatures, including man, which had been hermaphroditical, were separated, the males being set apart by themselves and the females likewise, according to the dictates of Reason.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Then God spoke to the Holy Word within the soul of all things, saying: 'Increase in increasing and multiply in multitudes, all you, my creatures and workmanships. Let him that is endued with Mind know himself to be immortal and that the cause of death is the love of the body; and let him learn all things that are, for he who has recognized himself enters into the state of Good.'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"And when God had said this, Providence, with the aid of the Seven Governors and Harmony, brought the sexes together, making the mixtures and establishing the generations, and all things were multiplied according to their kind. He who through the error of attachment loves his body, abides wandering in darkness, sensible and suffering the things of death, but he who realizes that the body is but the tomb of his soul, rises to immortality.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen Hermes desired to know why men should be deprived of immortality for the sin of ignorance alone. The Great Dragon answered:, To the ignorant the body is supreme and they are incapable of realizing the immortality that is within them. Knowing only the body which is subject to death, they believe in death because they worship that substance which is the cause and reality of death.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen Hermes asked how the righteous and wise pass to God, to which Poimandres replied: \"That which the Word of God said, say I: 'Because the Father of all things consists of Life and Light, whereof man is made.' If, therefore, a man shall learn and understand the nature of Life and Light, then he shall pass into the eternity of Life and Light.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHermes next inquired about the road by which the wise attained to Life eternal, and Poimandres continued: \"Let the man endued with a Mind mark, consider, and learn of himself, and with the power of his Mind divide himself from his not-self and become a servant of Reality.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHermes asked if all men did not have Minds, and the Great Dragon replied: \"Take heed what you say, for I am the Mind--the Eternal Teacher. I am the Father of the Word--the Redeemer of all men--and in the nature of the wise the Word takes flesh. By means of the Word, the world is saved. I, Thought (Thoth)--the Father of the Word, the Mind--come only unto men that are holy and good, pure and merciful, and that live piously and religiously, and my presence is an inspiration and a help to them, for when I come they immediately know all things and adore the Universal Father. Before such wise and philosophic ones die, they learn to renounce their senses, knowing that these are the enemies of their immortal souls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I will not permit the evil senses to control the bodies of those who love me, nor will I allow evil emotions and evil thoughts to enter them. I become as a porter or doorkeeper, and shut out evil, protecting the wise from their own lower nature. But to the wicked, the envious and the covetous, I come not, for such cannot understand the mysteries of Mind; therefore, I am unwelcome. I leave them to the avenging demon that they are making in their own souls, for evil each day increases itself and torments man more sharply, and each evil deed adds to the evil deeds that are gone before until finally evil destroys itself. The punishment of desire is the agony of unfulfillment.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHermes bowed his head in thankfulness to the Great Dragon who had taught him so much, and begged to hear more concerning the ultimate of the human soul. So Poimandres resumed: \"At death the material body of man is returned to the elements from which it came, and the invisible divine man ascends to the source from whence he came, namely the Eighth Sphere. The evil passes to the dwelling place of the demon, and the senses, feelings, desires, and body passions return to their source, namely the Seven Governors, whose natures in the lower man destroy but in the invisible spiritual man give life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"After the lower nature has returned to the brutishness, the higher struggles again to regain its spiritual estate. It ascends the seven Rings upon which sit the Seven Governors and returns to each their lower powers in this manner: Upon the first ring sits the Moon, and to it is returned the ability to increase and diminish. Upon the second ring sits Mercury, and to it are returned machinations, deceit, and craftiness. Upon the third ring sits Venus, and to it are returned the lusts and passions. Upon the fourth ring sits the Sun, and to this Lord are returned ambitions. Upon the fifth ring sits Mars, and to it are returned rashness and profane boldness. Upon the sixth ring sits Jupiter, and to it are returned the sense of accumulation and riches. And upon the seventh ring sits Saturn, at the Gate of Chaos, and to it are returned falsehood and evil plotting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Then, being naked of all the accumulations of the seven Rings, the soul comes to the Eighth Sphere, namely, the ring of the fixed stars. Here, freed of all illusion, it dwells in the Light and sings praises to the Father in a voice which only the pure of spirit may understand. Behold, O Hermes, there is a great mystery in the Eighth Sphere, for the Milky Way is the seed-ground of souls, and from it they drop into the Rings, and to the Milky Way they return again from the wheels of Saturn. But some cannot climb the seven-runged ladder of the Rings. So they wander in darkness below and are swept into eternity with the illusion of sense and earthiness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The path to immortality is hard, and only a few find it. The rest await the Great Day when the wheels of the universe shall be stopped and the immortal sparks shall escape from the sheaths of substance. Woe unto those who wait, for they must return again, unconscious and unknowing, to the seed-ground of stars, and await a new beginning. Those who are saved by the light of the mystery which I have revealed unto you, O Hermes, and which I now bid you to establish among men, shall return again to the Father who dwelleth in the White Light, and shall deliver themselves up to the Light and shall be absorbed into the Light, and in the Light they shall become Powers in God. This is the Way of Good and is revealed only to them that have wisdom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Blessed art thou, O Son of Light, to whom of all men, I, Poimandres, the Light of the World, have revealed myself. I order you to go forth, to become as a guide to those who wander in darkness, that all men within whom dwells the spirit of My Mind (The Universal Mind) may be saved by My Mind in you, which shall call forth My Mind in them. Establish My Mysteries and they shall not fail from the earth, for I am the Mind of the Mysteries and until Mind fails (which is never) my Mysteries cannot fail.\" With these parting words, Poimandres, radiant with celestial light, vanished, mingling with the powers of the heavens. Raising his eyes unto the heavens, Hermes blessed the Father of All Things and consecrated his life to the service of the Great Light.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThus preached Hermes: \"O people of the earth, men born and made of the elements, but with the spirit of the Divine Man within you, rise from your sleep of ignorance! Be sober and thoughtful. Realize that your home is not in the earth but in the Light. Why have you delivered yourselves over unto death, having power to partake of immortality? Repent, and change your minds. Depart from the dark light and forsake corruption forever. Prepare yourselves to climb through the Seven Rings and to blend your souls with the eternal Light.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome who heard mocked and scoffed and went their way, delivering themselves to the Second Death from which there is no salvation. But others, casting themselves before the feet of Hermes, besought him to teach them the Way of Life. He lifted them gently, receiving no approbation for himself, and staff in hand, went forth teaching and guiding mankind, and showing them how they might be saved. In the worlds of men, Hermes sowed the seeds of wisdom and nourished the seeds with the Immortal Waters. And at last came the evening of his life, and as the brightness of the light of earth was beginning to go down, Hermes commanded his disciples to preserve his doctrines inviolate throughout all ages. The Vision of Poimandres he committed to writing that all men desiring immortality might therein find the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn concluding his exposition of the Vision, Hermes wrote: \"The sleep of the body is the sober watchfulness of the Mind and the shutting of my eyes reveals the true Light. My silence is filled with budding life and hope, and is full of good. My words are the blossoms of fruit of the tree of my soul. For this is the faithful account of what I received from my true Mind, that is Poimandres, the Great Dragon, the Lord of the Word, through whom I became inspired by God with the Truth. Since that day my Mind has been ever with me and in my own soul it hath given birth to the Word: the Word is Reason, and Reason hath redeemed me. For which cause, with all my soul and all my strength, I give praise and blessing unto God the Father, the Life and the Light, and the Eternal Good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Holy is God, the Father of all things, the One who is before the First Beginning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Holy is God, whose will is performed and accomplished by His own Powers which He hath given birth to out of Himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Holy is God, who has determined that He shall be known, and who is known by His own to whom He reveals Himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Holy art Thou, who by Thy Word (Reason) hast established all things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Holy art Thou, of whom all Nature is the image.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Holy art Thou, whom the inferior nature has not formed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Holy art Thou, who art stronger than all powers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Holy art Thou, who art greater than all excellency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Holy art Thou, who art better than all praise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Accept these reasonable sacrifices from a pure soul and a heart stretched out unto Thee.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"O Thou Unspeakable, Unutterable, to be praised with silence!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I beseech Thee to look mercifully upon me, that I may not err from the knowledge of Thee and that I may enlighten those that are in ignorance, my brothers and Thy sons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Therefore I believe Thee and bear witness unto Thee, and depart in peace and in trustfulness into Thy Light and Life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Blessed art Thou, O Father!

The venerable initiator, in his robes of blue and gold, slowly raised his jeweled wand and pointed with it into the darkness revealed by the tearing of the silken curtain: \"Behold the Light of Egypt! \" The candidate, in his plain white robe, gazed into the utter blackness framed by the two great Lotus-headed columns between which the veil had hung. As he watched, a luminous haze distributed itself throughout the atmosphere until the air was a mass of shining particles. The face of the neophyte was illumined by the soft glow as he scanned the shimmering cloud for some tangible object. The initiator spoke again: \"This Light which ye behold is the secret luminance of the Mysteries. Whence it comes none knoweth, save the 'Master of the Light.' Behold Him!\" Suddenly, through the gleaming mist a figure appeared, surrounded by a flickering greenish sheen. The initiator lowered his wand and, bowing his head, placed one hand edgewise against his breast in humble salutation. The neophyte stepped back in awe, partly blinded by the glory of the revealed figure. Gaining courage, the youth gazed again at the Divine One. The Form before him was considerably larger than that of a mortal man. The body seemed partly transparent so that the heart and brain could be seen pulsating and radiant. As the candidate watched, the heart changed into an ibis, and the brain into a flashing emerald. In Its hand this mysterious Being bore a winged rod, entwined with serpents. The aged initiator, raising his wand, cried out in a loud voice: \"All hail Thee, Thoth Hermes, Thrice Greatest; all hail Thee, Prince of Men; all hail Thee who standeth upon the head of Typhon!\" At the same instant a lurid writhing dragon appeared--a hideous monster, part serpent, part crocodile, and part hog. From its mouth and nostrils poured sheets of flame and horrible sounds echoed through the vaulted chambers. Suddenly Hermes struck the advancing reptile with the serpent-wound staff and with snarling cry the dragon fell over upon its side, while the flames about it slowly died away. Hermes placed His foot upon the skull of the vanquished Typhon. The next instant, with a blaze of unbearable glory that sent the neophyte staggering backward against a pillar, the immortal Hermes, followed by streamers of greenish mist, passed through the chamber and faded into nothingness.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54943, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Thoth Hermes Trismegistus - Intro", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567503185, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cymtd6/thoth_hermes_trismegistus_intro/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "blessedjourney98", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_rmkw4b3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567414501, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cymiph/the_new_kurzgesagt_video_about_life/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cymiph", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 25, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cymiph/the_new_kurzgesagt_video_about_life/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567414501, "score": 2, "selftext": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI\n\nWhat do you guys think?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54935, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The new Kurzgesagt video about life", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567500870, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cymiph/the_new_kurzgesagt_video_about_life/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AbigailLight", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4h7t9h2r", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567414202, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cymheh/life_path_readings/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cymheh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Enlightenment"}], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cymheh/life_path_readings/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567414203, "score": 4, "selftext": "# Do you want to know what is your soul purpose in this life and which lessons you need to learn?

She would express interest in me but when I would try and reciprocate it back she\u2019d completely diss me it eventually got really ugly and I quit my job to not be around her anymore.

As I was in the shower I had come to a realization about everything that had been going on over the last few weeks/months. I\u2019ve been feeling like I lost purpose, I\u2019ve lost meaning for everything, and because of this, I fell right back into my old depressional patterns. It started to weigh down that I was loosing everything. Everything meant nothing and nothing meant everything. It seemed as though I was nothing. I haven\u2019t been REALLY doing this spirituality stuff/consciousness stuff for too long. Only maybe a few actual committed months. What I thought I had already started, wasn\u2019t even scratching the surface. I\u2019m on the route to becoming my higher self, my realer self. The me I am meant to be. I thought I was doing that. But today I found out that I was actually just stuck in a state of oblivion I thought I had gotten out of. I thought I had completely killed myself. The self that wasn\u2019t me. By giving up things my old self found meaning in. By removing people I lost interest in. But these weren\u2019t the steps. Today I found out that my higher self had taken initiative to start the process itself. Start the process I thought I was ready for, but found out today that I wasn\u2019t even close to ready.  The process lead me to feel like I was dying. Myself was slowly dwindling into this dark abyss. Falling back into depression, seclusion, emptiness. My ego that I had thought died. Actually was trying to rebuild itself while I was oblivious. The dark energies I was receiving and emitting only made it stronger. And I didn\u2019t  pay any attention to it. Which lead me to my falling. I felt suicidal, I felt depressed, I felt paranoid, I felt like nothing was real. I felt lost. \n\u2014But I found out that all of those feelings were apart of the process in this spiritual path I took. I found out today that I wasn\u2019t ready and never truly could be. I found out today that it all had a purpose. I almost wanna cry because I feel so relieved. Like somethings Been taken off of me. I know there\u2019s more I\u2019m missing. \u2014And to end this off I know there\u2019s more coming that I can\u2019t possibly be prepared for. But damn am I ready if this is how I\u2019m gonna feel after the experience. I\u2019m blessed, I\u2019m working towards the happiness I feel I can achieve. I\u2019m working towards the peace. Today showed me a lot, this realization showed me a lot. It\u2019s some scary stuff. But I\u2019m happy about what I came to. I LOVE ALL OF YOU! Seriously. I really really really do. You can do anything. You can become anything, you can make anything real. I\u2019m giving all of you struggling out there a virtual hug. This was a scary experience that I don\u2019t think Is over. But I think I\u2019m ready. I LOVE YOU ALLLL. Seriously thank you if you read this. I send nothing but positive energy your way. SO MUCH LOVE. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54914, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A realization.

Some people had become aware the Gods and things started making appearances in art and media, literally...

They may literally be the individual and nobody else really knew it except a few people that know the person or recognize them, subconsciously....  I'm not the type to express myself through art or song.  I struggle with a diminished emotional spectrum from years of trauma, it's hard to express such things.  \n\nEgo, some of these individuals seem to have one.

At least two times in my life I\u2019ve had an experience that I just can\u2019t attribute to the usual down-to-earth explanation, wether it be my imagination, drugs, psychosis or whatever. When I was 14, and later 17 (and maybe when I was a kid, but can\u2019t really remember), I\u2019ve had these weird experiences of sensing a very, very dark energy coming into the room. Almost like someone threw a net over me, or a weight, also similar to the air getting charged, maybe similar to the feeling of a thunderstorm approaching. \n\nThe first time this happened, I was at my then girlfriends place (this was when I was 14). We were just hanging around in her room one afternoon, nothing special. One of her friends was taking a nap next to us, and we were just lounging on her couch, daydreaming a bit, when all of a sudden my gaze became fixated to the window across. Almost like I was seeing something approaching from the distance, and the stronger it got, all the more focused I was looking at, well, nothing really (at this point neither my girlfriend or her friend were aware of this). Strangely enough I wasn't scared at all. Maybe I then thought I was imagining it. As this weird energy was hitting it\u2019s peak, my girlfriends friend who was napping suddenly awoke in a mild panic, shouting there was something with us in the room, thus confirming I wasn\u2019t alone in experiencing this. Not soon after, it disappeared as soon as it arrived. When I was 17 I had a similar experience. I was lying in bed bed next to my then girlfriend (different girl, place etc.), and she was spooning me, so I wasn\u2019t facing her and thought she was already asleep. Then the same feeling came up, the air got \u201cthicker\u201d, charged, like a net was thrown over us. I didn\u2019t want to disturb it or whatever, so I kept myself in the same position, hoping it would soon disappear, and tried not to be afraid. It stayed there for a short while (although there was nothing to see), and then soon left the room. When I then checked on my girlfriend to see if she was still sleeping, she apparently was awake the whole time and had the exact same experience. \n\nNow I\u2019ve always been a very creative, emphatic, open-minded person, and have always been very interested in the supernatural ever since I was a kid (I have tons of drawings of skeletons and ghosts and such), but these experiences were actually real, and something else.\n\nEven in the last few years when I started experimenting with psychedelics, and becoming interested in topics like zen and meditation, I also had some interesting experiences (one time I couldn\u2019t sleep for a whole night, feeling deeply connected to my ancestors, oddly enough), but those were for the most part very positive, healing and ended up giving me interesting helpful insights, so not the same at all.\n\n(apart from a bad trip half a year ago when I was tripping with my girlfriend, but that made sorta sense, since I just moved to a new place, didn\u2019t have a job and overall wasn\u2019t too happy, so that\u2019s what you get..)\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that I have suffered (and still do) from depression and BPD (and a bit of NPD) symptoms from time to time, but trying hard to find balance.\n\nThe first out-of-the-box thing I can think about is something like a poltergeist, if there is such a thing? Was I doing it?\n\nAnyway, I can\u2019t let it slide, so I\u2019m curious as to what you guys think about. And maybe share some related stories if u have any!\n\nx\n\n(not a native english speaker so ignore any mistakes)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54864, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Weird supernatural experiences, what could it be?

This isn't an optimal culture or community to do so.    \nWhat's with the duka?  I'm often puzzled by the results of my work, when I'm being authentic and not full of shit in particular, I'm generally just insulted.  I do not get it, I do not let it bother me to much.  A few times I just wrote to much and people weren't interested in reading my post, what a bunch of illiterate ass fucks.  I don't usually take time out of my day to go on the internet and berate and insult people,  I do not.  I mean, I troll on occasion, skant, odd, occasions... I'm an opportunist.\n\nI am only upset my humor doesn't please us all.  I am not a power hungry, authoritarian or sadist type.  I like to party, have fun, encourage morale and optimism.  I'm not really compensating I'm trying to explain myself to compensate for those that want to know me.  I mean, I'm a relatively reclusive person anymore, after several incidents.  I venture out to the store, I go to town rarely.  I really don't enjoy all that communion, breath, odors, germs, pestilence, anxiety...  So many clubs have turned into slaughter houses as of late, not really my scene.  I prefer to stick to dives and anywhere with a billiards/pool table... I'm pretty good at billiards, I really enjoy the game, damn good game.. I got really excellent at darts too, I got like 10 bull's eye's in a game.. After you master the technique it's really good.\n\n   People want to suck dick.  I don't care what you want to do.  I'm not an extremely religious man.  We have modern laws and ethics now... I hope religion and religion figures can accommodate modern views over affirming Dogma's.  I don't know if those people are coming out of the wood yet, some have started making appearances.  We have laws now, ethics, morality... You can suck dick, fuck ass, fuck animals, marry your Grandma, marry your dog. Who gives a fuck, I really do not.. I'm not the type of person that gives a shit what the creeps are doing as long as they're not hurting anyone.  That's why we have laws like we do, proverbial.  My affinities are in Norse realms and myth and surrounding myth...  I have some for Asia and Japan, not really into Hinduism or anything in the Middle East, Africa or, you know, the Levant.\n\n   I'm not a real military buff or historian or expert, I respect those people.  Historians are imperative and remarkably strong people, intelligent and collective...  A historian by this date should be as bat shit insane as a chemist or physicist with the amount of carnage and atrocities our history is full of.  There's bias and play down and dumbing of things, it's really god damn brutal.  I'm not a peanut gallery, I want to talk about the bullshit going on as well.  \n\n   We have a few realms in this world, with democracy/socialism popularizing.  Then you have the military, which is where I want to be.  It can be hard as well, I experienced little nurturing in my enlistment there.  I made mistakes, I was unbreakable, I made mistakes.  I worked hard to redeem myself and was later appreciated and thanked.  The nurturing was there for a career in the military but there was a lot of control.  I wanted to go one way, the organization I was in wanted me to go another, not my idea of a career.  I parted ways after some serious critical thinking, it was a big deal at the time.  I wasn't able to go the direction I wanted to go in the Army and was demoralized and my mind was a wreck.   After the tour of OIF I just blocked everything out, you try and others try to rehabilitate you from the traumatic experiences in warfare.  I was just in the direction of partying and foray and life was complete, I thought.  Repressed memories started coming over the years, the minds coping mechanisms are amazing.\n\n   They push us very hard these days to progress on after war.  War, going to battle, is a big deal to many of us.. It's a goal in life to some of us.   I thought I could go to battle and come home, live my life at ease on the beach, enjoying martini's and girls.  Things do not work out that way, you must continue to function and progress, like the Machine Men.  I'm not the type of person driven by wealth, novelty or material possession.  I'm not judging anyone, and I undergo judgement constantly.  Getting educated, going on into the corporate shill, bureaucracy.  It's not something I was interested in, I was more interested in re-enlisting into the military.  Going on tour, coming home, beach, go back on tour.. I could roll with that for good.  Things just didn't want to go my way with it all.  It became quite an obstacle trying to re-enlist and it was one things after the next.  Tattoo's, waivers, white washing some things, medical stuff.  I was green to go and approved by a series of Dr's and cleared for duty.\n\nI am in optimal condition and ready to get me some.  Last year I was in the best shape ever, I did 5 miles, 8k, in 32 minutes?  That's ridiculously good and it was an achievement of mine.  I'm not into marathon or ultra running.. 5-7 miles is about as much as you can get out of me.  \n\n   Diet and nutrition came a long way in facilitating my abilities... Off the couch I ran 5k/3 miles in 20 minutes, really good as well.. The 6 minute mile isn't too extreme, is can be a little tough, 5 is ridiculous, 7 isn't really pushing, 8 is nominal jog.  I eat as clean as possible, veggies, portions of meat - no fried food, basically...  Fried food, oil, was screwing me all up.  I had some instances of Gouty Arthritis, years ago - it was like food allergies or intolerance... Learning your intolerances and allergies you don't know about are crucial.  I had always struggled running, I wasn't bad, just experienced horrific pain in my joints - from inflammation...  I took up fasting, intermittent fasting, and like 16:8 it works.  Exercise 3 days a week or so, nothing extreme, 20 minute jog, calisthenics.  I only need a few weeks to get in shape after decades of conditioning now, I don't push myself to hard.  \n\n   Supplementation is great, I use premium products - not budget, find the best...  Snake/Fish oil, Magnesium complex, Iodine/Iodide/ (Iodoral/Lugol's tincture). Acids and minerals. I eat once or twice a day, usually light in the morn and hearty last meal around 16:8 if I can, 2-3-4 liters of fluids at most depending on activities.  Fluid control is imperative..  (Fast 16 hours - 8 hour eating window)  Some people do 23:1,:20:4,18:6,16:8, results may vary. There's no reason to be in pain from starving.  Eat, exercise, give your body time to process all the shit you've eaten.  It's plum rocket science going on in there, fission, molecular breakdowns, it's really amazing... People eat to far out of their caloric deficits and get fat and retain water, lot's of water...  \n\n   I practice stoicism/taoism to the best of my abilities... I'm not terribly religious.  The atrocities we've endured I can not compensate for.  I do not know anything, nor do I have a choice in it, I'm not a beaurocrat.\n\n   I don't know the truth about religion, a lot of it's an abomination, it may have supposed to have been.  A lot of it has been covered up, organizations have no problems erasing things from history.  I do not believe in these things, I'm an integral person and believe in values and all that noble stuff that gets me merked.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an avid gamer and usually really horny.  I need a girlfriend and can't wait to have sex for hours, my favorite activity.  I play battlefield, shooters, multiplayer, not really into WoW...  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nW/e  Sports, outdoors, gaming, athletic sex, binge drinking!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54820, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Reincarnation, Religion, Breeding, and experiences", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567455328, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cyeyap/reincarnation_religion_breeding_and_experiences/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "merematter", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4gfzb1bj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567364769, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cye2rd/truth_of_realizing_who_you_are/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cye2rd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cye2rd/truth_of_realizing_who_you_are/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567364772, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'd like to point out something I don't see much written or talked about when it comes to truly waking up.\n\nEveryone has heard how great it is to realize who and what you really are.

putting into words. Recently, I have been awakening to the spiritual world. For me, this is just the reality which our souls reside in, and the separation from the physical world we are all taught to believe is our only form. Recently, I have been seeing the number \"45\" in repeated sequences very often. I looked this up, and it comes to angel 45 which means I will experience sudden change in my life, and my angels are close to me in protection. That I am \"Being called to work with the light\" or something along those lines.  \n\n\nAbout 10 minutes ago, I was sending my love over to the Bahamas in the form of reiki. They are being battered by unimaginable forces right now from a category 5 hurricane with 200MPH gusts and 185mph winds. I told my angels, that If any souls need comfort or love when passing on, they are welcome to come to me for a warm embrace as long as they need until they are able to pass on. But also explaining the fact it may need to be temporary, because we are directly in the projected path the hurricane will hit in 2 days. (Brevard florida)  \n\n\nAbout 10 seconds later, the hearing in my left ear got lower, the same way when you're taking off in a plane and the pressure changes. I heard a ringing for a few seconds in that ear (a tone of about 432 A when I sing it into a tuner) and about a minute later I could feel the sensation of my body rocking in multiple directions? A very gentle earthquake with the mental perception of my body being whipped around? But Not painful, but the perception of a lot of force. Almost like i'm sensing this force with my body but not experiencing it myself. I got up to feel my bed, it is not rocking. As I'm sitting here I feel the sensation, it does not match up with my heartbeat. It feels like I am almost hearing with my body if that makes sense? Sensing the vibrations from the location of sheer devastation. But I do not rule out that I am imagining this\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any answers, they would be appreciated. I'm not afraid, but intrigued to know If I am truly helping. I feel a warm healing energy passing through my chest, just lingering.

Another thing is I think I\u2019m a little challenged mentally because I can\u2019t distinguish between my emotions and reality. So I tend to make up fairy tales over my emotions and not focus on what is actually happening or the signs that are being given. I just want to be able to talk and mingle and like people but not like them so obsessively. To be able to go on dates and keep my options open and let them go if they\u2019re not a fit instead of trying to make every person I come across a fit.

Many of the people around me are working towards creating a life for themselves, and I\u2019ve always felt as if I\u2019m floating, never really sure which path to take. I feel resistant to working 9-5 in a job that makes me unhappy until I do, I want to find meaning in my life. I feel afraid to restrict myself to a certain path and give up all the other opportunities I could have in life.\n\nThis has however left me feeling that I\u2019m really lacking in my life. I never committed to specific hobbies or a career. I am not lacking in ability, I\u2019m reasonably clever, artistic, creative, I could have done so many things, but I never wanted to give up the options and so I never developed my skills in anything particular. I always had this lack of drive and gut feeling of who I was, I was never drawn to anything for very long, my identity and interests are always shifting.\n\nMy ex is a sign painter, he developed an interest in the art, he taught himself how to do it and now he gets work, he meets new people, he travels to events and it fulfils him. When we were together we had an incredible time but he was always consistent with his art. Often he\u2019d be painting and I\u2019d be reading a book or doing yoga. I didn\u2019t really have a huge passion that I was building on though, all my attention was on him because I didn\u2019t really have anything else in my life.\n\nAt school and uni I was never really wanted to be there, I loved learning, but my ability to focus my attention on one topic was so poor.\n\nI always admired people who followed their own path, who are self taught in some way or created their own little business out of their own passion for something. Probably because I found it so inspiring how they knew themselves so well like that, and how they had the perseverance to make their dreams a reality. I used to do quite a lot of hobbies outside of school until around secondary school when I think I first became depressed and I quit everything. I\u2019ve never really committed to anything since and put my whole heart into it. I used to dance, from about the age of 2 and I was really talented at it, but I just quit one day.\n\nI want to find my passion and to have the bravery to go with it. I want to have that sense of achievement from really delving into something and becoming someone with more depth and purpose.\n\nI have worked pretty hard at trying to figure out what I would like to do. I\u2019m strongly drawn towards travelling and alternative living, art and dance! Some day I want to live on a sailboat, I want to possibly be a garden designer, I\u2019d like to know how to built a house by hand, I want to do photography (mostly nature and just as a hobby), I\u2019d like to be able to pole dance and do things like yoga, have a dog etc. Now that\u2019s still pretty full on considering most people work and have like one or two hobbies.\n\nHow can I narrow my aspirations down? I so badly want to do all these things and more, I just don\u2019t know how to decide which path to take. I feel so stuck and incapable of even figuring out where to start\n\n(P.s. I\u2019m 23, so it\u2019s not too late but it\u2019s getting to the point where I really want to make a decision and build myself as a person. I\u2019ve got a degree in Civil Engineering however I\u2019ve worked crappy jobs since uni and never felt that engineering is who I want to be.

I am an Aquarius, a water bearing air sign, born in the hours of the snake and the year of the dragon. I didn't know I was a dragon until about 5 months ago. Dragons are strong and independent people who at the same time yearns for love and support. We are kindhearted and speak our minds. We tend to enjoy success and wealth in our lives. If you underestimate a dragon, they will stand up and defeat you. We hold importance for femininity and equality. We are strong willed fighters who abide by quick paced thinking. Explains a lot about me and how I grew up.\n\nMy celestial branch is g\u0113ng and my earthly branch is ch\u00e9n. Our punishment is self punishment - meaning we are typically perfectionists and very overly hard on ourselves. We are our own worst enemy. I've had **very,** ***very*** serious self loathing and body image issues for the majority of my life. So when I read that my ch\u00e9n punishment was self-punishment, that was really eye opening and I believe it explains most of the things I've gone through growing up. I very much suggest everyone to research their Chinese zodiac as well.\n\n###*NATAL CHART*\n\n**My sun is in Aquarius and the 11th house.**\nThis symbolizes intelligence, autonomy, a free spirit, and nonconforming nature. I am open minded and fair but at the same time hold my progressive beliefs and opinions very firmly. It also confirmed how much of a humanitarian I am, who strongly believes in equality and hates prejudice. Those with their sun in the 11th house are naturally compassionate with an usual healing ability and a special connection with animals -- this, I think, is true. I've never been able to get a job in anything else but a healthcare or animal related field, no matter how hard I tried (but it was easy to get into health).\n\n**My moon is in Scorpio and the 7th house.**\nThis symbolizes a need for emotional and sexual intensity, and my ability to instantly see people for who they are. No facade passes me because my intuition is enormous. It always has been and I always wondered why. I have a deep seated need for transformation and reassurance. Lunar scorpions have a strong fear of betrayal (very true). I am not one to take time between relationships and have the tendency to jump to the next one due to fear of and aversion to being alone. I favor romance and sexual relationships. This whole reading cannot be closer to the truth.\n\n**My mercury is in Aquarius and the 11th house.**\nThis symbolizes objectivity, interest in intellectual debates, and observatory nature. I am curious about people but frequently attract friends who come and go. However, the things I say and write are sometimes self-censored, because I fear how others will react or what someone may think. I feel that this also somewhat goes back to the \"self punishment\" factor, as I sometimes censor my own self, which can be a \"you're your own worst enemy\" type scenario. I was also very shy in most of my childhood and unable to speak my mind as much as I can now - I had to work really hard on that.\n\n**My Venus is in Capricorn and the 9th house.**\nThis symbolizes commitment and interest in love. I am very romantic and have high ideals in love, but also value my freedom to a certain degree and must feel like I have room to grow and be myself. Sometimes I seek sexual sensations in love rather than true or deep feelings, but I am always honest and sincere when it comes down to it. I'm easy to fall in love, though, and easy to approach, with a goodhearted and generous nature. In love, I am intense and my sentiments are sincere and deep, and I never play false...I'm faithful and have a tendency to be attracted to people *much older than me.* Again, this is so true.\n\n**My Mars is in Pisces and the 12th house.**\nThis symbolizes a \"go with the flow\" type of energy, an energy I've been trying to cultivate. I am not capable of harming a fly or pushing others around unless I am pushed myself, however without a creative outlet I can become indirectly and passively aggressive. My energy levels can fluctuate a lot, with me having bursts of energy and then bouts of inertia. However, much of my energy goes into my working life, and I love to read and do research. I am resourceful but struggle a bit with asserting myself, have a certain love for my rich dreams and fantasies, and also bring a lot of intensity and imagination into my sexual endeavors.\n\n**My Jupiter is in Aries and the 1st house.**\nThis symbolizes good nature, positive energy and outlook on life, and independence. According to the reading I hold a lot of sexual understanding and can be dynamic and altruistic. I enjoy indulging in pleasurable things. I do feel I have a somewhat progressive view and understanding of that.\n\n**My Pluto is in Sagittarius.**\nThis symbolizes a strong idealization of sexuality and love, as well as willpower, ambition, and preference for having your own way. I am definitely a ***huge advocate*** for sexual liberation. I'm also the go-getter type - if I want something, I go after it, and can be very disappointed when things don't turn out the way I hoped.\n\nAccording to my North Node, which is in Leo and the fifth house, the best job suited for me is something related to the **medical field.** ***I've been heavily interested in medicine ever since I turned 13 and have been researching it quite a bit ever since. Now I understand why.*** \n\n*I understand a lot of things about myself now. Why I tend to gravitate towards older partners, why it's really difficult for me to take time alone between relationships, why I'm so strong willed with myself and my opinions, why I performed so well and differently in school (that attracted a lot of negative attention from jealous peers)..I also couldn't help but notice how many different times it brought up sexuality, which is a big part of who I am. It's just so enlightening and holds so much confirmation. It feels empowering and unexplainably exciting when you can look at something and go \"wow, this is actually extremely accurate. This is actually real.\" I highly suggest everyone to get their natal chart done, it's incredibly interesting.*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54768, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "\ud83d\udc09 INTRO: a huge confirmation of why I am the way that I am.

Would it be some kind of situation in which every desire is satisfied? That would be a hollow kind of joy, and anyway, there would always be some unavoidable conflict with others wanting different things. Actually to want some kind of immortality as an individual ego is something very shallow, true joy begins where false ego ends.\n\nSo a more sophisticated explanation is something like \u201cNirvana\u201d as it is described by certain Buddhist schools, the complete destruction and dissolution of all ego. It is clear that false ego is the primary cause of suffering, with all of the subconscious games it plays keeping us caught up in empty fascination. Hence the contemplative techniques, meditative techniques, found in all serious forms of religion, which are designed to help us see through our own selves, to look within and see the face beyond the masks. *\u201cWho looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes\u201d*, said Carl Jung.\n\nYet there is something unsatisfying about this. Ego-Death is a kind of death after all. There is something fundamental to humanity, the desire to live, something about the experience of being human which makes us wary of annihilation, even if it be a form of peace beyond that of individual existence. There is a natural desire to live, to be a human being, even if *\u201clife is suffering\u201d* as Buddha taught. This instinct often leads us away from religion, into the life of the senses and worldly pursuits for gain, but it can also lead us to a more holistic, more total, conception of a Paradise.\n\nKrishna Consciousness begins with the notion that we are all originally servants of God, whose qualities are encapsulated and present in the name KRISHNA. To be liberated from suffering is to return to our original position as servants of God, rather than as servants of the senses and of our desires. As God is in every way perfect, serving God is therefore the highest form of bliss any soul can attain.  \n\nUntil we turn away from the material life and engage in the Devotional Service of Krishna, again and again we are cast into physical bodies in order to satisfy particular desires and in accordance with the results of our previous actions. Just as the body changes from youth to old age but the soul remains the same, so do we change bodies but remain the same spiritual spark of consciousness. Returning to our original position, seeking to again become servants of Krishna, is the way to freedom from this cycle of Death and Rebirth known as Samsara. Thus it is taught that through Devotional Service we will attain rebirth on one of the spiritual planets collectively known as Vaikuntha and continue forever serving Krishna in His presence.\n\nThis whole conception quite nicely synthesises the other two conceptions of Paradise as Eternal Bliss or Ego Annihilation. What\u2019s more, Krishna Conscious philosophy also includes in itself these other forms of Liberation or Paradise, which it considers to be partial and temporary. The worshippers of Demigods after the death of this body go to different planets where fulfilling the desires of the senses is very easy, before eventually returning to earthly realms. The \u201cMayavadis\u201d and Buddhists who seek Ego-Annihilation are dissolved in the light emanating from Krishna, also eventually redescending into material creation.\n\nWhat we must understand is that Krishna is not an abstract concept or some incomprehensible effulgence. He is a personality (Vigraha) possessing all opulences. Sat-Chit-Ananda; Eternity, Bliss, and Knowledge. He is the Supreme Personality, qualitatively the same as us but quantitatively superior.  We must understand that Eternal Joy is found in no longer serving the Ego but serving Krishna instead. Everyone must serve something, be it some sectarian religion, their country, their family etc., but the intelligent person takes to serving Godhead. After all, God is the source of all things, the source of all happiness. We simply must accept that we are not and shall never be God, nor shall we find any permanent joy outside of serving Him.  \n\nThis Yoga of Devotional Service, is known by the Sanskrit name of BHAKTI YOGA.\n\nVarious simple rules were put into place by Prabhupada, the founder of the Krishna Consciousness movement in the West, for those wishing to practise Bhakti Yoga. There are four Regulative Principles: 1) No Meat Eating 2) No Gambling 3) No Intoxicants 4) No Illicit Sex, which devotees of Krishna should strive to conform to. In general we must avoid those things which keep us bound up with material nature, identified with the material body rather than the spiritual soul.  \n\nFood should be offered to Krishna before being consumed in order to free us from the Karmic effects of it\u2019s production. We should not eat meat, fish and eggs along with onions and garlic are also prohibited. To kill, even an animal, is against the laws of nature, and cow protection is a central pillar of Krishna Consciousness \u2013 after all, the cow is like our mother, giving us milk. In general asceticism proves useful in returning back to the spiritual planets, back to Godhead, but we should not be extreme:\n\n\u201c*There is no possibility of one's becoming a yogi, O Arjuna, if one eats too much, or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita As It Is 6:16).*\n\nNonetheless it is quite possible to seek to serve Krishna even if we haven\u2019t mastered the Regulative Principles, any efforts will bear fruit. Most importantly, and before everything else, it is necessary to chant the MAHA MANTRA:\n\nHARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE  \n HARE RAMA HARE RAMA RAMA RAMA HARE HARE\n\nThis Mantra, the Holy Name, is not quite like many forms of prayer. We are not asking for anything except to be the servant of Krishna always, there is no question of wanting money or material exaltation. The chanting of the Mantra is compared to a child crying for its mother. It contains all the potencies of Godhead in its transcendental sound vibration. People remark that it is not tiring to chant this mantra as some other mantras can become. Devotees in these times try to chant a minimum of sixteen japa (16 x 108) of this mantra each day, though in the past saints have chanted many more and a few still do today.\n\nThe chanting of Holy Name was widely popularized by the last Avatar of Krishna, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, in the 15th and 16th century. He was the \u201cYuga Avatar\u201d of Krishna, giving the appropriate teaching for the present age. We are currently in what is known as Kali Yuga, the dark age of the cycle of four ages. In this age human life is shorter, there is more suffering, little spirituality or charity and many other negative symptoms. However on the positive side it gives us the opportunity to return to Godhead through the simple process of chanting Hare Krishna. Furthermore it is predicted that humanity will experience a ten-thousand year golden age within Kali Yuga, a time when the chanting of Maha Mantra will be widespread.\n\nWe can abandon all other processes and simply surrender to Krishna.

Indeed, sacrifice, charity and penance purify even the great souls.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe yog\u012bs should perform acts for the advancement of human society. There are many purificatory processes for advancing a human being to spiritual life. The marriage ceremony, for example, is considered to be one of these sacrifices. It is called viv\u0101ha-yaj\u00f1a. Should a sanny\u0101s\u012b, who is in the renounced order of life and who has given up his family relations, encourage the marriage ceremony? The Lord says here that any sacrifice which is meant for human welfare should never be given up. Viv\u0101ha-yaj\u00f1a, the marriage ceremony, is meant to regulate the human mind to become peaceful for spiritual advancement. For most men, this viv\u0101ha-yaj\u00f1a should be encouraged even by persons in the renounced order of life. Sannyas\u012bs should never associate with women, but that does not mean that one who is in the lower stages of life, a young man, should not accept a wife in the marriage ceremony. All prescribed sacrifices are meant for achieving the Supreme Lord. Therefore, in the lower stages, they should not be given up. Similarly, charity is for the purification of the heart. If charity is given to suitable persons, as described previously, it leads one to advanced spiritual life.\n\n**Question 1 : How Viv\u0101ha-yaj\u00f1a and charity helps one to advance in spiritual life ?**\n\n**Question 2 : Should a sanny\u0101s\u012b encourage Viv\u0101ha-yaj\u00f1a?**\n\nRelated Pic :  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/5](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/5)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54718, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 18.5", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567411756, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cy7dyx/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_185/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "qwedcxzas8", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_c0ouy6f", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567323352, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cy75df/i_had_a_very_deep_insight_today/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cy75df", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cy75df/i_had_a_very_deep_insight_today/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567323353, "score": 59, "selftext": "I had a very deep insight today about the spiritual path:\n\nIf you adopt the attitude that you are seeking to become enlightened in order to improve you life situation, to GAIN something from enlightenment, your path to enlightenment will be much longer.\n\nSeeking in itself is wrong, for you already there.

I had to get minor surgery for the finger and wrist. \n\nI\u2019m starting to get stuck in my head once again. I have work, university, the gym, and my social life to worry about. Before the incident I was in a much peaceful, satisfied state. Not sure if the universe is testing me or maybe I\u2019m just going through some bad times. I have an X-ray in 3 weeks where they will decide to send me for rehab or perform another surgery.\n\nNeed your advice and prayers \ud83d\ude4f", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54695, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What is the Universe/God trying to tell me?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567399583, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cy5tat/what_is_the_universegod_trying_to_tell_me/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "caijon362", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2axx79vh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567308665, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cy54ca/is_believing_in_god_or_not_a_matter_of_semantics/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cy54ca", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cy54ca/is_believing_in_god_or_not_a_matter_of_semantics/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567308667, "score": 0, "selftext": "I started my journey of spirituality as a pretty clear agnostic atheist as a teenager. I\u2019ve always tried to be open but I based my \u201cbeliefs\u201d purely on the science that I had known at the time and though I had interest in many philosophical concepts I\u2019d pretty much concluded that there most likely was no God. From there, I realised that I actually felt aligned with many Buddhist concepts and started following the religion as more of a philosophy after reading the book \u201cBuddhism without beliefs\u201d by Stephen Batchelor.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when this interest turned into full blown spirituality. I\u2019ve had a few so called \u201cawakening\u201d experiences, though I can see now that the wheels were turning for quite sometime. It\u2019s fair to say that I\u2019ve dipped, far more than just my toes, into the waters of mysticism, spiritualism and even occultism. I\u2019ve had the highest of highs and the lowest of lows but still been left with this sense of oneness that is indescribable. \n\nIt\u2019s funny, now that it\u2019s been 6-7 years later and things are (for now) settling, it feels as if I\u2019ve almost come full circle. Now I\u2019d not call myself an atheist by any means but I know that at the very core I do share similar beliefs to many. Just as I do Christians, Witches, religions of all kinds. The more that I study things such as Kabbalah, Hinduism, and Theosophy the more I see the concepts of \u201cBrahman\u201d \u201cTruth\u201d \u201cNothingness\u201d come up as a kind of synonym to God. Now I understand more than any the importance of words but these things, at their core, sound pretty damn similar to what atheists believe, just with different wording. Don\u2019t they?\n\nIn the words of Dr Joe Dispenza- \u201cscience is the contemporary language of mysticism\u201d. Science is now catching up with what holy people of times long gone have known for millenia. They work together. People have been are are still arguing over what is really the same thing when you strip away the man made bullshit that has been placed on top of it. I don\u2019t know. I realise I probably haven\u2019t eloquently expressed my point well enough but I don\u2019t want to waste any more words.

Whoever learns the inner meaning of these truths will live forever in the Eternal Sea.\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"Everyone who seeks should continue seeking until he finds. When he finds, he will be troubled at the contemplation of Truth, but when he has passed through the time of trouble, he will be astonished at the brightness of the Light, for the Way of Truth is the Pathway to the Eternal Godhead, and the price of the beatific vision is the wringing of the soul. The person who desires to rise above all things must descend below all things, for the way to the heights passes through the depths of anguish, which generate the fires of Life. The person who has suffered and found Life is blessed.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"If you say that the abode of the Gods is in the sky, the birds will arrive there before you. If you say it is in the sea, the fish will arrive there before you. Know that the heavenly realm is both inside you and outside you, and you will know that which is outside by that which is inside. When you have found the Light within yourselves, you will know as you are known. Then you will know that you are the children of the Living Parents and that your destiny is to be as they are. The person who knows not himself, is poor in Spirit, for he is his own poverty.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"Unless you become like little children, you cannot know the meaning of Life, for your minds must be cleared of the falsehoods of this realm if you are to be taught Eternal Truth.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"I am the door; the person who enters by me will find Eternal bliss. I am the bed; the person who lies on me will enter perpetual rest. I am the Light; the person who sees by me will view all things.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"The Way of the Prophets is a trail of tears. I have commissioned you to be prophets to this generation. Consequently, they will ridicule and revile you, saying all kinds of bad things about you. What? Don't you know that they have always rejected the prophets whom I have sent among them? Yes, I tell you the truth when I say that even those who follow the prophets do not understand them, for they speak of the things of the Spirit, which cannot be apprehended by the physical mind. The prophet is alone with the Eloheim, for of all mortals, it is he who sees the reality which he cannot convey to his people. Lonely is the Way of the prophet, but if he brings one soul one step closer to Light, all his loneliness and grief is justified, for great will be his joy in the heavenly realm, and he will become a great company at the seat of the Highest.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"The person who stands alone will be with the Eloheim; the person who is with the Eloheim will stand alone.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"Many of you think that I have come to establish peace in the physical realm. I will not bring peace, but dissension, fire, sword, and war. Families will be divided because of me; friends will stop associating with one another, nations will join in battle. Yes, those who would follow me must be willing to forsake everything, and to stand alone, if they would inherit the realm of my Parents.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; the Way, because you must walk in my footsteps to reach the seat of the Eternal; the Truth, because I am the Eternal God, the Totality of All That Is; the Life, because the Tree of Life, grounded in the Earthly Mother and ascending to the Heavenly Father, is nourished in my blood.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"Learn the meaning of the creation which surrounds you, and you will perceive the mysteries hidden from your sight, for Eternal Truth is recorded on all that exists. I tell you the truth when I say that there is nothing hidden which will not be revealed to the person who can read the creation of the Eloheim.\"\n\n\\# The disciples questioned Jesus concerning the Way of Life: \"How should we fast? In what manner should we pray? How should our alms be given? What dietary law should we observe?\" Jesus said, \"I will instruct you in all these matters, but first you must put off your love of the lie, the false way of life followed by the children of this plane of existence, and be converted, changed so that you hate that which you have previously loved, and love that which you have previously hated. Then I will be able to show you all things, for there is nothing hidden which will not be manifested when you have put on the mind of Truth.\"\n\n\\# Mary of Bethany asked him, \"Will the thirst for knowledge ever be quenched?\" Jesus said, \"When once you have drunk from the spring of knowledge, you will return again and again, for each time your thirst is satisfied, a new thirst will grow, greater than the first. The more you drink, the greater will be your desire to drink, but in the intensity of your desire, you will be filled. I tell you the truth when I say that whoever seeks will find, and the finding will cause him to seek, but in the seeking is hidden the meaning of Life.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"I have ignited a spark in this world, and I will nourish it until it blazes into Eternal Light.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"The shadows of this world are perceived by mortals, and they think they know Truth, but the Reality which casts the shadows is hidden from them, and they do not perceive the Light. I tell you the truth when I say that only when you perceive shadows as shadows, and search the Light, will you perceive the Reality which is God.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"This earth and the planets surrounding it will pass away, and everything will become new. Consider this: In the beginning, you were organized as one body, but when you became two, the illusion of separateness entered the physical plane. Now you are many, and this illusion abounds. Listen to what I'm saying! You must become a solitary person before me, if you want to dwell on the new planets and the new earth which I will create. Those who are enlightened will understand what I'm saying.\"\n\n\\# Simon Peter asked him, \"When you have departed from us, who will give us Light?\" Jesus replied, \"When I am gone, you should look to John, who will show you all the things which are hidden in me. Nevertheless, I tell you, Simon, that you are Peter \\[meaning Rock\\], and you will be a Rock \\[or foundation\\] to my Body. I have given you James and John to be your ministers, to guide you in the Way of Life, for they will reveal to you the order and desires of those who dwell on the heavenly plane. I will build my Body on this Rock of Light, so that the gates of darkness will never be able to encompass it. Amen.\"\n\n\\# Watching the crowds wandering in the marketplace, Jesus said to Mary Magdaline, \"Look at them; they are sheep without a shepherd, for they refuse to hear my voice. The Good Shepherd calls to them, but they reject his barn, wandering in darkness until they are consumed by the wolves and the bears.\"\n\n\\# Jesus asked his disciples, \"Who do you say that I am?\" Simon Peter said to him, \"You are the Ruler of Israel.\" Matthew said, \"You are the Greatest of Prophets.\" John said, \"You are that which cannot be named.\" Jesus said to John, \"I tell you the truth when I say that no mortal has taught you this, but you have been instructed through the Light.\" Then Jesus took him apart and showed him the mysteries of Life, the power of unity through which mortals join the Eloheim. When John returned to the disciples, they desired from him the knowledge Jesus had imparted. John spoke up and said to them, \"If I were to reveal to you at this time the mysteries into which I have been initiated by the Master, you would pick up stones and slay me, and you would be guilty of the innocent blood. Continue seeking, so that you, too, can attain this knowledge and enter into Life.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"No prophet is revered as a prophet among those who know him best, for the shadow of his life eclipses the brightness of his radiant Light. Even his disciples will not know his true nature until he has passed beyond their reach.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"The people of this generation revere the dead prophets while rejecting the living ones. It has been so in every generation. The children of those who persecute you will build monuments to your memory.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"When the outer has become as the inner, and the lower as the upper, then will this world find peace.\"\n\n\\# Nathaniel asked him, \"When you have left the mortal plane, how will we know the Parents?\" Jesus said, \"The Parents are within you. Learn yourself, and you will know me and my Parents, so that where we are, you can be also. You are the sons of the Eloheim. Should the son not be like his Father? You are the daughters of the Eloheim. Should the daughter not be like her Mother? Be careful that you do not pollute your birthright.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"Mortals have been created to dwell in the Garden of Delights. All else is death. Find that Garden where the Parents have placed the Fountain of Love, and you will live forever in bliss.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"In the Garden of Jehovah stands the holy Tree of Life. High in its branches sings a bird. Listen for the voice of the bird, for when you are properly aligned with heaven and earth, she will tell you all things.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"I go to my Parents so that I can bring you to them. Do not weep at my death, for it is my hour of triumph. I am the Great High Priest. When I ascend the cross, I will break the satans' power forever.\"\n\n\\# Mary Magdaline said to him, \"Lord, it is hard to think of you on the cross.\" Jesus said, \"Yes, Mary, a sword will pierce your own soul also, but it is the forerunner of great joy. You also will die in a distant land at the hands of unholy mortals, but death is not the enemy. Live life in joy and welcome death in peace. Then will you be one with me.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"He who takes up the sword will perish by the sword. Do you think that evil can be overcome by evil, or violence by violence? The Way of Peace requires courage and patience, but it will prevail.\"\n\n\\# Simon the Patriot asked him, \"Master, if the gentiles exercise authority over us by the sword, and we take not up the sword to throw of their yoke, how will the divine realm be established?\" Jesus said, \"I tell you the truth, Simon, when I say that the heavenly realm is within you. Only when you have established the divine realm within, and overcome the demons of doubt and fear, will you discern the key to the establishment of the realm of the Eloheim on the physical plane.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"When the Comforter has come, whom I will send to you, he will lead you into all Truth. Search the Light within your souls, for there will you find the reality of all things.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said to Nathaniel, \"You will see angels descending to minister to the Son of Man, and the heavenly realm itself will be opened to you, so that you can understand the meaning of all things.\" Nathaniel said, \"Lord, if I learn the meaning of all things, surely I will die.\" Jesus said, \"Have I not given to you my mind, Nathaniel, so that you could comprehend all things? Do not fear the acquisition of knowledge, for that which you learn now will bless you in the life which is coming.\"\n\n\\# Elizabeth asked him, \"Master, why has woman been made unequal with man?\" Jesus said, \"I tell you the truth, Elizabeth, when I say that in the beginning the Eloheim created mortals male and female; they were one body, perfectly united and absolutely equal. Through the Fall came disparity, and under the Fall there must always be division and disharmony and inequity. Only when you are redeemed from the Fall will male and female cease to exist, for you will become a perfect whole, accomplishing a single work. Only then will the purposes of the Parents be accomplished in the renewal of the physical realm. It is for this reason that I make the female male, and the male female, so that you may be in the physical realm as the Parents are in the heavenly realm.\"\n\n\\# Philip said to him, \"Lord, show us the Parents.\" Jesus said to him, \"Have I been with you for this long time, Philip, and you still do not know me? He who has seen me has seen the Parents. Look, I am the Father of your Salvation, and the Father of Fathers dwells in me, as he will dwell in you through the power of the Covenant. Amen.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"He who looks at a woman, desiring to possess her, has adulterated their relationship already in his heart, for out of the heart proceeds every wrong which afflicts the souls of mortals. If you would not conceive of wrongness, wrongness would not conceive in your hearts. Purify your hearts of the desire to do wrong, and your deeds will also be pure before your Parents, who know all things.\"\n\n\\# Elizabeth asked him, \"Master, how can a person purify his heart of the desire to do wrong?\" Jesus said, \"By thinking right thoughts, which lead to deeds of righteousness. The mind of the Child of Light will be filled with Light, the peaceable things of the heavenly realm. He who dwells on wrongness will dwell in wrongness. The person who is enlightened will understand what I am saying.\"\n\n\\# Simon the Patriot said to him, \"Lord, we are surrounded by wrongness every moment of our lives. Why do you say that we need not dwell in wrongness?\" Jesus said, \"You hear my words, Simon, but you do not perceive their meaning. As a person thinks in his heart, so is he and so is the world in which he dwells. Every person creates his own world, according to that which he fears and that which he loves.\"\n\n\\# Simon Peter said, \"There is so much wrong in the world; how can the world be made pure?\" Jesus said, \"Purify your own hearts, and the world will become pure.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# Jesus said to the multitude, \"You come to me seeking bread, but when you have eaten the bread you seek, you will be hungry again. Look, I am the Bread of Life. He who eats my body will neither be hungry nor thirsty again. Come to me, all you who are hungry, and you will eat the fruit of Eternal Lives.\"\n\n\\# Andrew asked him, \"Lord, what is the fruit of Eternal Lives?\n\n\\# Jesus said to him, \"Do you not yet know me, Andrew? Look, my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink, for he who eats and drinks of me will never die. And the fruit which I give, the fruit of Eternal Lives, is that Spirit of Peace and Love and Joy and Patience which I have received from my Parents.\"\n\n\\# Nathaniel asked, \"Lord, who are the Parents?\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"I am your Father, Nathaniel, but I have a Father who is greater than I. From him I have received all things, and I do only his will. That which I have seen my Father do, is what I do. Therefore, Nathaniel, he who knows me, knows the Parents, for I am in the Parents, and the Parents are in me, and the Parents and I are one. The deeds which I do, I do not do by myself, but the Parents, who are in me, do those deeds. Look, Nathaniel, you should follow me, for in all my deeds, I show you the Parents.\"\n\n\\# Jesus took his disciples to the shore of the lake. \"Observe those who fish,\" he said; \"they wait patiently until the net is full before they draw it in, and they gather fish of every sort. Some they take home with joy, while others are returned to the lake. Nor is every fish which passes through the net caught up with the net when it is taken into the boat. It will be the same with you, if you are to be fishers of mortals. You must wait patiently until the seeker is ready to be brought within the Church. Many whom you instruct will never be brought in, and of those brought in, many will return to the world. Nevertheless, one from a city and two from a region, you will gather the true believers who worship the Parents in Spirit and in Truth. I tell you truly, these are the ones who will overcome the world and inherit all things.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"Mortals go to war so that they can inherit dust. It is because their vision is distorted by the followers of the lie that they value that which is nothing. In destruction there is no victory but for darkness. The power of victory is not force but Love.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"As light disperses darkness, so does Love swallow up hatred, and it is no more.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"The power of hate is strong, but Love conquers all. God is Love.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"The glories of this realm last only a moment; the glories of the heavenly realm abide forever.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"I have come so that you might have Life, for the ways of mortals are living death, but the Way of the Eloheim is deathless Life. The person who walks the Way I walk, though he may die, will live forever, for he cannot be overcome. Death is swallowed up in the victory of Life.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"In me, all things become one, for everything that is not of me is illusion and will pass away. Only Light abides, for Light is Truth, and Truth has no end. I tell you the truth when I say that I am the Way, the Truth, the Light, and the Life. Walk in me, and you will abide forever, for you will be even as I AM.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"I am in all things; yet I am beyond all things. Not through seeking will you find me, but through Peace. Nevertheless, through seeking you will find yourselves, and then will you know the Eloheim.\"\n\n\\# A rich young leader of the Jews, coming to Jesus at night, asked him, \"Good Master, what must I do to be saved?\"\n\n\\# Jesus said to him, \"Why do you call me good? Only the Gods are good, for they are Light, so if I am good, then I am a God, for I am Light. Search that Light within yourself, for it is your goodness and the power of your salvation, when charged with the free gift of the Son of the Eloheim. When you live according to the commandments of the Law, it is the Light that performs your good deeds.\"\n\n\\# The young man said to Jesus, \"I have lived according to the Law ever since my youth.\"\n\n\\# Jesus looked at him lovingly, for he saw the integrity of his soul and the bonds by which they were united before the foundations of the physical realm were laid.\n\n\\# Then Jesus said to him, \"Only one thing remains for you to do. Forsake all that you have in the physical realm, and come with me into Eternal Bliss.\"\n\n\\# But the young man went away sorrowing, because his heart was in bondage to the physical things.\n\n\\# Jesus wept, for he loved the young man and knew the glorious Light he had possessed with the Parents long ago. Mary said to him, \"Master, you offered him everything that you have; yet he has left you. That is really sad.\" Jesus said to her, \"Yes, Mary, for this one I have a special love, but my heart grieves for every soul who does not come to the Light. My heart is heavy when I consider the weight of all mankind resting on me.\" Mary said to him, \"Lord, I will help you bear the weight.\" Jesus said, \"Yes, Mary, we will lift up each other so that we can bear all things. As for this young man, we will claim him, for of all that I have been given, none will be lost, because the Light is in them, and eventually they will come to the Eloheim. Let us rejoice in the power of the Highest, who redeems all mankind when they are ready to be saved.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said, \"Pure Love is a flood which covers all things. Nothing can stand against it, for it flows from the Eternal Sea.\"\n\n\\# Jesus said to Mary of Bethany, \"The true Love, which comes from the heavenly realm, can never die. It will withstand all storms, all temptations, all powers. It will not vary, either to the right hand or to the left.

Supposedly I was a God.  Literally, other people thought I was a God, then I met other Gods.  I'm not trying to demoralize people or cause drama.  I have little desire and am not hungry to the extent of demoralizing others.  I can't always compensate for ideologies in psychology, religion and mental illness.  I would try to improve morale, motivation and positivity, for certain.  I do not personally need anything, I am overwhelmed with this nightmare of a world.  It's not all bad, but, the bad is evident and now we know more with the modern novelties of communication technologies.  \n\nListen, I would go mad with this, I need to talk about this and it is difficult.  It's not as difficult as previous ages, yet, the occurrence of assassination is not out of mind.  I am at sport and delight in the cheap thrills and live for battle.  I am one that does not desire more than comradery and morale for this species... There are others, very bad people, in this world, far more powerful than myself.  I had experienced a lot of intervention of the ages, sadism and bureaucracy...  I do think the Nobility and Governments, bureaucracy knows a lot more of the truth.  I do not think they care to remedy modern or contemporary religious problems.  Most of them are suit just letting things play down and go into the past.  Many of these people just live things down and move on, leaving the past in the past, onto the next day.  It's not something I believe in, but, I'm not able to procure the evidence or conviction to make testaments or retribution of many of the grave atrocities of the past.  \n\nI would try to bring people peace of mind, yet, they must know it is not simple.  These dogma's are part of the problem, divine intervention and all.  Some of us may have experienced the phenomenon of divine intervention, it is not a norm.  Some people are to be in a submissive or slave state.  I can not dotter everything, I'm generalizing that everyone should have a sense of independence and self defense.  The haplessness I have witnessed myself in some people sickens me to my core.  I am not the type of person that abuses or treats others with disrespect or like animals.\n\nI would try to at least warn people there are powers and organizations in this world not in our interest.  The ideas of slavery, genocide and supremacy still exist and are always in action.  That is a fact of nature, the facts of nature aren't all something a lunatic goes on about.  \n\nYou must fend for yourself too!  I personally do not desire worship or piety or believe in these things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll I have to say at most is fend for yourself.  \n\nAbout me, I am a Joe.  I am a soldier and have affinity for the Norse culture and myths.  I have reverence to being born all over the world in different cultures, at different times.  Norse Land is where the Hearth is, I have no other real affinities in other cultures.  Hellas, Greece, Rome, Ireland - Japan, Asia.  I'm not really into the Arabic cultures or India.    \n\nBeing Diplomatic and culturally sensitive is often encouraged, I do not really sympathize or like some of these cultures?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep the status quo.  I'm not one to cause drama, I've come a long way from have psychotic breaks and being confrontational.  We just do not live in a society were anger and confrontationalism is acceptable.  It's painful getting jerked around by pricks, it's just the stakes I have to deal with.  I simple let things go anymore and try and enjoy myself and modern novelties, things had been worse for me in the past, and past lives.  I only have a lot of nightmares to share, little heroic epics and more scandals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are bad people in this world, demons, or worse... Unimaginably cruel and evil beings, completely sick and demented.  I do not know what drove those beings into such states such as \"Daedra evil\".  I mean, some of them stole my breath.... Rape, Murder, Mass Murder... and other atrocities, it's unimaginable.  \n\nI only learned I have a relatively pure soul... I have a radically violent aspect, but I am still a relatively pure soul, I am only as if a cornered animal in self defense.  That is the nature of my alarm.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see no reason to approach the Church or cause to much commotion, I have dealt with my ego.  I have endured grave atrocities, I can part with my own.  I do not need compensation, I just want people to enjoy themselves and make merry.  Mankind has endured grave atrocities and agony coming along... We're always at the pinnacle of our breakthroughs, enjoy them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for spirituality - There is dimension, universe, frequency, realm and even great technology beyond the imagination.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54659, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "If I am a God", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567384872, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cy3ffr/if_i_am_a_god/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Miami_77", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3nsxjep4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567294313, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cy2ogi/remind_yourself/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cy2ogi", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cy2ogi/remind_yourself/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567294318, "score": 18, "selftext": "Just take a second to remind yourself that nothing is permanent remind yourself that things are constantly changing and whatever suffering you may be going through right now will eventually pass.\n\nTake a second to remind yourself that the mind is powerful and that thoughts are exactly that\u2026 just thoughts.\n\nRemind yourself there is only one moment and that moment is NOW so make it the best.

It's called Life. We live it every day, but we often ask what is the point? Simply put it's to come to Know Yourself. But what does that mean? The answer is very cryptic and has to do with religion and the mark of the beast. That's right, the Mark of the Beast from Revelations in the Bible. Now lots of people like to claim that the world isn't coming to an end, but truly for each of us an end will come for us at death. The Bible is a story that runs parallel to each of our lives, just as the Bhagavad Gita and other text do the same. The Bible is meant as a recipe for\u00a0becoming an\u00a0adult. There is a 3rd evolution of mankind, it's called Christ (Kryst). It's what happens to a human if they partake of the Fruit of Knowledge (also made as a metaphor by Terry Pratchett in his\u00a0Discworld series). They are the protectors and they become immortal through the resurrected spirit. That's what the new Testament was supposed to be about but the Church that had been established by Peter decided that it was a good move to throw away 99% of the teachings of the Christ that had come to protect us gave us, and kill all of the followers of those teachings. It's no wonder he elected himself to be crucified upside down because of his unworthiness.\u00a0\n\n\nBut anyways there is a game. The game is called Life, but Life is both the experience and the prize to those who Seek and Find. There is an end to seeking and you will know it when you find it. Just like a video game if you die before you do find it you have to start all over again from the beginning. There has always been the tales of Parsifal's quest for the Holy Grail, and the Alchemist who seeks the Philosopher's Stone to turn his lead into Gold, But what are these tales trying to tell us?\u00a0\n\n\nIn your mind you have thoughts. You think before you act, always. Your thoughts are not you. They come from your body. You have neurons all over your body, not just in your brain. They are in your stomach and in your Heart and in your Loins. They are all connected and sending you thoughts all throughout the day. They propose things for you to do all day. They tell you what you want eat and who you want love and who you want to fuck. They tell you everything that you are afraid of and they lead your every desire. They do your math homework and write your essays. They show you pretty pictures in your mind and then get upset when the rest of the body can't reproduce it the same way it that you saw it in your head.\u00a0\n\n\nNone of these thoughts are you though and that's the Mystery of Life, the Game. You know the one we played in high school,\u00a0that was secret and if you even thought about it you lost? Well it turns out that there is a game that we are always playing. It's lined out pretty well in the opening of the Bhagavad Gita. For those of you who are unfamiliar, the Bhagavad Gita tells the story of Arjuna, the Master Archer. He is faced with a war for his land. At his side is his is his Holy council Lord Krishna (Kryst). He is facing off against an army and the war wages on but with the aid of Krishna at his side he defeats the army and is victorious over his foes.\u00a0\n\n\nThis tells the story of what we go through in Life in our daily lives with our thoughts. We are constantly at war with ourselves, in our mind, against intrusive thoughts, thoughts of impulse and desire, rage and lust, hunger and pain. We are all suffering daily from depression and stress. We are mistaken by our misconception of our place in all of these thoughts. We don't know who we are so we identenfy ourself with all of these things. We say, \"I'm depressed.\" but none of us are depressed, we are experiencing thoughts of depression.\u00a0\n\n\nTruly your mind is like a garden and everything that you take in grows something in your garden. When you do anything to anyone it grows something in their garden. The most important thing that the church gave us was the golden rule, \"Do unto others what you would have them do unto you.\" He said this because he knew that every action that we perform effects us in our mind and works to enslave us by means of our own minds. His secret teachings that were destroyed during the Crusades have been uncovered and can be found in the Nag Hammadi Library, named after the city that they were recovered from. They can be found online at Gnosis.org. They tell us that the mind is the back door. We are trapped at the lowest part of existence and the more that we get enslaved by this place the lower that we sink into a literal Hell on earth. Many people experience this when they fall into drug addiction. It takes over their life completely, giving them no choice but to take them down the path that the drug leads them down. This is Hell.\u00a0\n\n\nJesus or as he was actually\u00a0called during his time on Earth Yahshua, didn't come to just give us the bad news that we are all suffering in Hell. He gave us a way out. The Devil is Ignorant, Blind and Trapped in a body. So the way to escape from him is through Knowledge. Knowledge is power and if you conceptualize the power in the Knowledge that you obtain you become like a God, after all we are made in the image of God. The Son of God called those in his circles Brothers, so wouldn't that make us Gods like him? God is called the Father for a Reason. It's because we are his Children, he is growing us through many lives to become like him. The time of Harvest is coming. The Nutrients that we need, the living word of the Logos has become available to the sleeping seeds within us. Get your portion while the time is here. The time of Be With Us is Now. The Kingdom of Heaven is like a vine with shoots and branches and when the time is right buds will shoot forth and produce lush fruit ripe for the picking and sweet to the taste.\u00a0\n\n\nSo who are you? I've told you many things but of them all I have not given you the keys. I have just shown you the door. Realize that you are asleep. Your body is on autopilot leading you toward a destination. This is what we call Fate. If you do not take the wheel you will meet your Fate and Lose the Game and you will have to start over, ignorant and blind and asleep with no one to wake you up. Wake up! Quit putting poison in your body, it's taking over your thoughts. You have to cut the toxic people and toxic habits that you have picked up.\u00a0Junk food\u00a0and dead animals aren't supposed to go into you. You are supposed to eat food with life in it still to sustain your life force. Otherwise all that you are eating are things that fuel desire and hunger and those things are things that take over your mind to be controlled by the Body instead of the Spirit.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Spirit, what is the Spirit? This is something that's usually kept vague at best. Some people equate it to the Soul, but they are mistaken. The Spirit is something Alien to this place. It literally came from another world to inhabit a body. The Spirit is Adam in the Garden of Eden that the God\u00a0of the Garden put into a deep sleep. That sleep is the one that you just woke up from. If you are still sleeping, please convince yourself to wake up. You are your Spirit. You are heir to the Garden and you have a force within you that is contending for ownership of your property. In fact he's already got stuff built all over it. He's got spots dedicated to Fear to keep you stagnant and unwilling to change. He's got spots dedicated to Desire to keep you distracted, there's always something new sprouting up, a new phone or a new game coming out this November. He told you that you can eat and get lost in the garden that he had built on your property. Just whatever you do, don't Eat from the Tree that gives you Knowledge of Good and Evil. For if you did you would become like a God and then perhaps you might eat from the Tree of Life and become Immortal and rule over his Kingdom forever.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is the meaning of Life. We have been sent here to Fall so that we may Rise. We have been sent here to find the Holy Grail and the Philosopher's Stone and turn our Black Hearts into Gold. The word Philosopher comes from the Greek words Philo which means Love and Sophe which means Wisdom. So therefore a Philosopher is a Lover of Wisdom. The Greeks also had a whole Cosmogomy of Lore surrounding the Love of Wisdom. The Early Christian Gnostics called the aim of their pursuit Sophia, she was envisioned as a Goddess. But truly she was what was gained within. She is a product of the Spirit within us. Much like those marbles in Inside Out, when we experience an epiphany or paradigm shift in our lives, we gain Wisdom because of that. These are the pearls that are gained from our time in the depths of the Sea of Bitter Mourning. We leave the embrace of our Father to Fall into the arms of our Mother. The Name Mary means Sea of Bitter Mourning. Jesus had his mother Mary who was a Virgin, but for the sake of Duality he had his consort Mary Magdalen, who has been called a whore. Likewise, each of us has our own Virgin Mother, the Earth, and we have our Mary who is a Whore, who is our Soul\u00a0. Our Soul is our Consort and she is a whore.\u00a0She whores herself out to all manner of desires and other unpleasantries that are proposed by the body. She is your consort and you must raise her out of the depths of desire and wickedness that you found her in. Like a game of Tug of War, you contend with the body over possession of your Soul. She will only be yours once you free her from the clutches of the Beast. Much like how Mario always has to save Peach from Bowser. The Body will emerge again and again to steal your Princess from you.\u00a0\n\n\nAm I getting clear to you yet? Do you understand the Game? I'm sorry that they threw you in here without telling you. It's\u00a0kind of like a prison here. Without the keys and the knowledge to get out you could stay stuck here until the place burns down. So be steadfast before they come to check on us at the end of the day and kick us out of this place. Don't hide in the trees and be ashamed of your nakedness. Stand proud when they arrive and tell them that you are the Son of the Living Father joined in divine Matrimony with your Consort the tripled powed one called\u00a0Faith Wisdom and Life. If you knew that a robber was coming to rob your house, wouldn't you prepare to confront him when he came beating on the door. Arm yourself with an Armor of Light and a Flaming Sword of Wisdom and Knowledge. Defeat your enemy and Live!\u00a0Amen.\u00a0", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54605, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Game of Life and How to Play It", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567362023, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cxyrvz/the_game_of_life_and_how_to_play_it/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "righteditor", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_88w6k8h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567273684, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cxycd6/sounds_tolerance/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cxycd6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cxycd6/sounds_tolerance/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567279890, "score": 1, "selftext": "Unfortunately, as I have aged, I have become less tolerant of sounds and (unnecessary) noise.

For instance, it is said that an animal can be killed in a sacrifice, yet some maintain animal killing is completely abominable. Although animal killing in a sacrifice is recommended in the Vedic literature, the animal is not considered to be killed. The sacrifice is to give a new life to the animal. Sometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being killed in the sacrifice, and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human form of life. But there are different opinions among the sages. Some say that animal killing should always be avoided, and others say that for a specific sacrifice it is good. All these different opinions on sacrificial activity are now being clarified by the Lord Himself.\"\n\nRef : Bhagavad-Gita 18.2, Purport, Srila Prabhupada", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54605, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "QA : Verse no. 18.3", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567359274, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cxy5we/qa_verse_no_183/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Thedivineplan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4gmhc1bw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567272490, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cxy2ot/september_2019_forecast_for_those_on_the_twin/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cxy2ot", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cxy2ot/september_2019_forecast_for_those_on_the_twin/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567279121, "score": 5, "selftext": "\nOpen communication is highlighted through Heart to heart conversations, making the effort, opening up (4 of pentacles) and reaching out (3 of pentacles).Open, honest communication, the expression of suppressed, hidden feelings will be brought forth to manifest the 5D spiritual energy of this connection into the 3D physical world.

First post on here, so please have mercy. On mobile too, so sorry for the formating.\n\nI was drawn to this redit, to assist with my learning. I have been wondering what has been going on in my life, and why I am here.\n\nI have seen echos of reality, otherwise known as the butterfly effect, in both physical and non physical ways, all of which has been positive or neutral, and highly vibrational. \n\nI feel overwhelmed (literally) by all of the love and positivity from the devine and have been drawn to many places. \n\nI see valadation after valadation of good things. \n\nI've gained personal relations with spirits and my guides (It's draining being receptive and open 100% of the time, though) and they have tought me so much. \n\nBut I feel scared.\n\nI feel like im in an exentental fear loop.\n\nI know that they are there to help. But the fact that darkness (low entitys like demons, dredges, etc.) trys to maliciously interfear is upseting. The way humanity tears itself apart is overwhelming. \n\nYes, there is amazing people around like lightworkers, etc, but it still hurts to see what hapens around humanity (I'm not 100% sure if I am a light worker in general, but this phrasing seems the easist. Im socialy awkward and phrasing is extremely difacult for me.).\n\nI have so many questions, and I want to learn so much, so I guess that I want to know where to look.\n\nSo, enkents of redit (enkents is a word from light language that I can't translate for for the life of me), why am I confused, yet 100% certan and not trusting myself?\n\nWhy do I feel alone when I am surrounded with love?\n\nWhy do I hide my true emotions from those that I care about?\n \nWhy do I shield everybody even though it would help us both?\n\nWhy am a distrustfull of my guides? (I still listen to them, but its like im a wild animal and they are trying to get me to come closer and closer)\n\nWhy am I testing then? (I poke and prod at them, and am always testing them for valadation which is not immedately given)\n\nWhy am I fighting a war?

Recently she has been seeming bad again. She believes in twin flames, law of attracation, being extra positive to attract everything, in numbers of Grabavoy, in loving everyone on this Earth so you can get the best things, in manifesting (Well LOA), aliens and that her soulmate is Jesus... \n\nShe used to be an A+ student, plenty of friends, great role model and then she got married and because she\u2019s too nice her parents-in-law and others from my Dad\u2019s family took an advantage of her and didn\u2019t care about her ever, basically ignored her (and they all neighbors). Then she opened a restaurant with my dad when I was 5 or something like that and it was super successful, but again they were too nice of the bosses and not the best buisnessmen and when 2008 happened they closed their restaurant two years later. Big mistake, big failure and everyone was pittying them or putting them down. I was around 10-11 then (circa 2010 when they closed) and my relatives kept telling what a failure it is and basically making me feel like a child of the worst and least successful people ever which now resulted into me being fucking pressured 24/7 to please everyone and succeed and feeling lost. \n\nAnyway, then she opened a souvenir shop and had it until 2013. Then she went unemployed for 3 years and in those three years she started getting \u201cweird\u201d, she wouldn\u2019t respond when you would ask her something (not too dramatically, but just you had to repeat twice), slowly she stopped going out and lost friends (also lots of debt added to it, my parents borrowed a lot money when they had their businesses), she gained a lot of weight and yeah, she was pretty bad. \n\nIn 2015, she got her first attack and that happened when we went to visit my grandparents/her parents in their hometown. She would kneel for Jesus. Sorry forgot to mention that she is very religious, she has been going to Catholic gatherings since I was born and even before her sickness she would tell people about Christianity and wanted them to be religious and that bothered everyone because that\u2019s what every Christmas table gathering with relatives would look like. But over the years, she became rather more spiritual than strictly Bible religious. She went LOA, Grabavoy, and other positivity people and also believed deeper in different dimensions, she believed she talked with God and aliens, she believed in past lives and would say I was Marilyn Monroe or that we were sisters in past life and shit like that. Many other, I don\u2019t remember anymore. \n\nSo her attack basically looked like she was very spaced out and confused and she thought somebody was attacking her, but she wasn\u2019t extra aggressive but simply stubborn about her beliefs.\n\nShe got meds, all good. A year later, stopped taking them, attack. Back on meds, all good. Another year after, no meds, attack. Back on meds, all good... until recently - now she is taking meds, but she hasn\u2019t seen a doctor since 2017 and she was skipping them slightly. Throughout the past year, she wouldn\u2019t mention religious stuff or anything like that to anyone because she ain\u2019t stupid, she knows we would tell her to stop. But she used Facebook (I checked her phone the other day) and other messaging systems and basically messaged a lot of people about those stuff and basically, she never really got well. Because now she is not spaced out or confused or is seeing things, but she believes in those things and twin flames and she is sometimes a bit slow. This made me realize, she simply believes in that and she can never get healthy again. She told her colleagues at work that their boss is her twin flame and lover and that the restaurant She works in is actually hers (all not true and all shocking...).\n\n\nNow that was history. Basically, I\u2019m scared of so many things now and this post got so long, but I don\u2019t know what I will do. I\u2019m scared of spirituality and religion although I slightly believe in LOA and soulmates but I think I shouldn\u2019t anymore. Also did I mention i am pressured and wanna die?

You must think that way, do not think complicated.\n\nIn all traditional culture, religions, ritual, ceremony, when you want higher level deity/being help, which mean you want to buy **a item** from them. In exchange, you are giving/selling to them a item call foods, drinks.\n\nYou must treat the savior Messiah/Mahdi/Maitreya as the same as a super deity/being like that.\n\nSo what you need from the savior is just an item you cannot buy anywhere else, an item call knowledge, information, solutions, ideas. But if you do not giving the item that savior request/want, then you will never ever able to receive the item you want from him either. That is very very basic rules exist from at least 10 of thousands year on Earth.\n\n**So where and how to find that savior Messiah?**\n\nRemember you guys need an item from the savior, not the Messiah himself. So you guys do not need to care who the hex he is. Just like in many secret trade market, everyone want remain anonymous, all the matter is item.\n\nAs a authentic savior Messiah, I can tell you this. All of you who are still in the matrix system, you guys may able to swim fast in the swimming pool, lakes, but not yet to know how to system in the Ocean. I as the Messiah now may not able to swimming fast in the pool, but know how to swim freely in the big Ocean, it just matter of time and do I really want to swim fast or not.\n\nSo without guidance &amp; help from me, it would be next-to-noway for you guys to able to control &amp; swim in the Ocean freely.\n\n**Here is the secret code and my requirement:**\n\n**Step 1:** Process Zimbabwe ZWR series money in exchange for cryptocurrency with a minimum rate of 1 Zimbawe dollar equal 1 microgram copper/copper. As soon as possible, **must occur before 15th October 2019** (within 45 days from now).  \n \n\n**Step 2:** Setup a website: solution for reward with big donation in cryptocurrency and tell your problems, questions, desire. Anytime you want but step 1 must be completed first.\n\n**Step 3:** Pray &amp; Hope the Messiah come to that website and tell you everything you want to know.\n\nI can easily answer and give you out-of-this world solutions for everything including, trade war, currency war, spiritual explanation, future, etc. until you satisfy.\n\nYou guys may ask why donation in cryptocurrency.\n\nBecause donation take no tax no need to talk to any authority, while cryptocurrency for safety, anonymous.\n\nRemember the sooner the better, the later the less chance for me the Messiah come to help you guys.\n\nThis is the very low risk with super big reward. When you do not know the lottery number, but some one claim he/she know it, it is better to test and trust him one time, rather than said \u201cno way with your opinion from your view of point in your head\u201d, of course the view of point from he/she is completely different.\n\nYou can continue living under the Babylon system in a big swimming pool till dead where you pay for hours, instead of paying for result only. The choice is yours, choose quickly before it too late.\n\nEverything happen for a reason, nothing happen by chance. And the only universal reason I can help you guys is receive offering from you guys first.\n\nThis is the last duty as the savior Messiah I can give &amp; help you guys, which is a working explanation &amp; guide. The result of your life is from your own action, not from others, but can you choose the \u201ccorrect\u201d Divine action or not is another story.\n\nRegard,\n\n**Savior Messiah Mahdi Maitreya**", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54559, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Secret Code, A Only Truth Way To Receive Help From The Savior Messiah", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567336905, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cxuvf8/the_secret_code_a_only_truth_way_to_receive_help/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ClayBoots", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_kz4zf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567248558, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cxumal/love_the_thing_that_i_most_wish_hadnt_happened/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cxumal", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cxumal/love_the_thing_that_i_most_wish_hadnt_happened/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567248559, "score": 4, "selftext": "[Link](https://youtu.be/YB46h1koicQ)\n\nStephen Colbert, discussing the loss of his father and brothers when he was 10 years old, with Anderson Cooper, whose own mother died recently.

I\u2019m writing this for context. My main question will be listed below all of this. \nMy journey I guess you could say started 6-7 months ago. It was quite sudden but it felt like it needed to happen when it did for me. I went through a very hard time with the sudden realizations. And I knew these weren\u2019t my own affirmations because these things I was coming to realize were very difficult and things I would like to deny. I had to face a lot of tough things about myself. My first real realization was realizing the ways I myself have been incredibly toxic. And this hit me rather hard considering I grew up in a abusive household. The kind where I\u2019d always remind myself to never become like my family. Once that first realization kicked in, they didn\u2019t stop. It was like everything I knew was crumbling down in front of me and I wasn\u2019t in control of that, and I couldn\u2019t go back. Once I saw all of it for what it was, there was no going back to how I thought about them before. \nThis was all sudden for me. And the first few weeks were so awful and painful for me, but it all feels necessary. I felt myself in a way, getting healthier. And even more spiritual. I also realized a lot of my interest in spirituality only came from just that, interest. I thought it was cool. But that went away too. And I felt scared and broken but it just felt like the next step would be to try and dive into it genuinely.\n\n\nMy main question is this. I don\u2019t know many people who have gone through this kind of thing. And I\u2019m currently in a very stressful part of my life where I feel like nothing is in order, and I almost feel like that has stunted my personal growth. How do I get back on track? Where do I start? Has anyone gone through this? What would be your advice? I think I just need some guidance. \n\nThank you for reading.

This was said unto the apostle \u201cSimon peter\u201d it just reinforces that the future has already happened therefore there is \u201cnothing new under the sun\u201d which is true.                                                                                 \u201cHave I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!\" Jesus said this. If time has already happened then what are we doing here in the present? If this is earth we are on then this could be purgatory of some sorts and we just don\u2019t know and don\u2019t have the capability of ever knowing. when we die we might have to restart our lives to the point in where me hated it the most. I was in blackpool tonight and all i could see was absolute trash and jerking off clubs in where people have a good time. In other words people bum one another spreading there cancerous DNA about and burdening children to exist in this messed up world. Genetically, naturally, mentally. It is also written \u201cit is better for us not to be born than sin against god\u201d i wish i never existed in the first place i think being in that place of death where there is no consciousness is far better than being awake and seeing how superficial and selfish this world has become. Sex sex sex and rape and oh look at him oh look at her Mmm. Sex. Im hard me lad come on and fight me. Blah blah blah Primitive humans we are. We humans have just gotten out of the caves still. Im also a genetic f up im Small, ugly stupid, speech impairment, scar faced, lonely. I guess if god is able but not willing then he is Malevolent? Or should i say that our pathetic primitive brains arent allowed to talk about god because the \u201cFlesh\u201d will only think about the \u201cflesh\u201d.

I'll try to keep this real short because I don't want to bore anyone. I always knew I was gay, but whenever I would be effeminate around my dad he would lash out at me. So I shunned myself in front of him. I also felt guilty being around my mom too long, but I could at least be a little effeminate around her. Anyways I grew up basically asexual because I was denying my feelings for 17 years. I came to the conclusion that there is no way being gay is wrong (although deep down I probably still feel like it might be im not sure) When I was a senior I started dating guys, and I went absolutely boy crazy. I loved the validation I would get and I wasn't used to it. I eventually had a boyfriend, who turned out to be amazing and loving and caring and it turned me off I think (not sure why?) and I ran away. I realized this was a mistake and spent 3-4 years trying to get him back- feeling guilty, like it was my fault, and trying so hard to impress him basically. After I realized it was going nowhere, I would attract guy after guy after guy that I would lose myself in, try to impress and hold down, and then get abandoned in the end. Either they didn't like me or there was a third party but it would always make me feel like how my ex made me feel. I basically just want to know what's going on here. It literally seems other worldly and I hate to make big claims but no matter WHAT I do, I ALWAYS attract guys who reject me if I like them and it's always after a month or two of talking. It's like a never ending cycle.

Like Matt Fraser, John Edwards and others. All their teachings seem perfectly consistent. Here's my conclusion with everything. You can go and listen to these mediums and find my ideas make some real sense.\n\nThe biggest problem in human life is that there is no problem...that's the problem. It's all an illusion. Spiritually speaking what I mean is all of our arguments we have and the disagreements. Our ''problems''. Even when we think we have a problem. We don't. From the beginning of life there was nothing happening. We look for ''problems''. We create them. To keep us busy til we die and go back home to god. And even then through out all that... There was nothing happening. Nothing is happening in the after life or here in the living. \n\nHere's another thing about spirituality. The thing I dont like about what is happening is that when we come to live we pick bodies that over react at problems and situations. We knew what they were gonna get into and we still don't the handle the role right. Yes were in a role. As spirits coming to live we are prone to becoming discriminate and hateful. I would say even psychotic and when we cant control our anger or frustrations we end up causing emotional or psychical dis stress on others. All because the role we chose became over whelming, but who's fault is that?...ours. Listen if you cant handle the role you chose.. go back home to god and start over, but don't be causing emotion dis stress or physically harm on others. Nearly all the entities (us) from the [afterlife](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/afterlife?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG) that come to live in this world don't even need anyone's help. I'm talking about the people that we can interact with in America. We all live very well and have many people to help us with problems that may happened. Most of the time we can solve our own problems. We are supposed to help each other, but most of the time we don't need each other. For example lets say that you have a friend or someone you like that's in jail. You call them up to ask if they need help paying for the bond and your friends says \"No my relative is gonna help pay for that\". Or you try and give them advice and mother and fathers already given them that advice. Everyone has everything to their dispose to help them self's. What are we doing here then? There's no real lessons here. \n\nThe other thing about spirituality is that if everyone was born a [medium](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/medium?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG) they would not be the person they are now. They would be to caught up in the spiritual that anything else would not matter. For example Bruce Lee would not have been a martial artist and Micheal Jackson would not have been a singer. They came to be closed off from the spiritual so that life can develop their personality and desires. Leading them to live the life they live now. Or was with MJ. Creativity and art would not be pursued as much because it's the closed off spiritual life that perpetuates it in the first place.\n\nListen what I'm giving you is common sense that even the after life and living can agree.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54459, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What Ive Concluded After Hearing From Alot Of Spiritual Mediums...", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567287000, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cxn81h/what_ive_concluded_after_hearing_from_alot_of/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "avoqueen", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ee6k5r0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567200009, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cxn3ih/i_lost_my_dog_almost_a_month_ago_and_ive_been/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cxn3ih", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cxn3ih/i_lost_my_dog_almost_a_month_ago_and_ive_been/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567200011, "score": 4, "selftext": "I lost my dog, everything I lived and breathed for, almost a month ago due to a tragic incident that happened after I had left the house. I felt so guilty that I wasn't there for her, protecting her like I had promised to do. I've been a wreck since she passed, and I feel like she took a big part of me when she left our earth. It's been so hard for me to deal with what's happened and how it's happened, and it's something that seems impossible to overcome. \n\nI've been speaking to her since the night she passed, telling her how much I love her, how much I miss her, how thankful I was/am to be blessed with such an amazing dog, thanking her for being there for me when no one else was, thanking her for teaching me so much love and patience, telling her about my day, about my other two dogs and how much we miss her, and I've been asking her for signs to let me know that she hears me and that she's still here with me in spirit. Before I got her ashes back, I would hold her collar and snuggle her blanket to get that connection to communicate. \n\nWhen they were ready, I went to go pick up her ashes with my dad. We got back into the car and looked at the time: **2:22 pm.** He immediately asked me what it meant, so I looked it up - \n\n*\"The meaning of number 222 suggests that you are at a point in your life where you are looking for some sense of balance. This means it's the best time to have faith and to keep trusting. ... And in case you didn't know this, the numbers 222 also mean peace and harmony.\"* \n\nWe started crying, knowing that it was a sign from my little Bean. Since I got her ashes back, I've been wrapping them in the blanket she came to us in when she was a puppy cuddling them as I would with her, giving them strokes as if I were petting her, and of course, giving her little kisses. I bring her ashes with me when I bring my other boys for a walk (she was a pug, so she's very small and her ashes fit in the palm of my hand - the same size of her belly when she was a puppy and I was able to scoop her up with one hand). She sleeps beside me on my bed with the boys. I swear one night I felt her on me. I'm uncertain, as it was very late at night and I had partaken in my nightly smoke, so I was also a little stoned so I could have been imagining it. \n\nThe night before last, I was having a very rough day, I couldn't stop crying, thinking about her and how much I miss her and everything about her. I reached out and asked her for strength and for a sign, as I didn't think I could recover from this, and the day felt impossible. I apologized for being so destroyed, as I know she never liked to see me sad. I was laying in bed, looking through my photos of her, specifically, the last photo I ever took and something caught my eye - the time. **2:22 pm.** The time of the last photo I took of my baby was 2:22 pm. I felt her more than I ever had before. I hugged her ashes tightly and kept thanking her. A wave of relief swept over me. I felt calm, a calmness I hadn't felt yet since her passing. I felt like this moment would be a moment I would burst into tears, as I've been crying so often since I lost her, but I just felt calm and peaceful. \n\nI've been feeling so guilty lately because I hadn't dreamt of her since her passing. Had I been dreaming of her and just not remembering when I wake up? The thought of that hurt me. I would never want to forget a dream about my little girl. I asked her to visit me in my dreams as I would love to see her again. Last night, the night after I saw her last photo with that time, I finally dreamt of her. I saw my baby again. It was a relief. I don't remember most of the dream, but I do remember the gist of it. In my dream, it was back to the day when it happened, Aug 2nd (another 2 - does this mean anything?). I was at work (where I was when the incident happened) and in my dream, I knew it was going to happen. I knew I had gone back in time and I was able to stop it from happening. I was telling my coworkers that I ***needed*** to leave, but it was difficult to get them to allow me to. I remember the time was ticking down. I was barely going to make it if I needed to save my little Bean. My alarm, unfortunately, woke me up before I was able to finish the dream and reach the conclusion. \n\nI felt, and still do feel so much love from her. I miss her with my entire heart and I think she knows that and feels it. I want to find out more ways to be able to speak to her and have her communicate with me. I need that connection with her.

I call it negative because it brought unto me a tremendous feeling of dissapointment and dissatisfaction with my existence . This time was different , because it made me change and after that day I decided to start meditating on a daily basis in order to free and stabilize myself mentally (I'm not diagnosed with anything) . 1 week after my meditation practice began , I started seeing the number 42 rather frequently . Seeing one number is no big deal , but with time things got a lot stranger . I began reading into the law of attraction , the Kybalion and how my thoughts affect my reality . After making those initial realizations , my life did a 180 and I was literally showered with blessings from every side . I was satisfied with everything and many more synchronicities and unlikely events started happening to me .\n\nWith time , I started seeing many more numbers literally everywhere I go , I'm even seeing 44 as I write this post . From seeing two or three numbers , things came down to me stumbling upon : 11, 22 , 33 , 44 , 55 ,66 ,77, 88, 99 ; 8888 , 7777 , 2222 ,1111 ; 111 ,222 , 333 ,444 ,666 ,777 ; 39 , 42 , 44, 47 ,49 , 447 , 449 , 442  and probably some other number which I cannot think of right now , on an almost daily basis .  Of course I can't see all of them every day , but I am pretty close to being like that . \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know that the point of synchronicity is to steer me in the right direction and I'm very open to that .  Seeing so many numbers though , I think that there might something else , which I can't seem to figure out .\n\nReading from surface net sites like trustedpsychismediums and thesecretofthetarot does not do the trick . They sound cliched and exaggerated most of the time . I'm not saying they're not good sources or anything , but personally I dont feel like they are . \n\nCan anybody please help me understand those numbers ???", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54414, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Synchronicity", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567266587, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cxirig/synchronicity/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Karmicpatterns", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3z2ygbu3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567178354, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cxicoy/can_you_identify_where_you_live_emotionally/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cxicoy", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cxicoy/can_you_identify_where_you_live_emotionally/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567178355, "score": 51, "selftext": "Asking yourself some deep questions and then taking the time to awnser them can be one of the greatest tools to get to KNOW yourself.\n\nMy answer to the question above:\n\nI use to live in fear until I realized it and did something about it.

This is the instruction of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. But activities leading to advanced spiritual knowledge are not to be given up. This will be made clear in the next verse. There are many prescriptions of methods for performing sacrifice for some particular purpose in the Vedic literatures. There are certain sacrifices to perform to attain a good son or to attain elevation to the higher planets, but sacrifices prompted by desires should be stopped. However, sacrifice for the purification of one's heart or for advancement in the spiritual science should not be given up.\"\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 18.2, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n**Related Pic

im only 33 years old, i\u00b4ve transended what you call being in love, i\u00b4ve moved to a state of love where she is a part of my own being, i love her for no reason, she is my true part-ner, i will love her forever no matter what, the same way i love my doughter or my mother.\n\nunconditional love is the only true love, all other may be product of emotional attatchment, product of your fears, because ther is no distinction among the love you have for one or the other, when you love you love with your whole being, you dont put barriers on true love, you put not limits on true love, the problems you have with love is your fear not to be corresponded, you fear give all of you and receive so little,if you are in need for love is never going to work, having expectations of what a relationship should be, and then the person does not fullfil your expectations and then blame the other for not fullfiling them, but you dont realize the problem is your expectations, you\u00b4re trying to posses the other one, you\u00b4re demandig love from the other for you alone.\n\nwe are trying to adjust love to our neurotic way of living, to an untarual way of living; marriage is not natural to humans is society given, a human invention, a mens invention; an invention that turned women into a commodities, even under divine commandment; man now have become master to the woman. this is a perfect example of how a lie repeated many times becomes a truth, you were instructed to belive this way of life is the only way of living, however you see most of relationships ended up bad, or if they stay togheter but they\u00b4re miserable, marriaged is not love intended, is to ensure the continuity of the species, to ensure men inherit their desendents making sure they were his. women had no very few options without men\u00b4s resorces.\n\ngreat news those times are up.\n\nthe time for women to raise up to power is here, i\u00b4m a man; simply recognizing the true place of women in society, all spiecies have a dominant heirachy, for humans is female-dominated naturally, this is why men had to repress women, supress their sexuality, even punish it, but those times are up, it is time for you to stop looking for prince charming and realice you dont need to be loved, you are love, you can only share love, but first you need to find yourself, be self sufisiant, find fullness in life, women in the past were not allowed to have a life on their own, they passed most of their lifes raising childrens, so we need to counter those centuries of repression, they are only in your head, is the mentality your were imposed, asume leadership in society because is your rightful place, even now your duty because earth needs you to correct the mess men have done on their lust of power.\n\nthis is your millennia so take your place as the queens you are.\n\nthank you for reading this, let me know of your comments", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false,

For instance, it is said that an animal can be killed in a sacrifice, yet some maintain animal killing is completely abominable. Although animal killing in a sacrifice is recommended in the Vedic literature, the animal is not considered to be killed. The sacrifice is to give a new life to the animal. Sometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being killed in the sacrifice, and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human form of life. But there are different opinions among the sages. Some say that animal killing should always be avoided, and others say that for a specific sacrifice it is good. All these different opinions on sacrificial activity are now being clarified by the Lord Himself.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the different opinions of various sages regarding animal sacrifice ?**\n\n**.**\n\n**Question 2 : What is the meaning of the word do\u1e63avat ?**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/zh/18/3](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/zh/18/3)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54349, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 18.3", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567237212, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cxdp59/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_183/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "parasparivaar306", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_40d58yzb", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567148357, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cxdd0h/get_information_about_different_types_of_kaal/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cxdd0h", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cxdd0h/get_information_about_different_types_of_kaal/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567148357, "score": 0, "selftext": " If you want to get relief any kind of Kaal sarp dosh, you can get options to choose the best astrologer in India.

The song kept repeating and getting less and less until it was down to a single beat beat or music note. The buzzing got strong and kept moving, where ever this buzzing would go I would twitch, like my arms or leg. And a tunnel of color started to appear Then I got an idea in my head that just popped out of nowhere \"There are hidden frequencies in music.\" I must have lost that thought at least 4 times before I was just barely able to put it down. Then I lost the music note. I tied the process again and \"home\" singled out and it started repeating \"hommmmmmmmmmmmmme\" evenutally when the feeling of buzzing came back and the tunnel of color then I started to get anxious and I lost it all. When I got up I was shaking like my whole body was shaking like there was too much energy. The next day I was listening to spotify and a commercial for The Beatles came on it put on parts of there song and stuff and at the end of the commercial it said. \"Sometimes it feels like some else has written all the songs\" The worst part was I was awake when this all happened and I wasn't on any drugs, which is what makes it so strange.\n\nThe last time I did it it was very similar but when I was a few mins in I started getting flashes of an abused little girl\n\nI have been trying to get answers for a while and not many people have responded.

Hypnosis can penetrate deep into our subconscious minds, and our subconscious mind is what I would describe as a \u201crecord book\u201d, or a \u201chistory book\u201d, that stores the information of all of our previous incarnations. As soon as I was in the hypnotic trance, memories of what I assume to be my most recent incarnation flooded my mind. Shortly after I began to piece together my past life, I was a man in the Songhai empire in the city of Gao. I remember seeing the city being attacked and barraged by fire arrows, and the buildings catching fire. After coming out of the trance of hypnosis, I began to do research on of this event actually happened to Songhai, and to my surprise it actually happened. Turns out that Songhai was captured by the Moroccans, and of course the city of Gao was captured by the Moroccans. I was definitely skeptical about this, but before I had this experience I never knew anything about Songhai or Gao, and the memories from my past life were so real to me.

In the third six chapters, knowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and transcendental nature, and devotional service were described.

Ke\u015b\u012b was a most formidable demon who was killed by the Lord; now Arjuna is expecting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to kill the demon of doubt.\"\n\n  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 18.1, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/cx2xhk/qa\\_verse\\_no181/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/cx2xhk/qa_verse_no181/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54232, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "QA : Verse no.18.1", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567181192, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cx2xwh/qa_verse_no181/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "HisThrowaway1990", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_pvjgi9j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567094793, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cx2xsf/energy_shift_illnesses/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cx2xsf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cx2xsf/energy_shift_illnesses/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567094796, "score": 17, "selftext": "Is anyone else struggling through all these massive energy shifts? \n\nI\u2019ve been experiencing extreme migraines, skin break outs, allergies (haven\u2019t had them all year), and flu like symptoms.\n\nAre there any tips to manage these shifts better?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54232, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Energy Shift Illnesses", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567181180, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cx2xsf/energy_shift_illnesses/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Ilovedrugs12", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_32d4mzrx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567093968, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cx2r65/moment_of_clarityconfusion/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cx2r65", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cx2r65/moment_of_clarityconfusion/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567093970, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey, I\u2019m 19 and I\u2019ve always been good with kids, and I\u2019ve been volunteering all summer and stay fascinated with how they can manage to be so present at all times, even though these were all from damaged homes.

Is there any proof of God\u2019s existence? Has anyone ever seen God? Where have we come from? Where do we go after death?\n\nThese are some questions which have definitely traversed our minds at some stage whether we call ourselves a theist or an atheist. However we haven't been able to source a satisfactory answer to these questions to date.\n\nAll religious leaders, saints and priests have failed to provide substantial evidence to support claims they make about God. Due to advancement of science, some of these claims fall short of logic and raise more questions. Moreover there is large scale ambiguity in claims made by saints and leaders emanating from the same theological background be it Hinduism, Christianity, Islam etc \u00a0which undoubtedly pushes an individual, at times, to doubt the authority of religious texts and also raise questions about the existence of God, sometimes turning them agnostic.\n\nIn this article most of the doubts about existence or non-existence of god have be cleared, that too with cogent evidence.\n\nWhat is the meaning and definition of Theism and Atheism?\n\nBefore we delve in to explaining why people become atheists, let us define what is theism and atheism.\n\n\u201cTheism\u201d is the belief in the existence of, at least one God, and all his relative attributes. \u201cAtheism\u201d, on the other hand, is the absence of belief in the existence of God.\n\nDoes an Atheist have any belief?\n\nThere are a range of belief systems prevalent among people. At one end of the spectrum there are people who rely on faith rather than reason, which is termed as \u201cfideism\u201d whereas at the other end there are people who reject all religious and moral principles in the belief that life is meaningless, which is termed as \u201cNihilism\u201d. Atheists certainly denounce fideism as they consider the statements and stories mentioned in the religious texts to be apocryphal. They happen to be anthropocentric as they consider humans and their existence to be the most important and central fact in the universe. The concept of heaven or hell is simply not to their taste.\n\nFacts &amp; Figures about Atheism\n\n**Despite the fact that atheism is gaining popularity across the globe**, no amount of scientific calculations are\u00a0able to put life into dead. All the prevalent theories about beginning of creation including [**the Big Bang Theory**](https://www.jagatgururampalji.org/creation-of-nature-universe) fail to answer the cardinal question about how life came into existence? These are still theories and lack scientific evidence to back up the claim.\u00a0\n\nAtheists, like most other rationalists\u00a0can't explain their own existence;\u00a0and all the scientists of the world still don't have any answer to\u00a0this\u00a0basic question, \"**what puts life into the cell in the mother\u2019s womb that leads to the formation of human body?\"** which is worth keeping in mind.\n\nHistory of Atheism and THEISM: why atheism came into existence?\n\nIn earlier ages, **everyone had faith in God**. They worshipped God according to the [**Holy Scriptures**](https://www.jagatgururampalji.org/en/gyan-ganga-river-of-knowledge/holy-scriptures-also-the-witness-of-kavir-dev-god-kabir/). Children were sent to Gurukuls (schools) for attaining **spiritual as well as social knowledge about life**. With gradual deterioration over thousands of years, spiritual dilution occurred. Slowly the holy texts also got adulterated. Selfish priests started propagating false and arbitrary knowledge as per their own whims. People started doing pilgrimages, keeping fasts and worshipping stones and as a result moved further away from God. A**ll these methods of worshipping God are forbidden in holy Bhavagad Gita and Vedas.**\u00a0This caused a gradual decline in\u00a0benefits achieved from worship of\u00a0God causing a further loss of faith in God.\u00a0When people stopped getting the **benefits**\u00a0of **worship**, their belief loosened. They thought when we have to get **fruit of our karma** (actions), then why\u00a0is there a need to\u00a0[**worship God**](https://www.jagatgururampalji.org/en/way-of-living/68-which-god-should-be-worshipped-according-to-gita-way-of-living/)**?** \n\nThe advent of modern day science added fuel to fire by encapsulating\u00a0this concept in the bracket of \"logic and evidence\" which they have been unable to explore and prove to date as their means of experimenting is faulty.\u00a0\n\nThe actual term atheism emerged in the 16th century. The non-believers contented that atheism is a more parsimonious position than theism and that everyone is born without a belief in deities.\n\nTheist vs Atheist; Who is right, Theist or Atheist?\n\nAtheists simply don't believe in any God. One of their arguments is based on \"Theodicy\" which transpires, how\u00a0God\u00a0can\u00a0exist\u00a0when there is\u00a0evil\u00a0in the\u00a0world. Another argument is based on \"Existentialism\",\u00a0a belief which says that\u00a0the\u00a0world\u00a0has no\u00a0meaning\u00a0and each person is alone and completely responsible for their own actions by which they make their own character. They tend to lean towards \"Rationalism\" whereby actions and opinions are\u00a0based on reason rather than\u00a0emotion or religion.\u00a0\n\nTheists on the other hand believe in the existence of God. The truth\u00a0is that there are varied\u00a0belief systems prevalent amongst theists which is\u00a0due to their religious orientation.\u00a0One belief system is not in agreement with the other or at least the interpretation of one is not aligned to the other. Take for instance **Hinduism**. Most Hindus believe in 3 gods (Brahma, Vishnu &amp; Shiv), some believe in Goddess Durga, some\u00a0believe in one Supreme God where as there are scores who believe in 33 crore deities. **Muslims** believe in One God \"Allah\" but they know nothing more about Allah. For them Allah is formless and communicates through his messengers and never appears in form. **Sikhs** also believe in One God, but they don't have any name for that God. For them too, God is formless. Likewise **Christians** are misled. Half of them believe\u00a0Jesus to be God but the other half calls him \"Son of God\". Despite this, they still consider him formless.\u00a0\n\n**The truth of the matter is that the beliefs present in various religions are contrary to what has been mentioned in their Holy Scriptures**. None of them have been able to comprehend their scriptures properly as a result of which they are all in the dark.\u00a0\n\nThis brings up a larger\u00a0question as to who should be called a \"Theist\"? Does mere belief in God classifies someone as a \"theist\" even if all their practices and beliefs are opposite to those ordained in the religious scriptures? However both of these\u00a0groups fail to derive any benefit whether they believe in God\u00a0or not because\u00a0their way of\u00a0worship is wrong. So false way of worship feeds atheism.\n\nNow What should Atheists and Theists do?\n\n**The ultimate aim of human life is to get complete salvation** from the **circle of birth and death**. This\u00a0is possible only by following\u00a0the path mentioned\u00a0in our **holy scriptures**\u00a0and by **taking initiation** from a\u00a0[**complete saint (who happens to be Spiritual Leader Saint Rampal Ji)**](https://www.facebook.com/spiritualleaderSaintRampalJI/).\u00a0\n\nHinduism\n\n**Vedas**\u00a0are attributed to Hinduism and\u00a0considered as **Supreme knowledge**\u00a0but they are not just restricted to Hinduism, as Vedas were\u00a0present before any **religion** came into existence. Therefore Vedas are for the entire humankind.\u00a0**Earlier everyone used to follow Vedas and did worship according to the Vedas and chanted \u2018Om\u2019 mantra** after taking initiation from a\u00a0**Guru**. But because Om mantra is\u00a0also incomplete, they never derived full benefit from their worship. This happened because their Gurus could not understand the gist of the Vedas.\n\nFor instance i[**n Rig Veda**](https://www.jagatgururampalji.org/articles/post/rig-ved-god-is-in-form) it is written that **there is only one God whose name is\u00a0Kabir\u00a0(Kavir)**. **He is eternal and looks like a human. He resides in his eternal heaven i.e. Satlok. He is the** [**creator of the entire Universe**](https://www.jagatgururampalji.org/en/creation-of-nature-universe/15-evidence-of-natures-creation-in-god-kabirs-speech/)**.**\n\nIslam\n\n**Likewise, in** [**Quran Shareef and Quran Majeed in Surat-al-Furqan 25, Aayat 52-59**](https://www.jagatgururampalji.org/en/quran-sharif/surat-al-furqan-allah-kabir-in-quran-sharif/), it is clearly stated that **Allah is Kabir**. **He has created the whole universe**. **He is in Human Form**. It has been\u00a0further said\u00a0that if you want to know about the true way of worship of that Supreme God, then go to a\u00a0**Complete Saint (Bakhabar)**\u00a0who\u00a0will tell you the right way to reach **God Kabir**. But the **entire Muslim community** **believes that God is Formless**. So when their belief is wrong\u00a0then how could their way of worship be correct and how can they derive benefit from their worship?\n\nChristianity\n\n[**In Bible, Genesis**](https://www.jagatgururampalji.org/en/bible/god-is-in-form-holy-bible/), it is clearly written that **God created humans like himself** i.e. in **Human Form**. But contrary to this, all **Christians believe that God cannot be seen**. They consider **God to be\u00a0formless**. This proves that their entire concept about God is arbitrary\u00a0because it does not match with Holy Bible. So their way of worship too is a complete waste and hence fruitless.\u00a0\n\nOnly those who followed the true worship of Supreme God Kabir derived the full benefit. Renowned Saints like [**Guru Nanak Dev\u00a0ji**](https://www.jagatgururampalji.org/en/shri-guru-granth-sahib/grandeur-of-a-guru-in-sri-guru-granth-sahib-ji/)**, Dadu Saheb ji,** [**Garib Das Sahib ji**](https://www.jagatgururampalji.org/en/gyan-ganga-river-of-knowledge/sant-garibdas-ji-maharaj/)**, Malook Das Sahib ji** and many others have followed true worship. **God Kabir himself** came on **Earth,** met these pious souls and showed them his\u00a0Satlok\u00a0(eternal place). The **sacred speech** of all **these** S**aints**defines the **glory of Satlok** and **God Kabir,** and they have also written about the true way\u00a0**of worship to attain God Kabir and the paramount importance of attaining a Complete Saint.**\n\nWho is that Complete Saint and how to recognize him?\n\n**At a time**, **there is only one complete** S**aint on earth**. There is evidence in [**Holy** ](https://www.jagatgururampalji.org/%language%/vedas/)[**Vedas**](https://www.jagatgururampalji.org/%language%/vedas/)**,** [**Holy Bhagavad Gita**](https://www.jagatgururampalji.org/en/shrimad-bhagavad-gita/who-delivered-the-knowledge-of-shrimad-bhagavad-gita/)\u00a0and other [**Holy Scriptures**](https://www.jagatgururampalji.org/%language%/holy-scriptures-books/) that whenever there is a decline in virtues and an increase in unrighteousness, God either appears\u00a0Himself on this earth or by sending His most knowledgeable Saint\u00a0reestablishes dharma by means of the true knowledge. He imparts\u00a0true worship according to the scriptures.\n\nDo Theists and Atheists also need to consider what Saint Rampal Ji is preaching and Why?\n\nSaint Rampal Ji Maharaj has caused a spiritual revolution. He\u00a0has revealed true knowledge from every Holy Scripture and\u00a0is imparting the right way of worship to his followers. It is because of this true worship that all the followers are deriving the true benefit of worship. The benefit is twofold. One is that people are able to lead a satisfactory life in this world without any misery, disease, discontent etc. Secondly they become worthy of liberation.

There are certain sacrifices to perform to attain a good son or to attain elevation to the higher planets, but sacrifices prompted by desires should be stopped.

So, I have compassion for my anger.  I have compassion for myself.  And that is why I allow myself to feel it, and to live it. \"\n\n\"By not throwing the blame for my emotions, anger or pain on anyone or anything, by taking TOTAL responsibility for it myself\u2026 that is how I become a master of myself.\"\n\n\"Because after all\u2026 love cannot exist in fantasy.  Love can only love that which is real.\"\n\n\"Totality\u2026 this is where our power comes from, this is where joy comes from, and this is what allows us to experience love.\"\n\n\"But I just wish to say that when I say \u201ctruth\u201d, what I am referring to is what IS, without any need or desire to try and understand it.  It is acceptance to the utmost degree.\"\n\n\"But there comes a point in a man (or woman\u2019s) life when he has to realize: I am responsible for my experience.  If I am miserable, it is my fault. And nobody else\u2019s.\"\n\n\"As an individual, I stand alone\u2026 without any Christ, without any Buddha, without any master at all\u2026 and I and only I get to feel what is right and true for me.\"\n\n\"And it is not weakness to go astray.  If you are not certain, then be uncertain!\"\n\n\"I want you to throw all of these things out.  I just want you to be yourself, and to live without any ideals and to love and care for yourself unconditionally, just the way you are!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks folks.

This can be scary but instead of asking for help I\u2019m going to put out there how I\u2019m dealing with it. \n\nAs my reality is shifting I\u2019m becoming more aware that everything that has ever existed, is now. Everything that ever will exist, has already existed. \n\nI say I\u2019m hitting a new level of awareness but I correct myself when my thoughts say this. There is no new level, there has never been any levels, levels are concepts in relation to ego and succession. There\u2019s just... Now. Here. This. Everything else comes and goes. \n\nI\u2019ve found myself enjoying the ride more, watching myself, my thoughts, the world around me, all the projections at play, the subtle nuances in every interaction and how to interact with that, not being attached. Even though I\u2019m enjoying the ride more it can be scary letting go. Seeing yourself in action, being aware of more fucks with your attachment to your identity, to your guard. \n\nOnce you begin to see the construct/puppet strings the veil begins to slip. Shedding skin is going to be scary at times, sometimes I look in the mirror and find myself looking at a shell. My vessel. I\u2019m intrigued and I explore the feeling instead of shying away or taking drugs.\n\nEven though waking up to my reality shifting is quite frightening to my sense of identity, I\u2019ve found that  this transition is what I\u2019ve been waiting for. Transcending is never what I thought it would be. Getting to where I want to be is never what I thought it would be. What I thought was a draft. \n\nSometimes it feels pretty surreal watching the world go by hearing sounds more vividly, seeing synchronicities more clearly. Hearing the wind communicate.

I will try the best I can to describe elaborately the day that I mastered myself and received the best birthday gift from God a human being can receive.  \n\n\nThis may not be the best writing style, but I hope it will be understandable so you can have the benefit of learning something from my example, and I do hope you really enjoy it and find yourself within it, and get something out of it. :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, to skip the story short, after I started reading the Bug Free Mind Process by Andy Shaw, I was finally for the first time introduced to my nutter (Ego) and I realized that I have power over it. Shortly after I have quit drinking, quit smoking, and quit drugs, expect occasional marijuana joint. I also distanced myself from negative egoistic friends and alienated myself from society, I went off the radar so to speak. I remembered that Jesus told me to distance myself from my old friends, that I am not like them, and that their company was harming me. So I told them not to take it personally, that I am doing it out of love for my self.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cost of sanity, in this society, is a certain level of alienation. \\~Terence McKenna\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's better to walk alone, than with a crowd going in the wrong direction. \\~Diane Grant\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBlessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers.  \\~ Psalm 1:1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhoever walks with the wise becomes wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm. \\~ Proverbs 13:20\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen suddenly I said goodbye to few of the friends that I had, except two, who I felt were not harming me with their presence. Although looking back now I realize that was a mistake too, because after nearly a year, I was seduced back to old ways again and I fell from grace, but that is a story for another time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to the story. So I started walking alone, following the narrow path of the heart that leads to life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spent over 8 months at home studying and working on myself, basically self-educating myself each and every day, raising my vibration in every way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShortly after came 4th January, 2014, it was my 20th birthday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up more cheerful then ever, more joyful, and much more happier but not because it was my birthday, it was more a thing of my self mastery, tho having a birthday while having so high vibrations made it a truly special day indeed. The moment I woke up I remember thinking to myself, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Now I am even more higher and happier, because of the thought that it is my birthday, why not fool my mind and think every day that it is my birthday and feel so amazing everyday?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realized how powerful tool the mind actually is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater that day someone on facebook told me that the sun was closest to Earth that day, that thought also raised my vibration for a notch, it became even more special day to me, as if the Sun came closer just for me, as if God was reaching out to me to celebrate the two decades of my life with me. Thinking back how suicidal I was throughout life and remembering the battles with my demons, that two decades of my life was the greatest miracle I am aware of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n It was winter but it was warm and very sunny day. Sun was shining with White and very Bright Light, and I was so intensively present and aware that my awareness was radiating like that white bright Light of the sun, I felt like Love &amp; Light from high above. I felt like I was the Light of the Sun, and its warmth was like the love of my heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I didn't have any special plans to make a party nor did I expect guests. I felt pretty amazing because I achieved a quite impressive control over my mind and emotions thanks to Andy Shaw's (Bug Free Mind Process) teachings and thanks to my inner Guru.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was 99.99% egoless and naturally very happy and high.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want nor need any gifts from no one. I knew that no object could bring me happiness, but that happiness is my true nature and that my True God Nature is the one and only real happiness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was simply happy and grateful to God, and I continued expressing my gratitude to God throughout the day. I didn't desire any birthday gifts from people, instead I was grateful to God like He had already gave me the best gift of all, after all, I felt like the most blessed and happiest person alive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the day I had a feeling that God will give me something and I was grateful like He already did.  I subconsciously knew that something will happen and I was in joyful expectation that God will give me the best birthday gift a man could possible imagine, but I didn't want it in any way, I didn't wait for it, nor did I need it. I was simply grateful as if it was already happening here and now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was alone in my room studying, listening to music, and raising my vibration . I was drinking water and reading the Bug Free Mind Summary of Techniques which I wrote down in a notebook.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I was practicing and applying techniques,  I was very present and in full control of my mind, and I raised my vibration so high that I have created an impenetrable force-shield.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I went downstairs to eat something, and my force-shield was about to be tested by my 70 years old, brainwashed, unconscious grandmother. (not judging, just a fact)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy grandmother came up to me to wish me a happy birthday and while she was congratulating me she started crying that no one bought me anything. That was completely miserable, insane and funny situation. I was in middle of drama and her nutter obviously wanted to ruin my day. She wanted to say that no one bought me anything, but she wasn't even aware what she was saying, she said on Slovakian something like \"No one can do to you anything or no one can harm you\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I was going away from her I said to myself and out loud at the same time \"That's True, no one can do to me anything, no one can harm me, and I don't need anything from people, because God will give me and already gave me the best birthday gift ever\". I was grateful like never ever before in my life and thanks to my impenetrable force-shield of Joy and happiness her unconsciousness passed through me. I didn't allow the lack thought in and I remained in control of my emotions, feelings and thoughts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I went to living room, stood there for a moment, and then I simply inquired within and asked my heart what should I do. There wasn't any specific answer so I just went with the flow. I went back to my room and I think there was a random remix song playing in which Bruce Lee says:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Empty your mind. And as you empty your mind you will become formless, Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mind or consciousness was still, formless, and shapeless like water.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suddenly realized I was going the way of the spirit, the way of Tao, although I had never before  read anything about Tao Te Ching, the realization came from beyond my finite brain, it came from the heart. And now, I can add, that knowledge is for the mind, but the wisdom comes from the heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen for the first time I went to read about Tao te Ching, and the first quote I saw was:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrue mastery can be gained \n\nby letting things go their own way.\n\nIt can't be gained by interfering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI, My consciousness or awareness, didn't interfere with the world of form, I didn't engage in thinking, I was going with the flow of Life. There were brief moments when ego appeared or we could say sneaked in shortly, but I was very present and it appeared ridiculous and nonsensical to me. Whenever it appeared I said out loud to myself \"Dont identify\" (with voice in the head) and it automatically vanished. I was aware of the voice, but I didn't really pay any attention to it. I was in a state of complete non-attachment, non-identification, desirelessness, stillness and intense presence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was detached from the physical plane, detached from the world of form, outside the material world as it were. I was dis-identified from my own body and  mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could easily discard all thoughts and feelings from my awareness, they were just passing by like passengers, and I didnt pay attention to those passengers. I didn't feed the thoughts with my attention more than 2 seconds and my mind remained quiet, still, silent, formless and shapeless. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the whole day I was in complete control of my thoughts, feelings, emotions and actions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI refused to hold any thoughts in my awareness, and I didn't identify my self with anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy consciousness was radiant like the Light of the Sun. (God is light and in Him there is no darkness. 1 John 1:5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy vibrations were so high, my awareness so radiant and my presence so strong, that when the ego appeared briefly, that darkness could not survive even for a second in the Light of the I AM Presence. I easily recognized the nutter and disidentified with it immediately, it was effortless thing for me to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEgo appeared absurd or ridiculous to me, like some remnant, shadow or an echo of illusion. How could I even lose control over my mind if I had not with whom to fight for it? Ego cannot survive if he hasn't got on whose attention to feed on. It is only an illusion and we are the ones keeping it alive. I can label ego as a Low Vibrational Mental Illusion. Ego appears only in the absence of awareness, there is no ego in awareness, as there is no dark in light, no fear in love.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was very centered and I was surrendering to the Lord (my Heart/Self) throughout the day, with total lack of personal self-concern and only the pressure of the Heart desiring and expressing to be more of the Nature of God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was surrendering whole day long and my candle of awareness was lighted up for Jesus, meaning I was aware of Him the whole time. I had lit on a lamp of awareness and love in my mind and heart for Him and it shined whole day long. Jesus was my best example which I was to follow and the  greatest inspiration. I desired to be just like Him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt so good and loving to be in such state of pure awareness and to be so close to my dearest Brother that I can't describe those holy feelings in words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat day I was reborn, I felt like when I was a child, I felt my long forgotten true pure inner self.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was filled with Love and Light. One moment I felt Jesus so clearly and intensely that I had energetically felt his touch on my shoulder, my shoulder became warm from His touch. I felt that He was cheering me on to raise my vibration higher and higher, to come ever closer to Him, for there is no barrier between us. I became so inspired by Him that I had passionately strived upwards to God with my entire strength, mind, soul, heart, body, and my whole being. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I remember it was already getting dark outside and I started to read the Science of Getting rich for the first time. And after I had read Wallace Wattles famous syllable:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"There is a thinking stuff from which all things are made, and which, in its original state, permeates,\n\npenetrates, and fills the inter-spaces of the universe.\n\nA thought in this substance produces the thing that is imaged by the thought.\n\nA person can form things in his thought, and, by impressing his thought upon formless substance, can\n\ncause the thing he thinks about to be created.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt expanded my understanding and changed my perception instantly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat were mind-changing words to read at that moment. My mind was formless and shapeless and in close touch with this thinking stuff, and I realized that in fact I am One with this formless substance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was aware that my mind and my consciousness was not separate from God's consciousness, and I knew that I Am One with God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGod is Universal, Multidimensional and Cosmic awareness. Nature of awareness is consciousness - existence -  bliss. And I was aware that I AM individual consciousness of God's Mighty Intelligence and that we are One in essence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow After reading few pages of science if getting rich It was already dark outside and two good friends came over for a drink. From all that I have distanced myself I remained in contact with only those two, because they were the only one who didn't drain me, and the thigns I loved to talk about, they gladly listened. had changed their hearts and converted them at that time, they knew me since childhood, and they were very curious about my new state of mind and what caused such an transformation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow as they walked into the room I remember the voice in my head appeared to greet them in some old usual way(something like whats up bro's) but I immediately ignoring my friends looked into myself from where the voice came, and then I inquired out loud \"who is seeing this?\"  As I was looking within myself the voice vanished and it was nowhere to be found, and I remember the faces of my friends thinking \"what the hell is this guy doing\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo cut long story short, they had some wine and I was drinking water. After some time I didn't see what to talk with them anymore since they did not have the same high state of awareness as I did. We use to smoke weed together so I decided that because it was my birthday, I could give my self a treat and relax, beside, I haven't smoked a couple of weeks. That was the only desire I had that day, although I didn't even really desire it, but I felt it was okay, that I deserved it. And so one friend went to buy some weed...from a friend that I have distanced myself from earlier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so we got high and once again my self-control was put to test. It was a great test for me not to hand myself over to the drug and feel bad. My emotions and thoughts got little wild and out of control for few seconds, almost out of control. The drug briefly disturbed my peace, but not for long. I didn't hand myself over to the substance and I pulled myself together and remained in control like a captain of the ship and master of my soul.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I concentrated and focused my attention, my mind became one pointed and I focused my whole attention on intention which was to meet and talk Andy Shaw (creator of the Bug Free Mind Process, which is part of my life purpose as Jesus revealed to me), and in that moment I felt as if my desire had already came true. Experiencing that desire as fulfilled in that moment made me feel incredible. it was very rewarding experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that I also remember sort of exercising my body for a moment by jumping into air and simply moving my body, that gave me an additional boost of endorphins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter I managed to feel good and remain in full control after getting High I used the additional high emotions to deliberately raise my vibraton even higher through affirmation saying \"I Am stronger than negativity, I am stronger then negative vibrations. I vibrate on high frequency. I vibrate on Love. I Am Love, I Am Light. I Am Love &amp; Light.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that moment when I suddenly looked into myself and shifted my entire attention within myself, or we could say when I mentally inquired \"who am I?\", then my consciousness or awareness, and my view of the world which what-is-seen became transparent to the extent of Light, as if I had transcended body consciousness, and was outside of my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt would be appropriate to say that the world didn't appear solid, it didn't appear real, as if I had transcended it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like I was seeing from my brain, but I wasnt in the brain.  It seemed like I was above and through brain, although not contained within it, I was all-pervading awareness, eternal being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost the vision of the material world, even tho it was in my sight, and got lost or merged in the One reality shining within and outside of the spiritual heart. I entered into the Kingdom of Heaven and got lost in the God-head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy whole perception was transformed, I felt this deep connection to all that is. I perceived everything as interconnected Unity. I became one with  the Formless, shapeless, infinite intelligence.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt would be true to say that I became One with God. One with Eternal, Infinite, Awareness of Love and Light.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt the presence and company of heaven and I experienced something I have never before experienced in my present lifetime,  but still it was an extremely familiar and known feeling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt this great peace, bliss and oneness, but it is impossible for me to describe this experience with words. While in that state I also remember turning my head slightly aside and not thinking but becoming aware of: \"Jesus is not separate from me, he is here, where else could he be\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also remember while in that state of awareness, if I had a desire to create  anything whatsoever, or if I had a desire for something specific, I would just magically take one step forward and just go and do it, just create it. In that moment I possessed the full power of Creation and the power of God within me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I was in that transformed state of being I said, or summarized that whole experience with just 5 words which I repeated twice. My whole experience explained or expressed in those 5 words, and it was very obvious to me what I was saying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFew seconds after speaking those words one friend turned around and looked at me and said something like\"your head is glowing\"and after our eye contact I crashed back to normal state of awareness, and I wasn't  really  aware what just happened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was amazed and I thought to myself that I had experienced, discovered, or realized something extraordinary. I thought that I just had some Great Discovery. I didn't know what happened, I just knew that I had to write it down immediately.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I immediately took pen and paper and started to write down my discovery, but there wasn't much to write Except those 5 words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I started re-thinking what I have said I wrote words: \"I Am stronger than negative vibrations. \n\nI Vibrate on Fear ------------\\[\\] Love. And I wish to become only that I Am\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the first thing that have I wrote were those 5 words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJa som to Ja Som\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTranslated to English:-   I AM that - I AM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy whole experience can be summarized in those 5 words: I AM that - I AM \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, through complete command over my mind I maintained complete control of my thoughts, feelings, emotions and actions. I refused entrance to all negative egoistic thoughts, and I didn't identify myself with my mind and denied my individual identity and surrendered to God or the Self. Where there is no slightest trace of ego, there is the Self.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy Raising your vibration you will activate your blocked DNA strands and you will connect to your Higher Self. You will have  5th Dimensional consciousness as we will have when we Ascend. You will merge into Oneness and become One with God in awareness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I surrendered to God, He manifested Himself as the guru through me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cGreater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world.\u201d \\~  1 John 4:4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn other words Greater is your True Self which is the Heart itself then your egoic mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat day my heart was leading the way, the mind was under  the control of the heart. Heart is the Self. God, Guru and Self are One. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy raising my vibrational frequency to Highest possible level I re-activated my blocked DNA strands and achieved the full potential as a human being. I merged into Oneness and became One with God. Or it would be proper to say that I received a birthday gift of Enlightenment, Liberation and Self-Realization from God. I received a piece of Heaven, a glimpse of Ascension.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI  was so completely disidentified and detached from the material world, and so powerfully present and aware that the ego could not exist in the Field of my radiant presence, consciousness, and awareness of Light and Love. There wasn't even a slightest trace of Darkness, Illusion or Ego. When I discarded everything that I am not, what remained was only that (what) I Am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that is Christ Consciousness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow to summarize in words what I experienced and what I desire to share with world and teach the majority.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI Became One with God,  I connected and became One with my Higher Self, I Merged into Unity, I merged into Oneness of Universal Consciousness, I Experience Self-Realization, Liberation, Enlightenment, God-hood, Christ Consciousness... I entered into the Kingdom of Heaven which is within me, or in other words for a short time I have Ascended. I became One with I AM - that -&gt; \"I AM\", which is God, And I re-traced my steps and figured out the map of how to get there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would say that Self-Realization, Enlightenment, Liberation, Oneness, Unity equals becoming One with God. And I made process for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is what I am here to teach people, God gave me this gift so I can lead mankind to Ascension.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThus, the proof of the Teaching and the Path is that it leads one successively to that higher and higher consciousness where unto the individual is assumed into the very heart of the I AM Presence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd this is the reason why I have come here, this is what I want to share with world and teach majority, this will be the main subject that people will be taught and trained in Ascension Center (Ascension Academy)  \n\n\nPS- Remember, You are a part of Him Who is All Power and All Glory, and therefore Unlimited as He Is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone wishes to support me, I have paypal: [johnoflovelight@gmail.com](mailto:johnoflovelight@gmail.com)\n\nBut to hear that I somehow helped, motivated or inspired anyone, feedback would give me my spiritual bread :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!\n\nLove &amp; Light, \n\nNamaste,\n\nDJ.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54137, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Birthday Gift From God (Literally)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567128771, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cwu4yl/birthday_gift_from_god_literally/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Shiestybih", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_wz6u0mm", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567041829, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cwu158/life_mirrors_back_to_you_your_subconscious_beliefs/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cwu158", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cwu158/life_mirrors_back_to_you_your_subconscious_beliefs/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567041829, "score": 2, "selftext": " \n\nHi guys, I'm new to this subreddit.\n\nI just wanted to say I am genuinely interested in the idea that reality mirrors back to you the direct relationship you have with yourself. Growing up, I had a really rough relationship with my father. I was gay and I knew it from a young age, but I was also extremely scared of him. I knew when I was effeminate in front of him, he would reprimand me. I grew to resent him, because all I ever wanted to do was to make him proud, but I realize he didn't really love me for who I was on a deep level. I never told him about my sexuality, because I wanted to maintain our superficial relationship. You could definitely say I had \"daddy issues\"- but I would never admit that to myself. I never admitted any of this to myself. I never even knew this made me emotional to think about until recently (im 22). For 17 years, I was content with not really thinking about my dad at all. \"he doesn't get me\" \"I can't wait to leave\" were the things I told myself instead of facing this obvious issue.\n\nInstead, I threw myself into relationship after relationship trying to impress men I knew didn't even really like me (basically exactly what you would do if you had daddy issues). If you asked me while I was in it, I would say I was \"in love\" and boy were my emotions on a high at all times. These turbulent relationships would never last. It seemed to me that no matter who I became, no matter the level of chemistry I thought me and this other person shared, it was just never enough to keep the connection going. I would ALWAYS hit a wall and they would always painfully leave me. It stumped me for five or so years! I became suicidal over the thought that no one would ever love me, and I would exert ridiculous amounts of energy into people I didn't even really care about just to prove to myself I even could have a relationship at all. Looking back, I realize nothing I would say or do to these people was the problem at all. The problem was me operating on a fragmented belief system that I never turned around to question. The beliefs that I would play in the background of my mind, that I'm sure many people do:  \nI have to prove myself to receive love.  \nThe way I am deep down isn't good enough.  \nIt's normal for men to not like me unless I do things for them.  \nBeing scared of your partner, not being able to understand their emotions, that's part of love.  \nI do not deserve a love that comes easy, or that is stable. Even, I do not deserve love at all. I am a sexual being, and my mind is worthless so I should just shut up and try to be pretty.\n\nHow is love supposed to grow when this is how I felt deep inside? The people I have attracted into my experience mirror these beliefs back to me- not as punishment, but because how are you supposed to read the label from the inside of the box? I felt inadequate in my relationships, because at my very core I felt like I was inadequate. The treatment of these people is largely symptomatic of my underlying disease- a terrible relationship I had with my self image. If I could never intimately meet myself, then these people would never intimately meet me either. The deeper I went into my psyche, my self worth, and my life in general- the deeper all of my relationships became. I became less isolated in dating, friendships, even in my routine work life. I just felt genuine. We need relationships to show us where to heal, how to grow, and what needs work. When you can grow with someone, that's when the flings stop- but until then, and for a good portion of people, heartbreak is a powerful vessel for soul growth. When I finally decided to become honest about my beliefs, and forgive my dad- I slowly began to start breathing. Literally BREATHING.... I did not realize how shallow my resting breath state was. As I decided to rewire myself into someone who deserves amazing treatment. Someone who has something special to offer someone, and someone I would even like to meet myself- I began to attract people who saw that light within me too. This was only after I saw the light within myself.

Self-doubt, doubt in general, negativity, sadness, and anger all mixed with a huge dose of pain. \n\nThe day that I received the direct message from God, Higher self, Angels, etc. I was in a self-destructive chaotic episode where I cried for 9 hours straight (I was on a transatlantic flight). \n\nAs I wiped my tears away, I begged God for a sign. At that moment I remember reading something somewhere where the girl who wrote the post said she asks for direct messages from angels, God, higher self etc. and she receives them. \n\nAlthough I remembered that, I was doubting it but I gave it a try. I said \u201cGod, please, I am begging you please, give me a sign in a form of the color purple\u201d. I chose purple for its meaning of royalty but also bc it is my least favorite color, i do not own any purple items, or clothing that would be significant. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until later the same day later that night that I received the message that changed my life. We went to dinner with my entire extended family (we are relatively small compared to \u201cnormal\u201d families in America). The night ended and it had gotten a little chilly. We decided to walk my cousins and aunt to their apartment since the restaurant was nearby. \n\nWe walked for a little bit, I wasn\u2019t showing any signs of being cold, I didn\u2019t say anything, and I was dressed more warm than my cousins were. But my grandma out of the blue, mid conversation takes off her jacket and wraps it around me from behind. We went back and forth on whether I need it or not until she said \u201cI just know you need this right now\u201d \n\nThis was when I realized the jacket was purple...the jacket that my grandma wrapped around me was purple.

I have always had a knack for \u201cmanifesting\u201d things, even as a small child. As I\u2019ve gotten older (only 22), I have had three separate \u201cpsychics\u201d tell me thus, and that I have a natural ability for it. Already being a very spiritually inclined person (I am a devout Buddhist) I don\u2019t take these things as anything bad or worth pushing away, and generally I just roll with them and let them integrate into my life since, well, they are a part of my life. However, in the past month it\u2019s been getting more and more prominent, probably as much as it\u2019s ever been since I was a child. 8 out of the 10 past days I have guessed my weight to the point when I step on my scale every morning, I\u2019ve had at least a few dozen instances where someone says what I was going to say in a conversation or cuts me off before I speak and says what was on my mind, and today has been the weirdest of all. \n\nFor starters, today at work one of my older co-workers was telling me about the Black Sabbath song \u201cMr.Crowley\u201d which is about Aleister Crowley, the famous occultist. He said that one of the lines in the song was \u201cMr.Crowley, won\u2019t you get off your white horse\u201d and I said \u201chuh, like symbolism\u201d. Later I listened to the song, and the actual lyrics were \u201cMr.Crowley won\u2019t you ride my white horse? Mr.Crowley, it\u2019s **symbolic of course**\u201d and I freaked. Less than an hour later, my friend, who is somewhat of a spiritual confidant of mine, texted me some of those old leaked CIA files that talked in-depth about the law of attractions and the holographic universe theory, and I told him my experience from earlier, as well as everything which has been happening recently, and he said \u201cI think you may be starting a new journey\u201d. Not to mention I\u2019ve seen 11:11 twice a day for the past two weeks when I randomly look up at a clock/something on my car/anything with numbers displayed, mainly right after I have some sort of mini spiritual epiphany in my head. I replied, however, \u201cgood because I was worried I may die soon lol\u201d\n\nFlash forward to just a half hour ago, I am playing CS:GO on my PC with Spotify open, and I think about what I had texted him earlier. Not even 30 seconds later the song \u201cYou\u2019re Dead\u201d by Norma Tanega came on and afterwards the song \u201cPassage\u201d by Papadosio. I\u2019m effectively a little shook.

(Think over eons, not centuries). Consider the mass extinction going on today, the burning of the Brazilian rainforest going on right now, radiation from Fukushima, oil spills, acid rain, poisen in the water, none of this is good for *us*, but life exists regardless. Extremophiles will always find a way, new species will descend from them to fill in gaps where the old die off. We could completely deplete the Earth of oxygen, and as long as the conditions of life still exists, life will exist, even if it's anaerobic.\n\nWe are doing the equivalent of shitting where we eat today, but it's not an offense to the planet, truly even the pollution itself provides shelter for life. Life exists from the uppermost atmosphere to miles underground. There are areas on this planet too dangerous for us long lived humans to live where other species flourish unhindered, filling every niche.\n\nWhat we fail to understand as a global culture is that it's really not about us, we've come onto the stage in a glimmer of an instant and we'll find a way to eradicate ourselves eventually if not by random external means of global devistation; that is the grand cycle of life. If you believe the fossil record, I don't think the dinosaurs nuked each other. We think in terms of decades, life on this planet lives in terms of millennia. \n\nMourn only for ourselves, the planet and a vast flourishing range of species, flora and fauna, will thrive in our wake in newer and stronger forms. A million years from now, we're going to be as monkeys playing with fire to those advanced creatures pondering what we were.\n\nLong after any signs of our existence remains (in terms of the scale of time for continental subduction to occur, or burying by dust), a new culture will ponder the very same thing we do, and that cycle will continue until the sun itself is exhausted. I believe it has happened before in other ages.\n\nI don't think we'll be here to see the sun extinguish in a life ending ball of plasmatic explosion, nor would we want to be; the continuation of homosapien is a very shortsighted goal at any rate. Whether we will leave a mark on the future species of this planet through our genetics is irrelevant to anything that will come after us, in any case I strongly doubt we'll leave much behind for future historians to consider.\n\nWe live now in a golden age, an age of decedent indulgence with no spiritual meaning. The age of pleasure is upon us. Some time in the future, homosapien will be in an age of either enlightenment or suffering and hardship but regardless, our successors will give us the same courtesy as we gave to neanderthal. Total and complete annihilation, and a history rewritten without remorse.\n\nHumans aren't all that bad, after all, we're here to learn, and in this process mistakes are made. One wrong move from here and we're doomed, true, but that's no different then when our ancestors left the trees and roamed the Earth hunting mammoths.\n\nI don't think what I'm saying will be recieved well because of our own hubris and inflated self-worth as a species. As stuarts of this planet we've shown ourselves to be of the worst variety, but the good news is that this planet and billions of years of new species will succeed us. Will they even know we existed, and if they do, will they think of us as primitive as Neanderthals, or tyrannical as dinosaurs, terrifying or beautiful? This is what we as a spiritually advanced species should be considering if we think of our legacy.\n\nSo it's not hopeless, we're not hopeless, but the seeds of the age of suffering or enlightenment will be sown by us and felt by our grandchildren, or perhaps their grandchildren. What will *they* think of us? A victim of external events or a devil that caused the suffering? That's up to us and how we act as individuals. The Earth, the environment, will still be a place where our successors thrive regardless of state, as it always has been, even if it's eventually too toxic for us ourselves to survive. Our catastrophe is their opportunity. \n\nSpirituality means to me perseverance dispite advertisity. I will do what I can even if no one else does. I want to leave something beautiful behind, even if it's covered in your shit.

You just feel it different,\" he explained in a way that made it seem like the most rational thing in the world \"when it's both of us together\".\n\n\n\"But you feel it too. Why don't you ever tell me?\"\n\n\n\"I'm telling you now. Why do you ask so many questions?\"\n\n\n\"Because you give me answers,\" I told him, \"even when you don't, you do.\"\n\n\n\"And you speak in circles,\"\u00a0\n\n\n\"Only because the circles lead me to you. Every once in a while.\"\n\n\nAt that, he stopped saying the things from his mind out loud and retreated back into it. But he allowed me to stay there. Mostly, I'm sure, because he wasn't quite ready to leave mine.\u00a0\n\n\n*You know you're an addict, just like you were always afraid you would be.*\n\n\n*Ha. That's not me. It's you.*\n\n\n*Does it matter? You know and I know. That's all that matters. What is there to win if that is the truth? There is no one to win to ...or win for.*\n\n\nI thought about the old cliche \"like a moth to a flame\". When we are drawn to something that may be bad for us, we say we are the moth. We keep coming back, we say, despite the fear of burning our wings. But couldn't it be equally true that we are the *flame*? That thing we think will kill us has been inside us all along? And we see our darkness, only now it burns bright and flickers right in front of us. And it's there, in the eyes of our lover. Because *we ourselves* are the ones who are on fire.\n\n\nI spent so much of my time with him trying to figure out who was the moth and who was the flame. And it was then, when we each looked inside the other, that I understood it didn't matter. We were both. We were neither. We were all of it. We were whole, alone and together. \n\n\nOne plus one makes one.\u00a0\n\n\nMy life, it seemed, had been a long quest to find love. But now that I'd found it, I didn't even recognize it. This was so far removed from what I'd been looking for that to attach to it that word, \"love\"-one that women use about men they presume to \"cherish and obey\" and men use about women who presume to do so-seemed cheap and impotent.\u00a0\n\n\nI wanted to ask him whether he heard me while I thought about this, whether he agreed or dissented. Or whether he just felt me think these things and couldn't put words to them any more than I could. But I knew the question would only cause him to fly away from me so he couldn't be burned. Or so he couldn't burn me. So I only pulled away from kissing him, held his face in my hands, and carefully brushed his hair aside. I looked into the eyes with the flames in them that he so often tried to hide from me. He pulled me back into him and I pushed back away again.\u00a0\n\n\nSo what is it you think I am addicted to?\n\n\nThe same thing everyone else is. Your Self.\n\n\nI hated it when he did that, when he saw me clearer than I wanted him to. Or than I could see my Self. But there was also no greater pleasure to me than this particular sort of pain-and healing-that only he was able to give me.\u00a0\n\n\nI'd seen the black of a man's dark heart and I'd seen the white glow of those with relative purity. And I couldn't stomach either of them. Each was too simple, too easy, too flat. He was both. And all. He was gray and every other shade, too. And, of course, so was I. \n\n\nSo, too, are We...\n\n\nI showed him the things we'd done earlier that evening, as I'd felt them in my heart. He took me to the place we first met. We each ordered a drink we knew the other would want most and we shared them together, each sip helping us become less of who we thought we were before. We talked about those people with an arm's length sort of fondness we'd feel for old friends. We marveled at the things that happened since to change us into what we'd become now... A boy from India and a girl from Texas, a Soul from infinity, sharing cigarettes and stories of made-up selves. \n\n\nHe moved his chair closer to me. I thought about all the chairs I'd moved toward all the men before, how they always stayed and let me come to them. Sometimes, they ran and sometimes they tried to own me, but either way, they always left, or maybe I did, because they weren't the one I loved the most. They were not me. \n\n\nWe sat for a while and he said he'd be right back. When he wasn't by my side, I felt him still. But my mind told me his wouldn't come back. He'd leave me there since that's what I deserved. His mind filled with the thought that I would be gone when he returned. \n\n\nI exhaled when I saw him come back to me. I'd been holding my breath, I guess. But I don't know why. \n\n\nWherever you go, that's where you are.\n\n\n\"What do you want with me?\" I asked with my voice.\n\n\n\"The same things I want without you. Only I want them with you,\" he told me, \"as it should be\".\n\n\n*Who are you to know how anything should be?*\n\n\n\"And who are you?\" he said to me aloud as he gently brushed the hair from my eyes, \"You don't even know whether you are the moth or the flame\".\u00a0", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 54074, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Twin Flame suggested I share this...", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567104678, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cwp23a/my_twin_flame_suggested_i_share_this/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "CozOfMyCuriosity", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4gwviqkr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567014524, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cwo7yu/please_clarify_my_doubt/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cwo7yu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cwo7yu/please_clarify_my_doubt/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567014527, "score": 1, "selftext": "What is the F\\*cking point of the soul when it forgot the past life (body dies and everything erased, who cares if soul exists and entered other body) and why the concepts of god, punyam(good deeds), papam(bad deeds), life after death etc.. just for some hallucinatory peace being dependent of some imaginary power?\n\nAfter listening many stories in scriptures of india and spiritual articles, this doubt is haunting me.

What is the process to achieve this goal ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** \"In the conditional state, people are attracted to worship demigods, ghosts, or Yak\u1e63as like Kuvera. The mode of goodness is better than the modes of passion and ignorance, but one who takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is transcendental to all three modes of material nature. Although there is a process of gradual elevation, if one, by the association of pure devotees, takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, that is the best way. And that is recommended in this chapter. To achieve success in this way, one must first find the proper spiritual master and receive training under his direction. Then one can achieve faith in the Supreme. When that faith matures, in course of time, it is called love of God. This love is the ultimate goal of the living entities.

In this way he has strange and wonderful adventures, some of which are terrible and frightening.

So-called opposites, such as light and darkness, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;are poles or aspects of the same thing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; But we have no word for that thing, save such vague concepts as Existence, Being, God, or the Ultimate Ground of Being. We really feel that this world is indeed an assemblage of separate things that have somehow come together or, perhaps, fallen apart, and that we are each only one of them. In other words, we do not play the Game of Black-and-White. Instead, we play the game of Black-versus-White or, more usually, White-versus Black. Not realizing the inseparability of the positive and negative poles of the rhythm. Now you can begin to see the world as it is. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;And you don&amp;#39;t see any past, and you don&amp;#39;t see any future. You don&amp;#39;t see a difference between yourself and the rest of it. We find that we live in a eternal now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=\"https://the-eye.eu/public/Psychedelics/Psychedelic%20Praxis%20Library%203.0/Collections%20by%20Author/Alan%20Watts/1966%20-%20Alan%20Watts%20-%20The%20Book%20On%20Taboo%20of%20Knowing%20Who%20You%20Are.pdf\"&gt;Alan Watts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Salt is a simple Here, and yet a manifold. This thing is therefore white only in so far as it is brought in contact with our eye, also sharp to our tongue, also cubic to our touch, etc. The entire diversity of these sides we do not receive from the thing, but from ourselves. Thus they (the sides) fall asunder on our senses (tongue, eyes, etc., which are separate from each other). &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are therefore the universal medium in which such moments isolate themselves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and are for and by themselves. But these different sides which consciousness takes upon itself are determined each for itself, as it is found in the universal medium; the White is merely in opposition to the Black, etc., and the thing is One precisely through the fact that it opposes itself to others. But it does not exclude others from itself through being One, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;for to be One is the universal relation to itself, and from the fact that it is One it is rather like to all&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;; but it excludes through its determinateness. - Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, &lt;a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/jstor-25665651/25665651_djvu.txt\"&gt;The Phenomenology of Spirit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;God also likes to play hide-and-seek, but because there is nothing outside God, he has no one but himself to play with. But he gets over this difficulty by pretending that he is not himself. This is his way of hiding from himself. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;He pretends that he is you and I and all the people in the world&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, all the animals, all the plants, all the rocks, and all the stars. In this way he has strange and wonderful adventures, some of which are terrible and frightening. But these are just like bad dreams, for when he wakes up they will disappear. &amp;quot;Now when God plays hide and pretends that he is you and I, he does it so well that it takes him a long time to remember where and how he hid himself. But that&amp;#39;s the whole fun of it--just what he wanted to do. He doesn&amp;#39;t want to find himself too quickly, for that would spoil the game. That is why it is so difficult for you and me to find out that we are God in disguise, pretending not to be himself. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But when the game has gone on long enough, all of us will wake up, stop pretending, and remember that we are all one single Self&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;--the God who is all that there is and who lives for ever and ever. Furthermore, on seeing through the illusion of the ego, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;it is impossible to think of oneself as better than, or superior to, others&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In every direction there is just the one Self playing its myriad games of hide-and-seek.&amp;quot; - &lt;a href=\"https://the-eye.eu/public/Psychedelics/Psychedelic%20Praxis%20Library%203.0/Collections%20by%20Author/Alan%20Watts/1966%20-%20Alan%20Watts%20-%20The%20Book%20On%20Taboo%20of%20Knowing%20Who%20You%20Are.pdf\"&gt;Alan Watts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The story is about the main character, who is &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; (in second person), and God, who is &amp;quot;me&amp;quot; (in first person). &amp;quot;You&amp;quot;, a 48-year-old man who dies in a car crash, meets the narrator, who says that &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; have been reincarnated many times before, and that &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; are next to be reincarnated as a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD. God then explains that &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; are, in fact constantly reincarnated across time, and that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;all human beings who have ever lived and will ever live are incarnations of &amp;quot;you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; God explains that in fact there are other Godlike beings elsewhere, and that &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; too will one day become a God. The entire universe was created as an egg for the main character (all of humanity), and once &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; have lived every human life ever, &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; will be born as a God. The reason God created the universe was for the main character, &amp;quot;you,&amp;quot; to understand this point: &amp;quot;Every time you victimized someone...you were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you\u2019ve done, you\u2019ve done to yourself. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; - The Egg by Andy Weir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have found that what is written in the Bible can be found in many books. As long as you divide them based on political parties, skin color, you name it, then you suppress the full capacities of your enemies. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come Together. And this entire shit story seizes to exist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;#39;s how fast it could happen. - &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/xC62iJ_oXDE?t=1830\"&gt;Dutch Banker Ronald

I got a tarot reading done recently and became enlightened to the fact that I have a lot of inner child healing I must do, due to attending a very conservative Christian school from the age of 5 through 18. I believe I\u2019ve internalized the idea that I am not worthy of love and this have a lot of difficulty truly loving myself (after all, they did aggressively tell me for my entire life that I am not worthy of love or forgiveness but Jesus will accept me anyway if I confess that I\u2019m horribly unworthy and believe in him). \n\nI\u2019m searching for suggestions on how to begin down this path of healing, as I feel a bit stuck! \n\nNow, about the sexuality aspect of it: I recently had a very brief but very intense connection with someone, and we shared a strong Dom/sub dynamic. I\u2019m now pretty sure that I ventured into what\u2019s called little space, a space of emotional regression, and I think this may very well be linked to the healing that my inner child needs. I think if our relationship had continued, our dynamic would have continued to grow and evolve into a daddy dom/little girl dynamic (but without the explicit ageplay, that doesn\u2019t interest me). I\u2019m aware this may not be the place to find these specific answers, but figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt to put my feelers out and see if anyone here might have some insight.", "send_replies": true,

chapters. The Eighteenth Chapter is a supplementary summarization of the topics discussed before. In every chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stresses that devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life. This same point is summarized in the Eighteenth Chapter as the most confidential path of knowledge. In the first six chapters, stress was given to devotional service: yogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101m... \"Of all yog\u012bs or transcendentalists, one who always thinks of Me within himself is best.\" In the next six chapters, pure devotional service and its nature and activity were discussed. In the third six chapters, knowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and transcendental nature, and devotional service were described. It was concluded that all acts should be performed in conjunction with the Supreme Lord, summarized by the words om tat sat, which indicate Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Person. In the third part of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, devotional service was established by the example of past\u0101c\u0101ryas and the Brahma-s\u016btra, the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, which cites that devotional service is the ultimate purpose of life and nothing else. Certain impersonalists consider themselves monopolizers of the knowledge of Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, but actually the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra is meant for understanding devotional service, for the Lord Himself is the composer of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, and He is its knower. That is described in the Fifteenth Chapter. In every scripture, every Veda, devotional service is the objective. That is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\n\n.\n\nAs in the Second Chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was described, similarly, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all instruction is given. The purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and attainment of the transcendental position above the three material modes of nature. Arjuna wants to clarify the two distinct subject matters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, namely renunciation (ty\u0101ga) and the renounced order of life (sanny\u0101sa). Thus he is asking the meaning of these two words.\n\n.\n\nTwo words used in this verse to address the Supreme Lord-H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba and Ke\u015binis\u016bdana-are significant. H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the master of all senses, who can always help us attain mental serenity. Arjuna requests Him to summarize everything in such a way that he can remain equiposed. Yet he has some doubts, and doubts are always compared to demons. He therefore addresses K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Ke\u015binis\u016bdana. Ke\u015b\u012b was a most formidable demon who was killed by the Lord; now Arjuna is expecting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to kill the demon of doubt.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1: What does the first,second and third part of the Bhagavad-Gita summarize ?**\n\n**.**\n\n**Question 2 : Why the words H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba and Ke\u015binis\u016bdana-are significant ?**\n\n.\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/1](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/1)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53985, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 18.1", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567063382, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cwhdza/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_181/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tesum123", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_15fmwj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566973307, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cwgvjw/from_my_daily_devotion_loved_the_message_and/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cwgvjw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cwgvjw/from_my_daily_devotion_loved_the_message_and/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566973308, "score": 0, "selftext": "When you become a Christian you discover that part of you wants to walk \u2018in newness of life\u2019 (Romans 6:4 KJV), while another part wants to walk \u2018after the flesh\u2019 (Romans 8:5 KJV).

The Bible says, \u2018He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ\u2019 (Philippians 1:6 KJV).

Of course last chapter the trolls attacked my character because I mention evil doctors prodding me. You can read my last book to further explore that issue. I get a disability support pension from the government. I have been in and out of jails and a prison, all for advocating my human rights publicly. I have been imprisoned in their mental health units for over a year of my life. I have had a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizotypal personality disorder. I currently have no diagnosis from any doctor but do take daily medicine and have monthly contact with my awesome doctor.\n\nI am studying full-time both in Community Services and Community Development and in Kabbalah. I get really passionate sometimes and write a lot. But my writings don't come without a lifetime of study behind it. As a child I didn't fit in and I couldn't sleep. So I studied with my time. I studied a lot. And I studied so much that I stopped reflecting the values of common society. I became a Jesus Freak, but found myself challenging the dogmatic doctrines it preached. For I was more interested in the words of Jesus than the words of Homer Simpson or Homer. But I found people placing words in the mouth of Jesus. It felt uncomfortable so I started to question. So even at a young age, I included philosophy in my list of books I enjoyed. Ayn Rand really got me into philosophy and she inspired me to become a better person. But she had many unresolved issues with the ego in her books. Despite this, she introduced me to a new type of fiction as well as to some very heavy concepts at a very young age.\n\nMy sleep has always been a problem. I struggle to fall asleep at night. Some nights I could lay there the entire night without getting any sleep. Going to school the day after one of these sleepless nights is always difficult. Going to work after one of these sleepless nights is always difficult. Many years later, I am prescribed light sleeping medications to help me sleep at night. But if I take them regularly my body gets used to them so I still will have the occasional sleepless night or three.\n\nI graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy from Murdoch University in the beginning of 2018. I have two diplomas (programming, computing) and many certificates from all walks of life. My background is in Information Technology, however, fled the field due to the abuse that clients gave me and that was not fair. I was just trying to help. And you can't expect every technician to be able to fix 100% of cases. You can't fix all the cases, it isn't possible. At some point you just have to give up and say that it is better to replace the equipment. That makes sense! But clients never want to do that but want you to work for next to nothing to resolve their issue. But it must be quoted! You can't have your cake and eat it too. After I finished Year 12, I continued studying and never stopped. I still obsessively study to this day. I have the best teachers on the Internet from Tel Aviv for my Kabbalah studies. I have a really fun life and am never bored even though I don't watch mainstream entertainment. I have done a wide variety of jobs including mobile security guard and I have studied martial arts for approximately 18 years of my life. I obtained two black belts and taught for around four years.\n\nI was married for seven years, with her for ten. I failed to provide her what she needed and she thus left me. After she left me, I donated all of my belongings and travelled back to the USA for almost a year. But I was not warmly welcomed by my family, so I fled back to Australia, but before I left, one of my family members decided to steal all of my money off of me. So when I landed back in Australia, I was homeless and poor. The next five years I travelled all around Australia while homeless, usually living on the tops of mountains or in dense bush settings. I then went to see my father in Florida and he found an online girlfriend in Mexico so he moved there and I followed and I spent the next year in Mexico City teaching English. I moved back to Canberra, starting studying community work, and here we are now. I have written three books in total, this is my fourth.\n\nI also want to point out that this sickness with society against me happens only on the Internet. People around me love me because I am awesome. They are not usually that interested in my work, but I don't care. I make friends everywhere and always struggle to remember people's names because I have met so many people in my life throughout all of my adventures. But people often comment how well I remember names, so maybe the problem is in my head.\n\nI do not hear voices or see things that are not there. I recommend that before anyone comments negatively to my work, that they at least go through my website and understand the magnitude of work that I have backing me. I am obsessed with open source free education. I am director and professor at Open Source University. If you have any questions about Open Source University, you should read the About page on my website. Open Source University has been my baby project since 2012. I had a revelation December 31, 2011 to January 1. Yes, this was an acid trip. I have been shaping it since then to literally be a comprehensive education if your interests lie in philosophy, sociology, and psychology and their technological relevance to today's society. It is a library of original information and are my toils for a life spent studying. I give them to you for free, and I run no advertisement service.\n\nWhile in Mexico, I got engaged to a girl but it was all wrong and we broke it off. Those are my two strikes with relationships *points to outfield*. Time is all it will take I reckon. Do you know any beautiful girls who would be receptive to my words? I am sure someone does. That is my soulmate. The One who wants to spend the rest of her life filming and writing with me. I am through messing up in life by settling. I will no longer settle. She either has all the qualities I am looking for, or she doesn't. Of course, it would take her time to make her decision. There is an abundance of work before you my dear! Explore! Become an adventurer with me. Everybody should become an adventurer with me. I filmed my adventures while teaching a huge range of topics. I created a teaching method that I encourage you to explore.\n\nAs in real mental problems I have? I struggle to work in work situations where I do not feel is meaningful and compassionate. This is why I chose community as my qualification to attach to my degree. I have sleep problems and I admit, if I am sleepy then my head gets fuzzy. This is always a problem with work because some days I am really sleepy. They don't seem to notice though but I do! My sleep problem causes me significant mental strain when sleep deprived. I suffer from what is known as delayed sleep phase disorder. Look it up. I only suffer if I try to go against what my body wants. If I just sleep when my body tells me to, then I am fine. But that sleep schedule does not always coincide with work hours. Staying up all hours of the the night formed me as a person. Because I couldn't waste my time so I spent it all studying. For Satan always find some mischief for idle hands. And those idle hands are my trolls.\n\nAs for recreational drugs, I do smoke spice. Spice is the legal smoke that you can get at head shops. It improves my creativity and helps me sleep. I have done LSD and mushrooms before but probably wouldn't do them again. I prefer spice to pot but I do support the legalisation of pot. I have an electronic vapourisor which has nicotine in it that I use. But in telling you the recreational drugs I currently use and have used doesn't necessitate that I will still be using those drugs in the future.   For instance, I am cutting down the spice and seriously considering quitting because it costs a lot. And I hope to quit vapourising nicotine at some point.\n\nWhy would people attack my character on the Internet merely because I am sharing free content that they do not have to spend their time invested into? I am not forcing my content on anyone. If it is not for you, then move along. Don't contribute to the sickness of our Internet world by littering it with hurtful comments. Instead plant flowers of kindness and joy and you will inspire others to do the same. Let's beautify our Internet by becoming beautiful people to each other on the Internet. If what I am saying is recognised publicly for its value, then we will see many beautiful plantations grown on our Internet. When I see this start to happen then I can relax in the knowledge that our species will be okay. Because it isn't my job to inspire you to live your life. It is my job to inspire you to inspire others to inspire others to live their lives. This is the only way that we can truly live. It is time we hold hands and create an Internet chain. How long can we make this chain? To my haters: I have the rest of my life to make this happen. How many hours in the day..night?\n\nhttp://nesmith.net/atheden", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53892, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Testimony", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567034520, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cwcdqn/my_testimony/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Katietennyson", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5f69gt9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566947887, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cwcbrf/the_spiral/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cwcbrf", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cwcbrf/the_spiral/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566947888, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53892, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The spiral", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567034273, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cwcbrf/the_spiral/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Katietennyson", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5f69gt9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566947779, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cwcax4/what_made_you_spiritual/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cwcax4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cwcax4/what_made_you_spiritual/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566947780, "score": 2, "selftext": "For me it was when my dad got cancer, I became more spiritual.

My boyfriend whisked me away on a surprise camping trip for the night and we pitched our tent in a cave high up so we were really at one with nature and away from all people. We were dipping in and out of entrancement with the campfire the entire evening and this meant our trail of conversation also dipped off, not that this matters though as we can comfortably sit in silence together. We did smoke a bit of weed together, and as I watched the many stars in the sky start to sparkle brighter and the relaxation cemented itself deeper within me I was talking to him but in my own head. I talked about our future plans; children, marriage, houses. I visualised my life with him and many fun daily activities and the absolute joy I feel to be loved by him. I really went on a journey with this self-contained conversation in my mind. I continued to gaze into the fire and I felt myself \u201cblend\u201d more and more with the cool cave walls, the trees, and gorgeous night sky. I felt very emotional at this point and eternally grateful for what I was experiencing at that moment.\n\nThen, we both twitched slightly, \u201ccoming back into the room\u201d as you would say. I\u2019m not sure how long this period of silence had lasted. I said \u201cdid you feel that?\u201d He was just beaming at me. He\u2019d understood every damn word I said and I didn\u2019t have to move my lips. He said it must have been telepathy, he heard me talking about future kids, and all the other things I was saying in my own head - I was positive he was listening to me, though. The bond we already had has doubled in strength, and the next day intimate emotions/feelings felt phenomenal like no other connection or power I\u2019ve ever felt within my body intertwined with another person\u2019s before.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53871, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I experienced something amazing this weekend", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567026520, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cwam0y/i_experienced_something_amazing_this_weekend/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Discreet_Troll", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_32g9fsir", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566939805, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cwajao/reflecting_on_previous_posts_again/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cwajao", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cwajao/reflecting_on_previous_posts_again/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566939807, "score": 1, "selftext": "I had mentioned some sensitive things over the last weekend that were bothering me.

I get into these sad mental stories about not getting attention, affection, respect, noticed. But none of those words sound quite right\u2026 I will think of it later. We went to the local restaurant to treat the police officers today, though I didn't do much of anything. I did get the email out to SOTA and the colloidal silver web page done. But I just sat off to the side at the other table. I kept thinking I should join them, but I couldn't. It was like a mental barrier or wall, blocking me from getting up. Kept me from doing anything really. Overwhelmed by anxiety and confusion.\n\nMy mind kept me back. It kept explaining the situation as I was not apart of the group. I am not one of them. (the group I am working with) I isolate myself\u2026 I distance myself. I don't belong here. I had to go for a walk and tried to hang out by the lake to think over things or calm down. Did Not help. Or, rather, I wouldn't allow it to help. My mind wanted to keep this self deprecating story going, if not just for the satisfaction raught from justifiably believing that I am not good enough. I have nothing to offer the world. From this then comes the \u201cno point in living\u201d thoughts. The hatred for life itself thoughts. This cosmic joke of nonsensical bullshit made manifest for your viewing pleasure, kind of mentality...\n\nBut from this also comes something of a realization of momentary truth for myself. I fucking hate people (I tell myself). I don't want to help anyone. I don't even know why I am here, with this group, helping people. The people are a bother to me and I don't want anything to do with them. This is what I tell myself at least. But all these things fill me with doubt as to my place in life.\n\nAnd, on top of these thoughts, are the unsettling realization that I am losing my blood family the longer I stay invisible. The realization that there is no back to go back too. That I have no more home. This is a rather somber feeling. What have I done with my life? What happened? All these new and insane and beautiful things, so rare and magical, transformative and world altering. These things that life happened upon me, and, seemingly, very few others\u2026 What has it done to me? Was it worth it? What happens now? How do I move forward? Where does this end? \n\nI don't know\u2026\n\nAll I see here is meaningless.\n\nI have to change. I can alter my future. I can change who I am now. I have that power, but do I have the will? I no longer need to remain attached to the me I have always thought myself to be. I am allowed to be who I need to be to get to where I want to go\u2026 I am the creator of my own life. I am the identity itself, in constant recreation. Endowed with freedom of choice and the power of free will, to make the best of this journey, flowing through this part of the river of infinity, choosing to steer clear the whirlpools of negative thinking.\n\nThis leads me to the point. My question of, \u201cwhy am I, someone who doesn't care about anybody, here trying to help everybody?\u201d Well, of course, it would be the best exercise to strengthen ones will power. Here I am, no family to return home to, and yet amazing possibilities lie here. Although, those possibilities are only found and realized through my transmutation. I have to reprogram myself to find joy in helping my fellow man. \n\nSlingshot myself from one extreme, to the other?\n\n...That actually applies to other parts of my life now as well\u2026 One extreme, to the other. But I guess I just haven't learned that lesson yet. The lesson of choice. Life is an exercise of will. Despite what your brain screams at you about what it thinks or interprets is going on around you, how well can you maintain yourself? Upon knowing you can control your emotions, applying the will to maintain the optimal emotions for your enjoyment and heightened success in every situation. Having the rational to see if an emotion is benefiting you or not and, if not, than changing it to one that is.\n\nYou are above the mind, in fact, you are what makes up the mind. The mind as you understand it, is only an accumulation and categorization of events, experiences and knowledge gained from birth until now. It is a programmed response system. The autonomic nervous system. It can be reprogrammed! With effort and will, it can be reprogrammed. \n\nYou can change who you are, you can alter your fate.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53863, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Thoughts influencing how we interact with our reality.

No one listens to angry and conceited individuals that are highly critical of other people. This is because all human beings are by nature competitive, and all of us know this inside. No one trusts a \u201cjudger\u201d.\n\nJudgmental people are very competitive (which is all of us), and they do not want to give up authority and anger (which is many of us). If we are unfriendly, we are not actually looking for significant changes on the planet, we just think we are. This is because all of us have emotional pain over the human experience. Out of pride, most of us try to hide our pain from other people, which is not possible. Our emotional pain is not always conscious, but it often is, and when it is, we are openly lying to people in society about our true motivations in life. This is complete honesty.\n\nAll human beings are angry because there are too many of us that refuse to be self-reflective and honest with how competitive we often are, and how we treat other people.\n\nWhile it may be true that some people are less aware and less compassionate in life towards other people, the environment, and animals, we are all here to grow. Growth never stops in life. For any of us. All of us are in emotional pain because we see human behavior we do not like, and we want to control it some how. The issue is that the more we try to control other people, the less self control we have in our lives.\n\nNo one is in authority on the planet, and people that seek it out, never make the changes that they seek on the planet. Other people will make significant changes on Earth with love, honesty, and friendships, however.\n\nAll of us have to show restraint when other people do not care as much as we do about a specific problem in society. When we show restraint of judgment of other people, we are concerned primarily with our own emotional growth, and our own attitudes, and not the growth and attitudes of other people.\n\nWe all have to see how our lack of love and honesty impact other people on the planet, and WHY problems persist and seem to not go away. It is because human beings are by nature competitive, elitist, classist, and competitive, and they don\u2019t want to admit it.\n\nWe always expect other people to judge us, not because there is something actually wrong with us, but BECAUSE all of us are competitive and we see it in other people. It's time to get real about it so we can solve the crisis we see on Mother Earth: human authority, arrogance, elitism, and a lack of compassion.\n\nIf human beings are not honest about how much we compete and how dishonest we are with other people, we will NEVER save the planet, and we will never save ourselves or the animals right along with it.\n\nAll people trust genuine, friendly, down-to-Earth human beings that stay out of fights. The only power we have is to love and to remain hopeful that things will improve.\n\nWe really have no control. The only control we have is to BE FRIENDS here. That is it, and if we are not honest, we will never heal.  \n\nWhat can I do to make a difference here? How can I set the example?

I dont like saying that im depressed or anything because well, i dont know what depression really is. But if the words to describe it were \u201creally fucking sad\u201d then thats me. I blame my overthinking mind for how i feel. I overthink too much. Thats not the only thing though. So much shit is just going on right now. Im constantly being picked on, and i dont know if I deserve it or not. I feel like playing the victim is a pussy move. Im no angel either. I guess i have a loud mouth too. I dont mean to cause harm, I truly dont. Its just, laughing and joking around give me the surge of happiness that i need to get through the day. But, i guess others would see that as being immature. And maybe i really am just immature. Maybe thats why nobody likes me. And like, im not saying this just to seem edgy or anything, but i really feel like nobody fucks with me like how id like them to. I see all these people with friends and stuff. Laughing together, doing stupid shit together, cracking jokes, doing shit together. I want to be that cool with people. I don\u2019t know. Im not going to lie, i value status too much. I try not to, i really do. But every day i just cant stop questioning; why cant i be like them?\nActually , i dont even care about friends. I want respect and i dont know how to get it. Ive been in this school for 4 years now and barley nobody gives me respect unless i beat somebody\u2019s ass. I guess it\u2019s because im little and an easy target i suppose. But that doesnt even make sense because i see people my height get respect by the same 6ft fat niggas that love to hit me and shit. And i dont want to go around and just pick fights with everybody. Im insecure. I hate to admit it but i am. Thats why every little thing bothers me. My forehead, my height, my body, personality, all of that. Anybody mentioning those things just makes me want to cry. But i always hold the tears in because the last thing i need is to look vulnerable. I wish i could stand up for myself more but i cant even do that. If someone says or does anything to me i just sit there. Like a pussy bitch. Im a pussy bitch. I really wish i could be that man that doesnt back down for nothing but im just too afraid of confrontation. I dont want it to be like that though. Im scared either im going to get my ass beat or that ill end up killing the person. Because i do feel like stabbing people with scissors sometimes. To be honest only thing holding me back is the consequences. I think i might be bipolar too. I think thats what my therapist was going to diagnose me with but he died. He was help, but not a lot of help. I still have a lot of things wrong with me. I like to compensate my insecurities with girls though. I dont know. Its like, i dont even really feel with most of these women either. Im just always on a constant chase. Like, im not going to lie. My exes did me dirty, but i did my dirt as well. I always wondered why my dad was such a hoe before he was sent to prison. Now i know. Its like, ok for instance. My first girlfriend. At first i loved her, but obviously she wasnt ready for a relationship. Then as time went by, i got bored of her and started wanting the attention of my own best female friend. Eventually i fucked my current girlfriend out of lust then left her in the dust for my best friend. Dont worry though, karma bite me in the ass lol. My best friend ended up cheating on me outright. I always wondered what i did to deserve it but i forgot that im really just a piece of shit so i got what i had coming. To be honest if she wouldve stuck around I would\u2019ve probably ended up chasing some other girl too. I got me another girl afterwards, cheated on her. Then i got another girl, cheated on her ass well. I just cant stay loyal for shit. Maybe at first i can, but after the honeymoon phase dies down im a squirrel looking for another nut. I just love the trill of chasing and getting women. Im almost too obsessed with it. So maybe i do deserve having depression. And having depression makes me angry. And being angry makes me want to die. But see, heres the kicker! While I desperately do want to die, (seriously i do. Like I literally pray to god to kill me everyday) i refuse to kill myself and i dont think i ever will either. But i do want to die. Badly. I started playing on my high school football team because i figured well, i might as well play that and hopefully im good enough to where someone knocks the living hell out of me and kills me. I deserve to get hurt anyway lol. But nope turns out im ass at football, nobody will help me, and im getting bullied even more for playing it. Now im stuck between if i want to quit or keep playing. Such a shame because football was the only thing that really got me excited for school. I got no real friends here, im constantly getting picked on, oh and dont get me started on the school work! See ive always been a lazy son of a bitch. Never had the determination to do work in school. Never was the type. I know i got to do it, buttt i mean thinking on it now not really. Like i just dont care enough. I see it as this, i know for sure im not going to no expensive ass long ass college. Im going to community at best. But even thats just for backup. For my dream, i want to blow up with music. Not even blow up, but music is my passion. I want to either do that or entrepreneurship. If i end up not doing either and being stuck at a job i dont like im better off dead to be honest. Now you must be thinking, well, why dont i tell anybody about this stuff? Well see, i really dont trust anybody and everytime i seek and get help i always fall back down into the hole. To be honest i feel like the only one that can truly help me is, well me. My therapist (rip \u2764\ufe0f) while he did try to help, he didnt really help much. And i went to him for almost 3 years too. My mom isnt much help either. She doesn\u2019t understand and she\u2019s honestly a cause for a lot of my stress as well. I really dont like her. I believe something out there is going to help me eventually get through this. If not, to he honest i dont care about being sad as long as i can do something you know? Like i besides those two career options, i really want to help people that are like me. Confused, people that are just in the struggle. I look up to a certain person like that, xxxtentacion. Might sound a bit cringy, but dude\u2019s life sucked ass, he suffered with a lot of mental problems yet he pulled through just to make people happy and to help people. And he did, he sorta opened my eyes. I consider myself a spiritual person, i guess. Im not really religious, but I believe in god, i believe in spirits, I believe in purpose.

The question is: Can we heal ourselves? And if so, how? \n\n\"It depends on what kind of sufferings they are. Sufferings, like everything else, can be of three kinds. In this case they can be physical (tama), mental (raja) or spiritual. Of course all these levels are greatly interrelated to one another. However, in a limited sense, you can separate them from one another.\n\nPhysical suffering occurs because of the blockages of the energy in the body. This becomes more profound if the body is toxic. Fasting, meditation and a balanced diet greatly helps the cure of the body.\n\nMental sufferings are related to the unbalances between the psychic centers (chakras). They also occur because of the social pressures. A harmonious environment, good rest, meditation, fasting, prayer, etc, will greatly help. They all will be provided in the Communities of Light.\n\nSpiritual suffering, of course, is the worst. Indeed other sufferings have a spiritual cause. The cause of spiritual suffering is the feeling of being separate from God. This will result in feeling lonely, powerless, and vulnerable. He who feels that God is not with him is vulnerable and is at the mercy of the troubles and problems of the world. He who is above all these trivialities has no problems and experiences no sufferings.\n\nThis is the way you can cure your \"present sufferings!\"\"\n\n(from Golden Keys V by Maitreya)\n\n\nFor those who are suffering spiritually and feel that God is not close to you, you have only to close your eyes and enter the temple of your body to be with God, who is already there. God is within you. As He says, \"Be still and know that I am God.\" or \"Know thyself to know God\"\n\nYour very essence is God and the illusion of separation from God is caused by the ego/devil/tama guna. Closing your eyes and closing off your senses, whether through prayer or meditation(both are best) is the best way to dissolve the ego and loosen this crudying force(tama guna). \n\nMeditation, diet, reading Scripture, prayer,  excersize, yoga, fresh air, sunshine, Etc. --and also having a sentient environment to live, and watching the things you watch and see, and having the will to improve, are all the tools that you can use to heal yourself.\n\n\nSal-Om!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53836, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do we have the power to heal ourselves?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567012972, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cw7k6q/do_we_have_the_power_to_heal_ourselves/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "imthatlostcat", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4f894d90", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566924896, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cw76l6/during_meditation/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cw76l6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 44, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cw76l6/during_meditation/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566924897, "score": 120, "selftext": "I experienced a great and scary thing. \n\nI became, for a moment, infinite consciousness.\n\nI became everything there is.\n\nI was very alone and the feeling of being TOTALLY alone is what snapped me out of it.

Therefore, in this verse, it is declared that such activities are abominable. Everything should be done for the Supreme in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Without such faith, and without the proper guidance, there can never be any fruit. In all the Vedic scriptures, faith in the Supreme is advised. In the pursuit of all Vedic instructions, the ultimate goal is the understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. No one can obtain success without following this principle. Therefore, the best course is to work from the very beginning in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. That is the way to make everything successful.\n\n.\n\nIn the conditional state, people are attracted to worship demigods, ghosts, or Yak\u1e63as like Kuvera. The mode of goodness is better than the modes of passion and ignorance, but one who takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is transcendental to all three modes of material nature. Although there is a process of gradual elevation, if one, by the association of pure devotees, takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, that is the best way. And that is recommended in this chapter. To achieve success in this way, one must first find the proper spiritual master and receive training under his direction. Then one can achieve faith in the Supreme. When that faith matures, in course of time, it is called love of God. This love is the ultimate goal of the living entities. One should, therefore, take to Kr\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness directly. That is the message of this Seventeenth Chapter.\n\n.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventeenth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of the Divisions of Faith.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the ultimate goal of the living entities?

It was hilarious to see the social media response on Shinigami. The idiots did EXACTLY what I advised that they would do which resulted in what I said would happen in the chapter: the loss of their soul. Some responded with anger and most just laughed. They can have the laugh now, because I get the last laugh. \n\nPeople tell me that I am schizophrenic and to get help or take my meds or something along that nature. Even the idiot psychiatrists are like this. But here is the thing: I am happier than everyone else in this world. You all mope around like sad sacks complaining about life and I am flying around everywhere laughing and smiling. I have never met a person as happy as I am. And if I am happy then why do I need medications? Why does the general public want me locked up so much? They push their sadness on to you and claim you to be the sick one when they are the ones who are depressed. But duhh, you are happy so that must mean you are sick. Can you see how the sickness tries to push itself on others?\n\nI have never met an atheist who possessed a solid moral framework. Atheist account for most of my haters. And if they are atheist, then why are they spending their time with my work, which is all about God? Because most trolls on the Internet are atheist. Atheism is the greatest sickness a human can have. The works of atheists are more counterproductive than the works of Satanists. Satanists have a stronger moral foundation than atheists do. This means that atheists are actually worse for our world than Satanists. At least within Satanism, they acknowledge the divine, profane, and spirit. Atheism rejects all possibilities for a God. And as a result, God rejects all possibilities with them. The main destructive force in our society is not led by secret societies or djinn worshippers. The Devil's greatest trick was convincing people that he does not exist. And God's greatest trick was letting the Devil convince others that they both don't exist. And my greatest trick was telling people what they would do and what I would do as a result of what they would do and then them doing it despite me warning them that they were going to do it.\n\nCan you start to see how hilarious this all is? I know souls are a very real thing and reaping them is no laughing matter. But after the reap, they have no soul, so laugh at their stupidity. After the reap do not invest any more time into them. Just ring up the transaction and put it through. Do not argue with fools, for you can never win. They are not worth the effort. They don't want their wounds healed. They just want to inflict wounds on others to bring them down to their level. Don't pursue their bait, for if you do, you will become their dinner.\n\nA lot of what I was being abused about in chapter 6 was because I mentioned Jesus. In most circles, Jesus is a toxic name. Because Christians took the man and called him God. In a monotheistic religion, there is only one God. Yet somehow Christians divide God into three, which makes no logical sense. This is where the Devil steps in and turns God's son into God. This is in direct defiance of the previous Old Testament God, Yahweh. The Devil stepped into the shoes of Jesus (the man) and demanded worship. As a result, churches can oftentimes spend an entire sermon without even saying the word, \"God\". For they pray to Jesus and claim him as God. As a result, God = Jesus, we can just say Jesus now because it is too hard to say God but so easy to just say Jesus (Lucifer).\n\nSaul of Tarsus was a persecutor of all who followed Jesus. He even killed the followers of Jesus. But one day, a very bright light blinded Saul for three days. Lucifer means to bring the light. Saul was reborn in fire which allowed him to switch sides, now renamed to Paul. In disguise, he corrupts the message of Jesus by claiming a revelation: Jesus is God. He then continues by building up the new Jesus movement churches, and in effect, creates Christianity. And then we forget that Jesus was a Jew or like to think that Jesus was a Christian. But that makes no sense. Jesus never claimed to be God. It was the fruitful works of Saul that made that happen. And in effect, and very secretly and mostly unknowingly, Christians actually serve Satan. For modern day orthodox Christianity is actually Satanism in different clothes. For they have given up on trying to save this world and only want the next. Their works are in vain as their foundations were corrupted. They say their Bible is written by God and is therefore without error. How does this make any sense? It was written by individuals who were inspired by God. I am sure there are a few errors in my work. Humans are fallible creatures and no matter what we make, we can never be free of error. However, the more you learn, the less errors you will make. And I am sure that all of my investigations are not 100% accurate, for I can only account for what I knew at the time. Because we can only account for our currently held understandings. If I did not know something until after I wrote an article, then that new information cannot be accounted for in the article. To write like I can takes a great deal of training. I have been writing since childhood.\n\nIn time as these new understandings are comprehended, the world will convert to Islam. BUT WAIT Wendell, what are you saying? The entire world will convert to Islam: not the religion but its meaning. Islam means to fully dedicated oneself to God. And this will be the extent of our collective religion. Because in time we will learn beyond a shadow of a doubt of the existence of God. Proof as to God's existence will be discovered and it would be illogical to not fully dedicate yourself to God. We will learn from all forms of wisdom and discover how to decipher truth from falsehood and even falsehood found hidden in truths, like any religion.\n\nThe idiots of this world are my entertainment. The entertainment for the idiots of this world is to watch mainstream television. The entertainment for the rich are owning mainstream television and as a result, brainwashing the populace. The entertainment for demons is to own the souls of the rich. And the entertainment for God is to watch His creation both fail and succeed at avoiding evil. But in the end, God is my entertainment. For my eyes are looking upwards and seeing the ripples, waves, and finally, ships (God).\n\nIf you make a really stupid decision that I literally just warned you about, then who is at fault? Is it my fault that you didn't value your soul enough to not do exactly what I told you that you are going to do? I can determine character very quickly based upon the language individuals utilise. Someone who is inexperienced in martial arts will choreograph their movements, meaning that we can easily predict their movements based upon their body positioning and momentum. This is why people that don't know martial arts are really easy to physically dominate. Experienced movements can easily dominate inexperienced movements. This is how I can easily assess character, oftentimes with only receiving a small amount of information about the person. I can see their movements miles away. And it is unlikely that your haters will read your work. They will just troll without understanding that this time, I made a trap for trolls. And as a result, exactly what I predicted will play out in the world.\n\nMy life is amazingly awesome. I love my life very much and I want you to have as much fun as I do in life. My name means adventurer and that is exactly what I am. I have had more adventures than anyone I have met before. And how do you want to live life? If you are depressed in this life then I am trying to show you how to permanently destroy that depression and instead instill happiness and joy. Because when you can see what I see, depression becomes nonsensical. If depressing matters no longer depress us, then we have found enlightenment. And I found that enlightenment years ago and have worked very hard to now bring it to you. And here it is to you for free. And why? Because I love you. Do not concern yourself with human love. For it is destructive and not true Love. Only concern yourself with Divine Love, for it has no conditions and bestows as a matter of fact. I love you and I do not even know you. You honour a writer when you immerse yourself into their work. Thank you for reading this and I encourage you to check out my other works at nesmith . net.

I wonder how high I can rise upon these solid foundations. I am a lifetime student and I am obsessed with learning. If yesterday's work was The Meaning of Life, today's work Atheden, and tomorrow's... This is what I have made myself. What have you made yourself? Don't worry, you have the rest of your life to complete the project. Now what can your life become because you stumbled upon me? Enjoy my love to give. For this Love is your new home.

It's hard to quickly explain\n\n\nSo... I was walking down a road in my childhood neighborhood, and my family and grandparents (maybe not my grandparents) were there. We were going to a happy place, like a vacation, but it was a little different, it felt permanent once I got there. It's like when you're a kid and you are going to Disney Land/World, except none of the stress lol.\n\nWhen we got to the end of the road, I found out that my brother was going away, for either a long time, or for good, to a different, almost \"higher\" place. He was going to a better place to live the rest of his life (like when your family member goes off to college). I was crying and hugging him like I'd never see him again. But I knew that he was going to fulfill his life so I was happy for him.\n\nAt the end of the road, I saw a silhouette in the sky with a balloon for a head and when it popped I heard people cheer. That was basically the sign that we had arrived.\n\nI left my family, I don't know what they did at the end of the road. \n\nI remember walking down that road, the opposite direction this time, and there was this guy who was telling me, and other people like me, about the things we could do to finish basically, what seemed like, life.\n\nI remember there where so many sections and things to choose, I remember swimming fastly through the sections, I remember only one, it was random, for some reason I had decided to swim around that section for a couple of seconds, not because I chose that for my preference, but just because I wanted to see what it was like, I looked through it like you'd look through a random page of a magazine, knowing you'd have time to explore all pages.\n\nHe was showing us everything, or how to get to everything, but it seemed like there was too much to show. \n\nNext I remember me and the others getting to know eachother better as we looked through areas on these shleves and fridges around the that same road, I remember specifically the fridges, shelves and fridges like ones you'd find in wholesale places\n\nI remember the presence of one of the people, she was a brunette woman (it actually felt like we were teenagers), it was a really positive and pleasant presence, I think I might have been interested in her romantically, but it also felt like we had a really good relationship already. I remember the whole time we (not just me and her) where going through this life/game/whatever, I was enjoying myself so much, we didn't care if we won the game (if that's what it was), I don't really think there were winners, and we didn't care about anything but being invested, enjoyed with, and involved in what we were doing, we were happy, just going through all of the motions, whatever they were, it felt like there were guidelines but it also felt like we were free, we weren't botherd by \"guidelines\", it was like you're playing a fun game or a race (again it was a pleasant thing, even if there was a chance to \"win\", we didn't care about it, we were just havig fun in the moment)\n\nThe next I remember is being in a wholesale environment again, but it looked more like an actual store, I remember seeing a brunette mother with a cart and a baby in it, she looked angry and unpleasant, but then she asked me something and she said it in a really nice way so my opinion immediately changed about her. Then I think she knocked something down.\n\nThen I was with mom walking down that road again, always at night, we were talking, it felt like I had taken a break from that \"life/game\" thing. Like I had come back to visit her. We were talking about something and when I entered the road the silhouette thing happened in the sky again with the balloon, and I forgot that it would happen but I remembered and people cheered and I kind of dissmised it.\n\nI don't really remember much after that, and I'm not sure if this is important but last night my body would just not let me sleep, and time started going faster and faster and it's still seemingly going fast right now.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53756, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I had a wonderful dream, all peace and love.

in the past where, I would feel like my \u201csoul\u201d wanted to come out of my body the crown of my head would have a lot of pressure and I would see lights usually, but I fought it because of fear. Most of them happening because I\u2019m the dream I can to the realization that it wasn\u2019t real and I was in fact in a dream \n\n\nLast night I was sleeping face down on my bed , I could feel this weight on my back and this hands as if someone was holding onto my neck /shoulders pushing me down from getting up. I tried to start by wiggling my fingers and feet slowly and sometimes I would think I was awake but I was just visualizing movement. I felt like I was very drunk /dizzy almost like I was drugged, I would slighting see my eyes opening only for it to shut close by the lack of energy I had. I think I woke up but was so drained I just fell right back asleep \n\nAfterwards I had another dream that had different scenes. I remember a lot of details in it. I was newly working at a shop wore wrong shoes coworkers judged me. Then I\u2019m in a deep blue bedroom water on the floor couple on a bed dog in a floaty across from me, my real life bosses face was there he offered me ice cream we went inside a gym with coworkers (none of them I know in real life except my boss ) is there I see a big guy in the corner staring at a wall like a zombie I go up and tell him \u201cyour like the lonely kid alone in recess\u201d he doesn\u2019t move and inch just stares at the wall continuously. \n\nWeirdest Part: \nSo I go to my \u201cBoss\u201d and tell him about my previous dream were something was holding me down on my neck and I wouldn\u2019t wake up. And he says something alone the lines of \u201c oh I think that\u2019s pretty normal it happens to some people\u201d . So then I try to justify what I said by saying \u201coh yeah I didn\u2019t really think it hurt or anything he wasn\u2019t doing it that hard\u201d .

This experience was the only paranormal experience I've ever had, probably the only one that I will ever have in my life and was one of the two most spiritual/terrifying experiences I have ever had. I already was told and already know what it was and don't need any suggestions of what people \"think it was\". If anyone has had an experience/encounter with something like this please let me know in the comments. I've looked all over the internet and reddit for encounters that were identical to mine or even similar and there are absolutely no encounters like mine. I was told by another reddit user that was from Castaneda's private class and has read all of his books/has been studying his work for many years what I saw was called an \"Inorganic Being\" . I also sent a drawing I did of the \"Inorganic Being\" to a Native on instagram that lives in B.C not to far from me, and he knew what it was right away, told me what the name of the \"Inorganic Being\" was in his Native language and gave me a bit of hints to what it was (that I am not going to share in my post out of respect.)\n With the Natives information and the other information I received about Castaneda, I compared all the details with my experience and that is how I know it was a \"Inorganic Being\". When you compare notes they are all the same, but in different wording.)\n\nTL;DR close to the bottom of post but I suggest you read the whole post though because it is worth it.)\n\nEncounter/experience:\n\nBack in 2010 in British Columbia, Canada approximately in early October or mid October when I was 16 (I am 25 years old now) my old friend lived in the rural part of my city(has a lot of forest area and farm land) His backyard has 5 acres of forest with a few houses surrounded in the distance around the outskirts of the forest. Me and him would go and explore the forest all the time because it was quite mystical and just a cool place to wander. This one time me and my friend went outside to his forest with his dog like we would usually do in the daytime, but this time at night in his backyard forest at about 1 am to go explore and smoke a joint like usual (Which we were sober at the time and did'nt even get to smoking because of encountering the \"Inorganic Being\" and being terrified, we ended up smoking it inside his basement/room).\n\nThere's a steep cliff made out of forest floor when you first walk in. It is only about 10 - 15 feet into the forest area from the \"entrance\" of the forest. When we were standing at the cliff/ravine before the path way leading down to the rest of the forest which was the only safe way to walk down especially at night, I could see a 7-8 feet tall pure white soft figure and it was inbetween two trees moving around softly swaying left to right back and forth between the trees standing (literally touching the forest floor) in the exact same place the whole time we saw it making absolutely no sound and there was absolutely no wind.\n\nI wasn't even going to say anything about the figure to my friend at first because I was waiting for my friend to say something. We observed it for a couple seconds in complete silence and we're \"mesmerized\" by it's movements, then I asked my friend if he saw it and he said yeah he could as well.  We stood silent in fear as we were watching it do its strange unsettling soft swaying movements/trying to adjust our eyes to the Inorganic Being and see what it was doing. As I was in a slight daze watching it sway I started to feel a ominous energy \"set in\" and felt impending doom (the sinking feeling) in my chest area like when you are going to die or are in a life threatening situation and I had shivers going throughout my body. That's when I told my friend specifically \"I don't like this\", he agreed and we left immediately. I wasn't so much scared of the sight of the Inorganic Being, I was more curious about the strange movements it was making and what it really looked like, I was scared of the feeling of death it made me feel. It felt like I was going to literally die, or something really bad was going to happen.\n\nThe \"Inorganic Being\" was just white long limbs seemed to be at least 7 - 8 feet tall from where we were standing which was about 30-40 feet away from us. It was not a trick of the mind or light, there was no light nor moon shining in the forest because it was filled with tall pine trees/other vegetation had various leveling's. It was not a spiderweb or any sort of garbage (we had gone back in the morning daylight and saw nothing out of the ordinary). His forest is pristine condition cause no one ever goes in it, there is no garbage. We got into about 10-15 feet in the forest and were at the top of the ravine standing at a cliff/before the pathway to down (The safe way to get down) and the \"Inorganic Being\" was in between trees down below where we would take the pathway downwards. There were no houses close enough to give off any light or give off a shine through the trees and the Inorganic Being was not see through it looked like it was almost solid, but it was very ghostly/spirit looking as well. It was upside down v shaped and It had no facial features/head at all from what we could see in the dark.\n\nIt was so white it looked like it was almost shining but it wasn't because it was'nt giving of any light of any sort, it was pure white ,looked soft and kind of shiny, it was swaying left to right, right to left with its two really long arms they almost looked like separated curtains swaying in the wind. The best way I can describe it is 7-8 foot ,thin separated curtains, blowing in the wind touching the forest floor, but right and left back and forth in a specific motion with no sound at all, absolutely no wind, dead silent. Its movements were \"Psychedelic\" and sort of \"hypnotizing\". It was soft like Charlies white spirit entering Peters body after the attic scene from \"Hereditary\" Probably the most solid description I can give of what it looked like. It was making no sound at all while it was swaying, it was beautiful to look at and terrifying/unsettling at the same time, that's why it was so astonishing to look at, it was almost angelic. There were absolutely no sounds in the forest, it was dead silent while it was moving back and forth. Its movements could have been a lure of some sort because it did not move towards us or anywhere, or it was just letting us know to stay away because it was scared to death as well or just didn't want us to disturb it. It was literally something you would see in a science fiction horror movie.\n\nWe left very quick because we did'nt know what it was, it scared us and our intuition (my feeling of dread/death) told us it was dangerous. I remember my friend yelling something at it because he could tell his dog was scared , I am entirely positive the dog was whimpering. And the Inorganic Being was just still swaying back and forth left to right between the trees in the same exact same spot. We left quickly because we were terrified and did'nt plan on wanting to even see what it was. Almost immediately after we got out of the forest (left the \"entrance\" of the forest (which we were not far from) it felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders and the feeling of dread left pretty much immediately. I will never forget walking out of the forest that night.\n\nThere is absolutely no animals in Northern British Columbia, Canada or the rest of Canada and U.S that look close to what we saw, there are absolutely no animals that are 7-8 feet tall and stand on 2 legs. It did not have a body( It's 2 legs/limbs were its body) It was not a animal, and there is no possible way to \"debunk\" this. I have explored all the options of what it could have been. This was the first time we ever went out to his forest at night, and it was the last time we ever went in the forest at night.\n\nThe forest is 5 acres of tall pine trees it is quite dense in areas, and quite open in others due to vegetation, just the one area where we saw the Spirit was huge. There is a creek going through the forest close by to where we saw the Spirit at the lowest level of the forest. Around the area of town it is mostly just a couple million dollar houses, and farm/forest area. It is pretty much the greenbelt of my city. He has no neighbors that are close to the location because as I said his forest is 5 acres with the closest neighbors being at least 3 blocks down the street on the right hand side of the forest. To this day the feeling that I had when I saw the Inorganic Being move still gives me shivers. The fact that we went out to the forest at that time really late at night and happened to see that freaks me out as well, cause it was clearly meant to be seen by us. If we went out any later or any sooner we might not have seen it in his forest at that moment of time. Like I said, I didn't have to point out to my friend where the Inorganic Being was he automatically saw it at the same time I saw it. I think the feeling of dread could have possibly have been a warning to keep away from it and that is why me and my friend left right away without any hesitation. It is now 9 years later I am 25 and the experience still scares me.\n\nThis was my only Parnaormal Experience I have ever had. There was no paranormal activity that I experienced when I would go to my friends house or on his property/ in his forest besides the one experience/encounter, but now that I think back on hanging outside there and exploring the woods there is for sure something \"special\" about the whole location.\n\nI understand a lot of people are scared of these types of things and they don't want to believe they exist, but would have had to be there yourself to understand what it looked like, see the creeping movements, and feel what I felt. We have scaled my friends forest including the area where we saw the Inorganic Being at least 20 different times/ different days before hand seeing it and we went back the day after to the exact spot where we saw the Inorganic Being in the forest and noticed nothing out of the ordinary. So we know that it was some sort of \"being\" and it was something we shouldn't have been seeing or attempt to go up to.\n\nHere is my full description of the \"Inorganic Being\", me and my friend saw:\n\n7-8 feet Tall, Pure White (When I mean \"pure white\" I mean Paper, Bone white) Not see-through, Just 2 Pure White Long limbs (from what we could see in the dark). It was so white it looked like it was almost giving off light but it was'nt because it was not shining or illuminating the trees or ground and Im pretty sure you could see shadow on it from it moving back and forth in the same place between the trees, had no facial features from what we could see and it was swaying back and forth around that I can only describe as 7-8 foot separated curtains blowing in the wind touching the forest floor, but right and left back and forth in a specific motion with no sound at all, absolutely no wind, dead silent. Emanated the feeling of dread and impending doom when I started being \"Mesmorized\" by its strange movements. I tried my best to squint my eyes and adjust them to the Inorganic Being/dark better to see what it was doing or if I could make out what it looked like better, but it did not help at all it just still appeared as I described.\n\nTl;DR: Entered my friends backyard 5 acre forest at night close to 1 am and both of us immediately saw something out of place down the path below about 30-40 feet away from us in between the trees that was tall and white. It appeared to be completely white and soft like light, but it did not illuminate the trees or ground around it. There was no face or any facial features we could see, no arms and seemed like it was shaped in a upside down V. It was making creepy swaying movements with its (whole body) two legs left to right back and forth silently still standing on the forest floor in the exact same spot the whole time we saw it. It did not pick up its legs or walk at all. I can only explain it as looking like 7-8 foot really white, soft, shiny separated curtains blowing in the wind left to right in a specific motion standing on the forest floor in the same area between the trees making absolutely no sound, and there was absolutely no wind. It was beautiful to look at but terrifying at the same time. We watched it in silence as it was swaying and It started to emanate the feeling of death in my chest (the sinking feeling), not to be confused with anxiety, I felt pure dread \"set in\" when I was watching it move and it felt like I was going to die or something bad was going to happen. I told my friend specifically \"I don't like this\", he agreed, and we immediately left the forest. We went back in the morning and there was nothing out of the ordinary in the spot where we saw the Spirit (Spiderweb, Garbage, etc.) I was told these beings are called \"Inorganic Beings\". There is information online and books Carlos Castaneda wrote about them. I already know what it was there is no need to comment about what \"you think it was\".\n\nP.S The \"Nightcrawler\" videos are fake, when I first saw them they did not creep me out or bring me back to the moment I had my experience, if they were real I would have been brought back to the exact moment and I would have had shvers.\"Nightcrawler\" is just a made up name by the public/internet because someone made a fake video of them at night and they dubbed them \"Nightcrawlers\". You cannot find where the statues are located or even link them to a certain Tribe online because they are \"not\" called \"Nightcrawlers\", they are called \"Inorganic Beings\" like I said and different tribes that interact with these beings have different names for them in their different Native languages. I was specifically told you can actually see these beings all the time, day or night. So the name is a misconception and is ridiculous. There is absolutely no research, information, or experiences on the internet about \"Nightcrawlers\" because that is not what they are called, there is a ton of research and info on \"Inorganic Beings\" because that is what they are called. The \"Inorganic Being\" I saw it was swaying silently back and forth left to right in the exact same spot the whole time we saw it, not moving forward or backwards, not shuffling its legs like the videos, and it looked more ghoslty/angelic. When you search up \"Inorganic Beings\" online you can see that it says they are visible at all times it is just easier to see them at night. The way it was moving was a soft sway and was very unsettling, nothing like the videos. That is how I know the videos are fake. I am going by my first hand experience and real information, not fake videos off the internet.", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I have added as much detail as possible of what happened the night we saw the Tall White &amp;quot;Inorganic Being&amp;quot; and what it looked like.

It was so white it looked like it was almost giving off light but it was&amp;#39;nt because it was not shining or illuminating the trees or ground and Im pretty sure you could see shadow on it from it moving back and forth in the same place between the trees, had no facial features from what we could see and it was swaying back and forth around that I can only describe as 7-8 foot separated curtains blowing in the wind touching the forest floor, but right and left back and forth in a specific motion with no sound at all, absolutely no wind, dead silent. Emanated the feeling of dread and impending doom when I started being &amp;quot;Mesmorized&amp;quot; by its strange movements. I tried my best to squint my eyes and adjust them to the Inorganic Being/dark better to see what it was doing or if I could make out what it looked like better, but it did not help at all it just still appeared as I described.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;DR: Entered my friends backyard 5 acre forest at night close to 1 am and both of us immediately saw something out of place down the path below about 30-40 feet away from us in between the trees that was tall and white. It appeared to be completely white and soft like light, but it did not illuminate the trees or ground around it. There was no face or any facial features we could see, no arms and seemed like it was shaped in a upside down V. It was making creepy swaying movements with its (whole body) two legs left to right back and forth silently still standing on the forest floor in the exact same spot the whole time we saw it. It did not pick up its legs or walk at all. I can only explain it as looking like 7-8 foot really white, soft, shiny separated curtains blowing in the wind left to right in a specific motion standing on the forest floor in the same area between the trees making absolutely no sound, and there was absolutely no wind. It was beautiful to look at but terrifying at the same time. We watched it in silence as it was swaying and It started to emanate the feeling of death in my chest (the sinking feeling), not to be confused with anxiety, I felt pure dread &amp;quot;set in&amp;quot; when I was watching it move and it felt like I was going to die or something bad was going to happen. I told my friend specifically &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t like this&amp;quot;, he agreed, and we immediately left the forest. We went back in the morning and there was nothing out of the ordinary in the spot where we saw the Spirit (Spiderweb, Garbage, etc.) I was told these beings are called &amp;quot;Inorganic Beings&amp;quot;. There is information online and books Carlos Castaneda wrote about them. I already know what it was there is no need to comment about what &amp;quot;you think it was&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S The &amp;quot;Nightcrawler&amp;quot; videos are fake, when I first saw them they did not creep me out or bring me back to the moment I had my experience, if they were real I would have been brought back to the exact moment and I would have had shvers.&amp;quot;Nightcrawler&amp;quot; is just a made up name by the public/internet because someone made a fake video of them at night and they dubbed them &amp;quot;Nightcrawlers&amp;quot;. You cannot find where the statues are located or even link them to a certain Tribe online because they are &amp;quot;not&amp;quot; called &amp;quot;Nightcrawlers&amp;quot;, they are called &amp;quot;Inorganic Beings&amp;quot; like I said and different tribes that interact with these beings have different names for them in their different Native languages. I was specifically told you can actually see these beings all the time, day or night. So the name is a misconception and is ridiculous. There is absolutely no research, information, or experiences on the internet about &amp;quot;Nightcrawlers&amp;quot; because that is not what they are called, there is a ton of research and info on &amp;quot;Inorganic Beings&amp;quot; because that is what they are called. The &amp;quot;Inorganic Being&amp;quot; I saw it was swaying silently back and forth left to right in the exact same spot the whole time we saw it, not moving forward or backwards, not shuffling its legs like the videos, and it looked more ghoslty/angelic. When you search up &amp;quot;Inorganic Beings&amp;quot; online you can see that it says they are visible at all times it is just easier to see them at night. The way it was moving was a soft sway and was very unsettling, nothing like the videos. That is how I know the videos are fake. I am going by my first hand experience and real information, not fake videos off the internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EBEs", "subreddit_id": "t5_38s9z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EBEs", "subreddit_subscribers": 20975, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Encounter With Tall White \"Inorganic Being\" In Forest (B.C Canada)", "total_awards_received": 0, "ups": 46, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EBEs/comments/cvju3e/encounter_with_tall_white_inorganic_being_in/", "user_reports": [], "view_count": null, "visited": false, "whitelist_status": null, "wls": null}], "domain": "self.EBEs", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cvu7he/encounter_with_tall_white_inorganic_being_in/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cvu7he", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cvu7he/encounter_with_tall_white_inorganic_being_in/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566853904, "score": 2, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53660, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Encounter With Tall White \"Inorganic Being\" In Forest (B.C Canada)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566940285, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EBEs/comments/cvju3e/encounter_with_tall_white_inorganic_being_in/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "1998poetry", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1pe204tt", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566853121, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cvu11i/i_had_my_first_spiritual_experience_i_guess/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cvu11i", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cvu11i/i_had_my_first_spiritual_experience_i_guess/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566853122, "score": 10, "selftext": "So, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down lately and I\u2019m trying new things to just help myself.\n\nMy grandfather was a medium and the co-founder of this little community in my city, the translation would be something like \u201cLove Your Equals Movement\u201d and it\u2019s located in this big house that just gives spiritual help for free, I\u2019ve always heard of it but never really went there until last saturday.\n\nThey gave me natural medicines for my anxiety for free, got into a support group and got hugged a lot!

This is the allegory behind taking the verbal abuse as a reward and not punishment. If your works are not received well in society, it means that what you are doing is working. For good trumps evil in all cases, at least in the long run. Do not let the appearance of evil deter you from your works. Instead, let both positive and negative feedback act as a positive influence within your work. If you welcome all feedback, negative or positive, then the haters have nothing on you. They can't touch you because no matter what they do, you perceive it as positive. And don't accept any feedback, negative or positive, as a means to change what you are doing. Remember, you are your audience. You don't care what the people of the world think. Because you are not of the world and as a result, don't bother yourself with feedback from the ears of the unscrupulous. The only feedback worth anything for your consideration is the feedback of those who are really close to you who are also on a similar spiritual crusade as you.\n\n \n\n\"It's either the Creator that pulls me forward by positive forces or pushes me from behind by negative forces.\"\nRav Michael Laitman\n\n \n\nAt this very moment I am being abused for writing chapter 6.

And if we perceive the information correctly, we will smile during times of abuse because that is God's sign to us that we are travelling the right path. So by manipulating my psychology, I am therefore able to not only control the situations in which I am being abused, but also change their meanings which, as a result, changes their outcome. So by changing ourselves and the way we process information, we also change the situation we are in. This is why Kabbalah is so important. Kabbalah means reception, or more accurately, how to correctly receive. It teaches us how to view the world so that our bad situations become good.\n\n\n\"We don\u2019t see things as they are; we see things as we are.\"\nThe Talmud\n\n\nBut here is the thing: just keep doing good. Because over a long period of time you will notice how people change how they react to your work. You will still get the idiots who don't read anything but still will leave hurtful comments. But you will also find those who can receive what you have to offer. For an example, even though tonight I have been abused a great deal, I also triggered a few people's point in the heart. And I got feedback from chapter 6, relating to chapter 1, meaning this individual has read a lot of what I write. And this is when you, the author, should feel honoured. Getting people immersed into your work is the goal. And when we see that we are reaching it, we are given motivation to keep the cause going. When you notice people remarking on current chapters with the content from past chapters, you know that your information is being received and understood. And you don't want to be received well by all anyways because those who insult you and your work are not worth the time and investment to help them heal. You are a human being and deserve to be treated with respect. If you are not shown respect, then you don't want those individuals as fans anyway. And the few fans you obtain will grow and grow and grow because your fans will never forget you, for you and your works are unique and don't reflect that of society. You are a memorable person. Unforgettable because you perceive the world in a way that no one else can. And this means that you can help society in a way that no one else can.\n\nThis world has been formed as to avoid obtaining political dissonance's such as me. We are taught from childhood that when we do something good, we are rewarded. But this is not a law! People who could have been like me exist, but they stopped because of the negative feedback in which they received. If you have a point of view that is atypical in modern society, then you will get attacked. They will try to make you feel useless and like your point of view is wrong. But let their ignorance be the fuel that fires you. Let it be the bullet that ends their own wasted lives.\n\nThe thing is, is that it is obvious that they are idiots. You can read my writings and then the comments and it will be obvious to anyone with half a brain that those who insult me are fools. I am here giving my heart for free to try and help a lot of people, and there exists people who treat me like trash for doing that. I am here to save the world. I was not asking for your permission. If you are not interested in what I have to say, then move along. And I am not forcing my work upon anyone, so anyone who insults me for trying to save the world is quite literally, trying to destroy the world. We need more people in this world who try and save it. Trying to save the world is not an episode of psychosis. The only way the world will ever be saved is if a lot of people quite literally try to save it. There are no delusions of grandeur, for the work can be clearly assessed for its value. If it makes you uncomfortable to hear about someone who spends their life trying to save the world, then you have major psychological problems. A society has to pay for the consequences of their actions. When their actions involve incarcerating people merely because they are trying to save the world, then we have committed a grave error because the world will never be saved if there are not lots of people trying to save it all at the same time. I can't save this world alone. I need your help.\n\nBut God didn't send us here without the tools to be able to complete our mission. For we are shinigami. For we are soul harversters. Those idiots; we take their souls. We are reapers of this world and the more souls in which we harvest, the more powerful we become. The thing is, is that I am not lying. I did let everybody know from the beginning. But reaping the souls of idiots is not where your reaping activity ends. For my work is created to trigger the point in the heart, and if it is rejected, then it is a successful reap. If you want, you can advise them that you just reaped their fucking worthless soul, however, that is not a requirement. The reap is valid whether or not that person has been advised that their soul has just been harvested. I sometimes just tell them for fun. Because it makes them even more angry.\n\nIf I was extremely rude to someone and they said that they just reaped my soul, then I would promptly ask why and how. I would fish for more information because I highly value my soul. But that is not what happens with idiots. Fools will tell me to take my meds or something like that. They don't care about their soul. Which means that it is yours for the taking. They don't believe in souls or God, which means you can take them freely and make better use of them elsewhere.\n\nI am not lying when I say that I am shinigami. The more you examine my work, the more you will believe that I am shinigami. Everything on the Internet is recorded WITH identifiable information attached to it. They are lying to you entirely about privacy. Eventually, you will be judged by what you have done on the Internet. If you happen to pass by me, you better value your soul or it is mine. There were extremely major occultic events that occurred in my childhood that marked me. I am a government MKUltra experiment. It was a super-soldier that they were trying to create. They wanted eyes on the world that were not bias, so they disconnected me from loyalty to my countries. In this way, I am an objective observer of the events. I am impartial and not aligned with the interests of any one entity. Because of the trauma MKUltra put me through, I became an extremely unique and irreplaceable individual. Those who endure the most difficult of challenges become unique individuals. Trauma in one's life will do one of two things: form you into an amazing individual or break you into thousands of pieces. In fact, to truly see the ships, we must first be broken into a thousand pieces.\n\nTake the souls from those who do not believe in them. It will make you more powerful. Take the souls of those who are cruel to you. After the forbidden fruit, the soul of the first man Adam was shattered into countless pieces. Our objective is to put all the pieces back together again. Just as when my trauma shattered me, I was required to put my pieces back together again. The same applies for our collective soul, for it was once one. But now we need to rebuild it back into one. And this requires collecting all of the souls which are not being used and then combining them together as one force. It is time that we come together as a species and fix our problems once and for all. Those who are unable to do this will have their souls taken from them and utilised elsewhere. A soul is a powerful force and you will learn just how powerful once you begin doing what I am saying. The spiritual world is more real than the one played out in your head. It is this spiritual world that we all share in common. The physical \"reality\" in which we perceive is of an individual nature, whereas the spiritual reality is something we all share in common.\n\nWe are at a turning point in our global society because the poor now have the capabilities to receive just as good of an education as the rich. This means that in the future, one will be judged by their character and abilities and not currency in their bank. This liberates us poor to have some of the opportunities that the rich do. The gap between rich and poor is being filled. Mainstream media refusing to acknowledge my work only means that my work is working. For I am the reaper of mainstream media. Because they refused me, I now refuse them. The same applies to universities. And the same applies to all others who have rejected me.\n\n\"Out in the open wisdom calls aloud, she raises her voice in the public square; on top of the wall she cries out, at the city gate she makes her speech: \u201cHow long will you who are simple love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge? Repent at my rebuke! Then I will pour out my thoughts to you, I will make known to you my teachings. But since you refuse to listen when I call and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand, since you disregard all my advice and do not accept my rebuke, I in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you; I will mock when calamity overtakes you\u2014 when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you. \u201cThen they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not find me, since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the Lord. Since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke, they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes. For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them; but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm.\u201d\nProverbs 1:20-33\n\nhttp://nesmith.net/atheden", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53626, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Shinigami", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566926944, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cvr77w/shinigami/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Lendu2", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_23xkzhj7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566839167, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cvqvtu/reconciliation/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cvqvtu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "ff48d9ae-c323-11e7-bd5d-0e515489cb82", "link_flair_text": "Relationships", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cvqvtu/reconciliation/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566839168, "score": 10, "selftext": "Tomorrow will be a very big day for me.

This is the allegory behind taking the verbal abuse as a reward and not punishment. If your works are not received well in society, it means that what you are doing is working. For good trumps evil in all cases, at least in the long run. Do not let the appearance of evil deter you from your works. Instead, let both positive and negative feedback act as a positive influence within your work. If you welcome all feedback, negative or positive, then the haters have nothing on you. They can't touch you because no matter what they do, you perceive it as positive. And don't accept any feedback, negative or positive, as a means to change what you are doing. Remember, you are your audience. You don't care what the people of the world think. Because you are not of the world and as a result, don't bother yourself with feedback from the ears of the unscrupulous.

Not in the sense of giving to a church but in the sense of giving to whatever is inspiring to me. I know in religions tithing is typically 10% of your income, but since I am not religious I really am not sure how to go about this. And then there\u2019s the question of is it 10% of income or 10% of what\u2019s left after your monthly living expenses? I\u2019ve heard that argued before. \n\nAnd then of course, does 10% really even matter? My dream is to become a huge philanthropist which helps change the world in positive ways but for now as I\u2019m just getting my business started I feel like it\u2019s still important to give to causes I believe in because not only do I think it will strengthen my spiritual connection and support God (or the universe, whatever you\u2019d like to call it) but it will also reinforce that feeling and knowing that I have abundance and that the more I give the more I am supported by and in receivership of abundance because God knows that I will put it to use in the name of love and light. \n\nI want to get into the flow of giving and receiving, letting the universe flow goodness and generosity through me. But as I\u2019m building the foundation of my business I\u2019m struggling with what really makes sense to me right now, because I\u2019m struggling to survive. But I feel if I can give even during my struggle, it will strengthen and reinforce my connection to source and all of my abundance. \n\nThoughts?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53583, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Tithing?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566910527, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cvnpl1/tithing/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "CelestialZeroZero", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4duvbk4m", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566823094, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cvniq6/if_youre_actively_seeking_peace_in_your_life_and/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cvniq6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 58, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cvniq6/if_youre_actively_seeking_peace_in_your_life_and/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "spmVXZS2TDZ7WzOd6P3xDOzh5wCSCJL8hNrPi_bm0E0", "resolutions": [{"height": 60, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_DEC6P04pXAt5CD94NnohphVSL2BawMjNDbdxzdw1bY.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56001bcd239b12781f210bbdd2ad84ac5d88b3e5", "width": 108}, {"height": 121, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_DEC6P04pXAt5CD94NnohphVSL2BawMjNDbdxzdw1bY.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=176bcfa99bc54e7da7fb4fc45ee61349d09af267", "width": 216}, {"height": 180, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_DEC6P04pXAt5CD94NnohphVSL2BawMjNDbdxzdw1bY.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c93a35be688e9e5af4a40d5b3e7f871700206752", "width": 320}, {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_DEC6P04pXAt5CD94NnohphVSL2BawMjNDbdxzdw1bY.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14e15775677ae8b520a83d649bbc802b9ee4592c", "width": 640}, {"height": 540, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_DEC6P04pXAt5CD94NnohphVSL2BawMjNDbdxzdw1bY.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b42e166a803ab740984f30db69deebc1bb2d498b", "width": 960}], "source": {"height": 576, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_DEC6P04pXAt5CD94NnohphVSL2BawMjNDbdxzdw1bY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=79a96dbf5ffcb4ea240c78995427d88dbcdff800", "width": 1024}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1566823096, "score": 76, "selftext": "Meditation is a powerful spiritual tool for finding peace in your life.  But it might surprise you to learn it isn't the only thing you can do to pursue peace.  There is another powerful spiritual practice you might be neglecting called Yoga.  I'm certain you've heard of it - but have you truly absorbed the message of its powerful potential:  it is transformative.  \n\nI hope I can open your eyes to the weight of that word, 'transformative'.  If you could experience what your life would be like after months of dedicated practice for a single day, I guarantee you would do all you could to practice every day.  I want you to think, to really think about all the times you've gotten angry, sour, frustrated, or perhaps even raged out in your life.  Didn't you regret feeling like that a lot?  Didn't you, as an evolving person, set intentions before hand not to get angry but felt you had little to no control of having the emotion overtake you?  It's a familiar story, because it is the path of every human on this Earth.  We all struggle so hard against such powerful forces - the most powerful of which is our very heart - a factor that if you have life wisdom you know is simply outside your control.\n\nBut this isn't about controlling your heart.  Yoga has the capability to free your heart from its chains.  All the negativity in life that you feel can be overcome.  One particularly powerful branch of Yoga is called 'Kundalini Yoga' - it aims specifically at working at releasing all things negative.  I'm not sure if you're aware, but the transformation can be extraordinarily powerful!  As in, you find yourself saying, \"I cannot believe that I could feel this way.\"\n\nI think those of you who are hardcore meditation, practicing every day with determination are on a good path.  But give Kundalini Yoga a week of solid genuine practice and you'll notice an immediate dramatic difference.  The path to peace is laid out in your tears and your sweat.

Nothing exists in the world except what is inside you. Your perception of reality is determined by your understanding of it and the input is fed to your visual cortex. It is like a movie plays in the backs of our heads and this movie reflects what we consider reality. Reality is thus a construct of our own imaginations placed upon the world about what the world is. We learn man-made measurement tools and they are presented to us as absolute, even though they just reflect our said understanding of phenomena in question, in this case a shared value judgement placed upon space.\n\nOur role models in which we choose will determine our future potential. If you can't find any role models worth following that are living, find ones from the grave. And then follow them with your heart, for they are your best friends and are similar to the types of friends in which you are trying to attract. This brings me to my next point, the friendships in which we make will also determine our future potential because they will influence you on a day to day basis. If you choose bad company, then you will likely become bad company. It is better to be alone than endure bad company. Make friends who are kind and loving. Make friends you feel safe around. Make friends who have a spiritual element about them. Make friends with people who lift you higher and avoid those who tear you down.\n\nThroughout my life, Jesus has been my primary role model. Jesus was an amazing man who took on all of society and won. When I was six years old I asked Jesus to come live in my heart. And since then, Jesus and I have been walking through life side by side. Over time I gained more role models of our past sages, but Jesus continued to be my main inspiration. He carried his cross through life and death to show me how to also carry mine. And in the end I am reborn free, now as a divine character. The more you practice the ways of the Divine, the closer to It you will become. Those in this life who represented the most divine character traits should be our role models and not television stars. For they have the most to teach us. Wisdom is the most valuable currency and eventually we as a society will collectively learn this. But ye be warned, do not let those role models become your gods, for they have shown you insight into God and to worship them would be idol worship. The true trinity is divine man, woman, and child. Spirit is not God, for God creates Spirit. And Jesus is God's son, who came to this world to be a role-model for all who understand the allegories presented in the gospels.\n\nThe egoistic mind is one of ill logic. It hears the question, \"what are three things you would bring with you if you were stranded on a deserted island?\" and immediately answers, my iPod, my favourite book, and my necklace my boyfriend gave me instead of something more practical like a water bottle, a bag, and a machete. Our ego cannot be trusted. What it wants is not healthy for our human development. It separates instead of unites. It creates problems where there are none. I am not saying self-love is bad. But I am saying that the way we love ourselves will determine if and how we can truly love others. If you love yourself to the point where none other are important but yourself, then your ego has taken over your life. But here is the good news, the ego isn't you! It is just a byproduct of unhealthy ways of thinking. So all you must do is correct your mode of thinking and that will automatically correct your ego.\n\nEvery individual can only receive according to the inner qualities in which they possess. If they do not possess the awareness of a particular gift of bestowal, then that gift is off of their radar, for they cannot perceive what it is that they do not know. This means that there is an abundant world out there that has many blessings to give us, however, if we do not possess the faculties to be able to receive the gifts, then it will be like they do not exist and as a result, produce no reward for you. If you are not aware of this great service right down the street from you, it is like it does not exist, at least in your reality. If you are to expand your mind to be capable of perceiving more, then those gifts are there for you, for this is the secret mana that was discussed about in Revelation. So in order to access this secret mana, we must develop the corresponding qualities of the mana in which we are attempting to reach. And unfortunately, reaching this is a hard pill to swallow. For it requires us to truly throw away all other gods but Him.\n\n\"I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the\u00a0Lord\u00a0do all these things.\"\nIsaiah 45:7\n\nAll things which manifest before us is ultimately good. The Creator creates bad in order for us to overcome it. Everything which happens is a product of, or has been allowed by, the Living God. This will make us view tragedies in a different light. For all that there is (most of it being Satanic) is but a product of God, to test His true followers to see if they are worthy of the Light. All that you see before you is a test to see 1) whether or not you will develop your spirituality and 2) to what degree you will develop that spirituality. But spirituality is not a selfish thing. It brews internally and manifests as actions of compassion integrated directly into society.\n\nWhat\u00a0does it\u00a0profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him? If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food,\u00a0and\u00a0one of you says to them, \u201cDepart in peace, be warmed and filled,\u201d but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what\u00a0does it\u00a0profit?\u00a0Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.\nJames 2:14-26\n\nBeing spirit filled is being a bestower of gifts. This is the allegory behind, \"my cup runneth over\". Because one who is filled with the Spirit of God provides free spiritual nourishment for all of those who are interested. They not only receive all the pleasures which God bestows upon them, but they also turn that receipt directly into bestowal, for all that is given to them is given back to the world community, in one way or another. Thus the spiritual life is to become possessed with the desire to become like our Creator and bestow as a matter of character instead of receive as a matter of uncorrected character. There is first a point in the heart that is triggered (you reading this content and digesting its meaning). After this, we become spiritual beings and our psychology is automatically corrected. As a result, our worldly actions are automatically corrected. So the correction is only required at one point: a spiritual point. The mental and physical naturally align once this point in the heart is corrected. It is only then that we can truly love others, for beforehand we could only love with conditions. But now we accept people for who they truly are and expect nothing from them. This liberates us to true freedom as we manipulate our psychologies to give instead of take.\n\nWhat you focus on in life is what you will become. If you focus primarily on mainstream television and education, then you will become indoctrinated into its dogmas. Religion is no different. If you focus most of your time on a specific religion, then you will be brainwashed into its dogmatic doctrines. Only spirituality liberates you to study from all doctrines, and decide for yourself truth from falsehood. There is a lot of falsehood out there in the world and it is easy to be tricked. Most of what is produced in the world is done so through a Satanic process, so choose wisely the investments in which you support. In ignorance, you at least have an excuse. But when the veil is lifted, we are held responsible for the decisions in which we make and what their outcomes are on a global scale. Just because we cannot see the sweatshops in which make our clothes, does not make us less responsible for it existing if we are investing our monies into said business practices. I am not saying to not purchase cheap things, for China made a lot of what I own. But what I am saying is to develop an awareness about how the things in which you interact with are made. That way when you choose to purchase X product, you are aware of how it was made. The same applies for our food, for if we are to eat meat, how can we know it was humanely raised and slaughtered? We cannot escape the results of our decisions and a basic awareness of the origin of the products in which we utilise on a day to day basis at least gives us the tools to be able to fight against injustices that were created as a result of our growing day to day needs.\n\nThe ascension from Hell to Heaven is not easy. It requires hard work and dedication to even be able to perceive the ladder. But once we can see it, then we are able to utilise it to forever reach higher and higher. And when our collective human thought rises to the point where it can collectively see the ladder, then humankind has been saved and we will no longer be lost. For when we find our true home - heaven - then we will begin to live in it not only after our deaths, but also while we exist here on Earth. For our home has been right in front of us the entire time! For Heaven does not have dimensions as we understand it. This is the allegory behind making God's Kingdom here on Earth. I choose my home of Heaven both in this life and after. Where is your home? Then live there.\n\nhttp://nesmith.net/atheden", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53568, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Spiritual Ladder", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566896836, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cvljfk/the_spiritual_ladder/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "staticpopcorn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_41lmod1a", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566809540, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cvlf61/any_way_to_ease_the_physical_pains_of_spiritual/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cvlf61", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cvlf61/any_way_to_ease_the_physical_pains_of_spiritual/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566809541, "score": 5, "selftext": "I have recently developed SEVERE migraines out of the blue.

Such purificatory processes are adopted for the ultimate liberation of the living entity. In all such activities it is recommended that one should vibrate om tat sat. The words sad-bh\u0101ve and s\u0101dhu-bh\u0101ve indicate the transcendental situation. One who is acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is called sattva, and one who is fully conscious of activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is called [svar\u016bpa.In](https://svar\u016bpa.In) the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is said that the transcendental subject matter becomes clear in the association of the devotees. Without good association, one cannot achieve transcendental knowledge. When initiating a person or offering the sacred thread, one vibrates the words om tat sat. Similarly, in all kinds of yogic performances, the supreme object, om tat sat is invoked. These words om tat sat are used to perfect all activities. This supreme om tat sat makes everything complete.\n\n**Question 1 : Why there are many prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedic literature ?**\n\n**Question 2 : FITB : One who is acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is called \\_\\_\\_, and one who is fully conscious of activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is called \\_\\_\\_.**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/26-27](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/26-27)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53549, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 17.26-27", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566888856, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cvkhyc/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_172627/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "andynewmanman", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4fzskl2p", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566801083, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cvkb81/why_should_we_waste_another_second_in_this_lesser/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cvkb81", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cvkb81/why_should_we_waste_another_second_in_this_lesser/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566801085, "score": 0, "selftext": "We shouldnt be in this earth world guys because we dont belong here, let me tell you what we have to do: we have to rid ourselves of these lesser world bodies that we are currently possesing and then using willpower make everybody else do the same by giving them dreams somehow from the higher world (the so called spiritual realm) and then we can all be free from this lower world and we can all just live happily ever after in the higher world where we belong and stuff and then all of the \u201cdemons\u201d whatever they are will starve and die!!!\nNO we dont have lessons to learn from this worlds torture!\nNO we arent gonna let Ra and the galactic federation tell us we didnt meet our service to others status quo and we gotta go back to the lower world!!!\nNO this isnt delusional there really is a higher world you have felt things beyond the electrical stimulation in your lower world bodies brain that is the energy and the potentinal for the real food yes thats right there is food that has potentional for pleasure beyond that of energy which is what the machine world of the earth realm is producing all alone lets go back to the higher world use use the wish fufilling mechanism to give us all the knowledge of this higher real food i have yet to achieve myself lets do it today free yourself we have to go home we can make it together!!!\nwhos with me???!!!!\ni would love to answer all questions and comments!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53545, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why should we waste another second in this lesser world?

We all are on the same schedule and all adore her.\n\nThere have been a couple changes in my life though; I\u2019ll be going to Peru for over 4 months from September. Also, I\u2019m currently sick with strep throat. I have had constant reoccurring problems with my health and no doctor has been able to provide any answers (I\u2019m a 20yo female by the way).

I could just sense that he was reaching out so something just came over me and i took his hand and looked him in the eyes and said that it's going to be okay.\n\nHe burst out in tears and put his head against my hand and started kissing it saying thank you.

Democracy is great, as long as I can swill on all my jackassery and cut up with people.  Fascism wasn't an ideology I believed in, I was confused... Military dictatorship and Fascism isn't exactly the same... Military Organizations can still express Liberal views, while remaining conservative.  \n\nI'm an American Veteran now, patiently trying to re-enlist.  This religious bs would really fuck up my day, like it did.  People over the years thought I was a deity, one or another... For real, not just joking, it was always something that amused me in good humor.  I am not the best... Particularly in my last enlistment, I was a child, very young, very inexperienced, horny and naive, gullible stupid ass punk.  I thought I was wise and new better about a lot of shit, did shit anyway, didn't care, completely destructive, my mind was destroyed a long time ago.  I mean, I just wanted to fucking go to battle, reap the glory and party on the rest of my days, beach, margaritas, girls, in between deployments.  That's the only life style that appeals to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell shit, that's enough for now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSalute, inquire if you're interested.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53365, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Morning After Digressions are made", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566825115, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cv8btf/the_morning_after_digressions_are_made/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "derrickjones777", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_721yn", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566738361, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cv89hz/what_is_enlightenment/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cv89hz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cv89hz/what_is_enlightenment/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566738361, "score": 2, "selftext": "[https://medium.com/words-ideas-thoughts/what-is-enlightenment-c4dcebf96176](https://medium.com/words-ideas-thoughts/what-is-enlightenment-c4dcebf96176)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn exploration of the experience of enlightenment, how mindfulness meditation can lead to this experience, and how enlightenment is intrinsically tied to the Illusion of the Self AKA non-duality.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53365, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What is Enlightenment?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566824745, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cv89hz/what_is_enlightenment/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "strawberryjam05", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3tewlgh6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566738021, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cv87cz/acceptance_or_intention_dilemma/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cv87cz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cv87cz/acceptance_or_intention_dilemma/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566738021, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hi there, I am in a really difficult place in my life right now and feel conflicted about what path is right for me to take.

This experience was the only paranormal experience I've ever had, probably the only one that I will ever have in my life and was one of the two most spiritual/terrifying experiences I have ever had. If anyone has had an experience/encounter with something like this please let me know in the comments. I've looked all over the internet and reddit for encounters that were identical to mine or even similar and there are absolutely no encounters like mine. I was told by another reddit user that was from Castaneda's private class and has read all of his books/has been studying his work for many years what I saw was called an \"Inorganic Being\" . I also sent a drawing I did of the \"Inorganic Being\" to a Native on instagram that lives in B.C not to far from me, and he knew what it was right away, told me what the name of the \"Inorganic Being\" was in his Native language and gave me a bit of hints to what it was (that I am not going to share in my post out of respect.) With the Natives information and the other information I received about Castaneda, I compared all the details with my experience and that is how I know it was a \"Inorganic Being\". When you compare notes they are all the same, but in different wording.)\n\nTL;DR close to the bottom of post but I suggest you read the whole post though because it is worth it.)\n\nEncounter/experience:\n\nBack in 2010 in British Columbia, Canada approximately in early October or mid October when I was 16 (I am 25 years old now) my old friend lived in the rural part of my city(has a lot of forest area and farm land) His backyard has 5 acres of forest with a few houses surrounded in the distance around the outskirts of the forest. Me and him would go and explore the forest all the time because it was quite mystical and just a cool place to wander. This one time me and my friend went outside to his forest with his dog like we would usually do in the daytime, but this time at night in his backyard forest at about 1 am to go explore and smoke a joint like usual (Which we were sober at the time and did'nt even get to smoking because of encountering the \"Inorganic Being\" and being terrified, we ended up smoking it inside his basement/room).\n\nThere's a steep cliff made out of forest floor when you first walk in. It is only about 10 - 15 feet into the forest area from the \"entrance\" of the forest. When we were standing at the cliff/ravine before the path way leading down to the rest of the forest which was the only safe way to walk down especially at night, I could see a 7-8 feet tall pure white soft figure and it was inbetween two trees moving around softly swaying left to right back and forth between the trees standing (literally touching the forest floor) in the exact same place the whole time we saw it making absolutely no sound and there was absolutely no wind.\n\nI wasn't even going to say anything about the figure to my friend at first because I was waiting for my friend to say something. We observed it for a couple seconds in complete silence and we're \"mesmerized\" by it's movements, then I asked my friend if he saw it and he said yeah he could as well.  We stood silent in fear as we were watching it do its strange unsettling soft swaying movements/trying to adjust our eyes to the Inorganic Being and see what it was doing. As I was in a slight daze watching it sway I started to feel a ominous energy \"set in\" and felt impending doom (the sinking feeling) in my chest area like when you are going to die or are in a life threatening situation and I had shivers going throughout my body. That's when I told my friend specifically \"I don't like this\", he agreed and we left immediately. I wasn't so much scared of the sight of the Inorganic Being, I was more curious about the strange movements it was making and what it really looked like, I was scared of the feeling of death it made me feel. It felt like I was going to literally die, or something really bad was going to happen.\n\nThe \"Inorganic Being\" was just white long limbs seemed to be at least 7 - 8 feet tall from where we were standing which was about 30-40 feet away from us. It was not a trick of the mind or light, there was no light nor moon shining in the forest because it was filled with tall pine trees/other vegetation had various leveling's. It was not a spiderweb or any sort of garbage (we had gone back in the morning daylight and saw nothing out of the ordinary). His forest is pristine condition cause no one ever goes in it, there is no garbage. We got into about 10-15 feet in the forest and were at the top of the ravine standing at a cliff/before the pathway to down (The safe way to get down) and the \"Inorganic Being\" was in between trees down below where we would take the pathway downwards. There were no houses close enough to give off any light or give off a shine through the trees and the Inorganic Being was not see through it looked like it was almost solid, but it was very ghostly/spirit looking as well. It was upside down v shaped and It had no facial features/head at all from what we could see in the dark.\n\nIt was so white it looked like it was almost shining but it wasn't because it was'nt giving of any light of any sort, it was pure white ,looked soft and kind of shiny, it was swaying left to right, right to left with its two really long arms they almost looked like separated curtains swaying in the wind. The best way I can describe it is 7-8 foot ,thin separated curtains, blowing in the wind touching the forest floor, but right and left back and forth in a specific motion with no sound at all, absolutely no wind, dead silent. Its movements were \"Psychedelic\" and sort of \"hypnotizing\". It was soft like Charlies white spirit entering Peters body after the attic scene from \"Hereditary\" Probably the most solid description I can give of what it looked like. It was making no sound at all while it was swaying, it was beautiful to look at and terrifying/unsettling at the same time, that's why it was so astonishing to look at, it was almost angelic. There were absolutely no sounds in the forest, it was dead silent while it was moving back and forth. Its movements could have been a lure of some sort because it did not move towards us or anywhere, or it was just letting us know to stay away because it was scared to death as well or just didn't want us to disturb it. It was literally something you would see in a science fiction horror movie.\n\nWe left very quick because we did'nt know what it was, it scared us and our intuition (my feeling of dread/death) told us it was dangerous. I remember my friend yelling something at it because he could tell his dog was scared , I am entirely positive the dog was whimpering. And the Inorganic Being was just still swaying back and forth left to right between the trees in the same exact same spot. We left quickly because we were terrified and did'nt plan on wanting to even see what it was. Almost immediately after we got out of the forest (left the \"entrance\" of the forest (which we were not far from) it felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders and the feeling of dread left pretty much immediately. I will never forget walking out of the forest that night.\n\nThere is absolutely no animals in Northern British Columbia, Canada or the rest of Canada and U.S that look close to what we saw, there are absolutely no animals that are 7-8 feet tall and stand on 2 legs. It did not have a body( It's 2 legs/limbs were its body) It was not a animal, and there is no possible way to \"debunk\" this. I have explored all the options of what it could have been. This was the first time we ever went out to his forest at night, and it was the last time we ever went in the forest at night.\n\nThe forest is 5 acres of tall pine trees it is quite dense in areas, and quite open in others due to vegetation, just the one area where we saw the Spirit was huge. There is a creek going through the forest close by to where we saw the Spirit at the lowest level of the forest. Around the area of town it is mostly just a couple million dollar houses, and farm/forest area. It is pretty much the greenbelt of my city. He has no neighbors that are close to the location because as I said his forest is 5 acres with the closest neighbors being at least 3 blocks down the street on the right hand side of the forest. To this day the feeling that I had when I saw the Inorganic Being move still gives me shivers. The fact that we went out to the forest at that time really late at night and happened to see that freaks me out as well, cause it was clearly meant to be seen by us. If we went out any later or any sooner we might not have seen it in his forest at that moment of time. Like I said, I didn't have to point out to my friend where the Inorganic Being was he automatically saw it at the same time I saw it. I think the feeling of dread could have possibly have been a warning to keep away from it and that is why me and my friend left right away without any hesitation. It is now 9 years later I am 25 and the experience still scares me.\n\nThis was my only Parnaormal Experience I have ever had. There was no paranormal activity that I experienced when I would go to my friends house or on his property/ in his forest besides the one experience/encounter, but now that I think back on hanging outside there and exploring the woods there is for sure something \"special\" about the whole location.\n\nI understand a lot of people are scared of these types of things and they don't want to believe they exist, but would have had to be there yourself to understand what it looked like, see the creeping movements, and feel what I felt. We have scaled my friends forest including the area where we saw the Inorganic Being at least 20 different times/ different days before hand seeing it and we went back the day after to the exact spot where we saw the Inorganic Being in the forest and noticed nothing out of the ordinary. So we know that it was some sort of \"being\" and it was something we shouldn't have been seeing or attempt to go up to.\n\nHere is my full description of the \"Inorganic Being\", me and my friend saw:\n\n7-8 feet Tall, Pure White (When I mean \"pure white\" I mean Paper, Bone white) Not see-through, Just 2 Pure White Long limbs (from what we could see in the dark). It was so white it looked like it was almost giving off light but it was'nt because it was not shining or illuminating the trees or ground and Im pretty sure you could see shadow on it from it moving back and forth in the same place between the trees, had no facial features from what we could see and it was swaying back and forth around that I can only describe as 7-8 foot separated curtains blowing in the wind touching the forest floor, but right and left back and forth in a specific motion with no sound at all, absolutely no wind, dead silent. Emanated the feeling of dread and impending doom when I started being \"Mesmorized\" by its strange movements. I tried my best to squint my eyes and adjust them to the Inorganic Being/dark better to see what it was doing or if I could make out what it looked like better, but it did not help at all it just still appeared as I described.\n\nTl;DR: Entered my friends backyard 5 acre forest at night close to 1 am and both of us immediately saw something out of place down the path below about 30-40 feet away from us in between the trees that was tall and white. It appeared to be completely white and soft like light, but it did not illuminate the trees or ground around it. There was no face or any facial features we could see, no arms and seemed like it was shaped in a upside down V. It was making creepy swaying movements with its (whole body) two legs left to right back and forth silently still standing on the forest floor in the exact same spot the whole time we saw it. It did not pick up its legs or walk at all. I can only explain it as looking like 7-8 foot really white, soft, shiny separated curtains blowing in the wind left to right in a specific motion standing on the forest floor in the same area between the trees making absolutely no sound, and there was absolutely no wind. It was beautiful to look at but terrifying at the same time. We watched it in silence as it was swaying and It started to emanate the feeling of death in my chest (the sinking feeling), not to be confused with anxiety, I felt pure dread \"set in\" when I was watching it move and it felt like I was going to die or something bad was going to happen. I told my friend specifically \"I don't like this\", he agreed, and we immediately left the forest. We went back in the morning and there was nothing out of the ordinary in the spot where we saw the Spirit (Spiderweb, Garbage, etc.) I was told these beings are called \"Inorganic Beings\". There is information online and books Carlos Castaneda wrote about them.\n\nP.S \"Nightcrawler\" is just a made up name by the public/internet because someone made a fake video of them at night and they dubbed them \"Nightcrawlers\". You cannot find where the statues are located or even link them to a certain Tribe online because they are \"not\" called \"Nightcrawlers\", they are called \"Inorganic Beings\" like I said and different tribes that interact with these beings have different names for them in their different Native languages. I was specifically told you can actually see these beings all the time, day or night. So the name is a misconception and is ridiculous. There is absolutely no research, information, or experiences on the internet about \"Nightcrawlers\" because that is not what they are called, there is a ton of research and info on \"Inorganic Beings\" because that is what they are called. The \"Inorganic Being\" I saw it was swaying silently back and forth left to right in the exact same spot the whole time we saw it, not moving forward or backwards, not shuffling its legs like the videos, and it looked more ghoslty/angelic. When you search up \"Inorganic Beings\" online you can see that it says they are visible at all times it is just easier to see them at night. The way it was moving was a soft sway and was very unsettling, nothing like the videos. That is how I know the videos are fake. I am going by my first hand experience and real information, not fake videos off the internet.", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I have added as much detail as possible of what happened the night we saw the Tall White &amp;quot;Inorganic Being&amp;quot; and what it looked like.

With the Natives information and the other information I received about Castaneda, I compared all the details with my experience and that is how I know it was a &amp;quot;Inorganic Being&amp;quot;. When you compare notes they are all the same, but in different wording.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR close to the bottom of post but I suggest you read the whole post though because it is worth it.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Encounter/experience:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back in 2010 in British Columbia, Canada approximately in early October or mid October when I was 16 (I am 25 years old now) my old friend lived in the rural part of my city(has a lot of forest area and farm land) His backyard has 5 acres of forest with a few houses surrounded in the distance around the outskirts of the forest. Me and him would go and explore the forest all the time because it was quite mystical and just a cool place to wander. This one time me and my friend went outside to his forest with his dog like we would usually do in the daytime, but this time at night in his backyard forest at about 1 am to go explore and smoke a joint like usual (Which we were sober at the time and did&amp;#39;nt even get to smoking because of encountering the &amp;quot;Inorganic Being&amp;quot; and being terrified, we ended up smoking it inside his basement/room).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a steep cliff made out of forest floor when you first walk in. It is only about 10 - 15 feet into the forest area from the &amp;quot;entrance&amp;quot; of the forest. When we were standing at the cliff/ravine before the path way leading down to the rest of the forest which was the only safe way to walk down especially at night, I could see a 7-8 feet tall pure white soft figure and it was inbetween two trees moving around softly swaying left to right back and forth between the trees standing (literally touching the forest floor) in the exact same place the whole time we saw it making absolutely no sound and there was absolutely no wind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t even going to say anything about the figure to my friend at first because I was waiting for my friend to say something. We observed it for a couple seconds in complete silence and we&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;mesmerized&amp;quot; by it&amp;#39;s movements, then I asked my friend if he saw it and he said yeah he could as well.  We stood silent in fear as we were watching it do its strange unsettling soft swaying movements/trying to adjust our eyes to the Inorganic Being and see what it was doing. As I was in a slight daze watching it sway I started to feel a ominous energy &amp;quot;set in&amp;quot; and felt impending doom (the sinking feeling) in my chest area like when you are going to die or are in a life threatening situation and I had shivers going throughout my body. That&amp;#39;s when I told my friend specifically &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t like this&amp;quot;, he agreed and we left immediately. I wasn&amp;#39;t so much scared of the sight of the Inorganic Being, I was more curious about the strange movements it was making and what it really looked like, I was scared of the feeling of death it made me feel. It felt like I was going to literally die, or something really bad was going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Inorganic Being&amp;quot; was just white long limbs seemed to be at least 7 - 8 feet tall from where we were standing which was about 30-40 feet away from us. It was not a trick of the mind or light, there was no light nor moon shining in the forest because it was filled with tall pine trees/other vegetation had various leveling&amp;#39;s. It was not a spiderweb or any sort of garbage (we had gone back in the morning daylight and saw nothing out of the ordinary). His forest is pristine condition cause no one ever goes in it, there is no garbage. We got into about 10-15 feet in the forest and were at the top of the ravine standing at a cliff/before the pathway to down (The safe way to get down) and the &amp;quot;Inorganic Being&amp;quot; was in between trees down below where we would take the pathway downwards. There were no houses close enough to give off any light or give off a shine through the trees and the Inorganic Being was not see through it looked like it was almost solid, but it was very ghostly/spirit looking as well. It was upside down v shaped and It had no facial features/head at all from what we could see in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was so white it looked like it was almost shining but it wasn&amp;#39;t because it was&amp;#39;nt giving of any light of any sort, it was pure white ,looked soft and kind of shiny, it was swaying left to right, right to left with its two really long arms they almost looked like separated curtains swaying in the wind. The best way I can describe it is 7-8 foot ,thin separated curtains, blowing in the wind touching the forest floor, but right and left back and forth in a specific motion with no sound at all, absolutely no wind, dead silent. Its movements were &amp;quot;Psychedelic&amp;quot; and sort of &amp;quot;hypnotizing&amp;quot;. It was soft like Charlies white spirit entering Peters body after the attic scene from &amp;quot;Hereditary&amp;quot; Probably the most solid description I can give of what it looked like. It was making no sound at all while it was swaying, it was beautiful to look at and terrifying/unsettling at the same time, that&amp;#39;s why it was so astonishing to look at, it was almost angelic. There were absolutely no sounds in the forest, it was dead silent while it was moving back and forth. Its movements could have been a lure of some sort because it did not move towards us or anywhere, or it was just letting us know to stay away because it was scared to death as well or just didn&amp;#39;t want us to disturb it. It was literally something you would see in a science fiction horror movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We left very quick because we did&amp;#39;nt know what it was, it scared us and our intuition (my feeling of dread/death) told us it was dangerous. I remember my friend yelling something at it because he could tell his dog was scared , I am entirely positive the dog was whimpering. And the Inorganic Being was just still swaying back and forth left to right between the trees in the same exact same spot. We left quickly because we were terrified and did&amp;#39;nt plan on wanting to even see what it was. Almost immediately after we got out of the forest (left the &amp;quot;entrance&amp;quot; of the forest (which we were not far from) it felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders and the feeling of dread left pretty much immediately. I will never forget walking out of the forest that night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is absolutely no animals in Northern British Columbia, Canada or the rest of Canada and U.S that look close to what we saw, there are absolutely no animals that are 7-8 feet tall and stand on 2 legs. It did not have a body( It&amp;#39;s 2 legs/limbs were its body) It was not a animal, and there is no possible way to &amp;quot;debunk&amp;quot; this. I have explored all the options of what it could have been. This was the first time we ever went out to his forest at night, and it was the last time we ever went in the forest at night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The forest is 5 acres of tall pine trees it is quite dense in areas, and quite open in others due to vegetation, just the one area where we saw the Spirit was huge. There is a creek going through the forest close by to where we saw the Spirit at the lowest level of the forest. Around the area of town it is mostly just a couple million dollar houses, and farm/forest area. It is pretty much the greenbelt of my city. He has no neighbors that are close to the location because as I said his forest is 5 acres with the closest neighbors being at least 3 blocks down the street on the right hand side of the forest. To this day the feeling that I had when I saw the Inorganic Being move still gives me shivers. The fact that we went out to the forest at that time really late at night and happened to see that freaks me out as well, cause it was clearly meant to be seen by us. If we went out any later or any sooner we might not have seen it in his forest at that moment of time. Like I said, I didn&amp;#39;t have to point out to my friend where the Inorganic Being was he automatically saw it at the same time I saw it. I think the feeling of dread could have possibly have been a warning to keep away from it and that is why me and my friend left right away without any hesitation. It is now 9 years later I am 25 and the experience still scares me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was my only Parnaormal Experience I have ever had. There was no paranormal activity that I experienced when I would go to my friends house or on his property/ in his forest besides the one experience/encounter, but now that I think back on hanging outside there and exploring the woods there is for sure something &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; about the whole location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand a lot of people are scared of these types of things and they don&amp;#39;t want to believe they exist, but would have had to be there yourself to understand what it looked like, see the creeping movements, and feel what I felt. We have scaled my friends forest including the area where we saw the Inorganic Being at least 20 different times/ different days before hand seeing it and we went back the day after to the exact spot where we saw the Inorganic Being in the forest and noticed nothing out of the ordinary. So we know that it was some sort of &amp;quot;being&amp;quot; and it was something we shouldn&amp;#39;t have been seeing or attempt to go up to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is my full description of the &amp;quot;Inorganic Being&amp;quot;, me and my friend saw:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7-8 feet Tall, Pure White (When I mean &amp;quot;pure white&amp;quot; I mean Paper, Bone white) Not see-through, Just 2 Pure White Long limbs (from what we could see in the dark). It was so white it looked like it was almost giving off light but it was&amp;#39;nt because it was not shining or illuminating the trees or ground and Im pretty sure you could see shadow on it from it moving back and forth in the same place between the trees, had no facial features from what we could see and it was swaying back and forth around that I can only describe as 7-8 foot separated curtains blowing in the wind touching the forest floor, but right and left back and forth in a specific motion with no sound at all, absolutely no wind, dead silent. Emanated the feeling of dread and impending doom when I started being &amp;quot;Mesmorized&amp;quot; by its strange movements. I tried my best to squint my eyes and adjust them to the Inorganic Being/dark better to see what it was doing or if I could make out what it looked like better, but it did not help at all it just still appeared as I described.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;DR: Entered my friends backyard 5 acre forest at night close to 1 am and both of us immediately saw something out of place down the path below about 30-40 feet away from us in between the trees that was tall and white. It appeared to be completely white and soft like light, but it did not illuminate the trees or ground around it. There was no face or any facial features we could see, no arms and seemed like it was shaped in a upside down V. It was making creepy swaying movements with its (whole body) two legs left to right back and forth silently still standing on the forest floor in the exact same spot the whole time we saw it. It did not pick up its legs or walk at all. I can only explain it as looking like 7-8 foot really white, soft, shiny separated curtains blowing in the wind left to right in a specific motion standing on the forest floor in the same area between the trees making absolutely no sound, and there was absolutely no wind. It was beautiful to look at but terrifying at the same time. We watched it in silence as it was swaying and It started to emanate the feeling of death in my chest (the sinking feeling), not to be confused with anxiety, I felt pure dread &amp;quot;set in&amp;quot; when I was watching it move and it felt like I was going to die or something bad was going to happen. I told my friend specifically &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t like this&amp;quot;, he agreed, and we immediately left the forest. We went back in the morning and there was nothing out of the ordinary in the spot where we saw the Spirit (Spiderweb, Garbage, etc.) I was told these beings are called &amp;quot;Inorganic Beings&amp;quot;. There is information online and books Carlos Castaneda wrote about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S &amp;quot;Nightcrawler&amp;quot; is just a made up name by the public/internet because someone made a fake video of them at night and they dubbed them &amp;quot;Nightcrawlers&amp;quot;. You cannot find where the statues are located or even link them to a certain Tribe online because they are &amp;quot;not&amp;quot; called &amp;quot;Nightcrawlers&amp;quot;, they are called &amp;quot;Inorganic Beings&amp;quot; like I said and different tribes that interact with these beings have different names for them in their different Native languages. I was specifically told you can actually see these beings all the time, day or night. So the name is a misconception and is ridiculous. There is absolutely no research, information, or experiences on the internet about &amp;quot;Nightcrawlers&amp;quot; because that is not what they are called, there is a ton of research and info on &amp;quot;Inorganic Beings&amp;quot; because that is what they are called. The &amp;quot;Inorganic Being&amp;quot; I saw it was swaying silently back and forth left to right in the exact same spot the whole time we saw it, not moving forward or backwards, not shuffling its legs like the videos, and it looked more ghoslty/angelic. When you search up &amp;quot;Inorganic Beings&amp;quot; online you can see that it says they are visible at all times it is just easier to see them at night. The way it was moving was a soft sway and was very unsettling, nothing like the videos. That is how I know the videos are fake. I am going by my first hand experience and real information, not fake videos off the internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Humanoidencounters", "subreddit_id": "t5_31wuv", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Humanoidencounters", "subreddit_subscribers": 64926, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Encounter With Tall White Figure In Forest (B.C Canada)", "total_awards_received": 0, "ups": 281, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Humanoidencounters/comments/c13d4r/encounter_with_tall_white_figure_in_forest_bc/", "user_reports": [], "view_count": null, "visited": false, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}], "domain": "self.Humanoidencounters", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cv704h/encounter_with_tall_white_figure_in_forest_bc/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cv704h", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cv704h/encounter_with_tall_white_figure_in_forest_bc/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566729557, "score": 3, "selftext": "", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53350, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Encounter With Tall White Figure In Forest (B.C Canada)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566815936, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Humanoidencounters/comments/c13d4r/encounter_with_tall_white_figure_in_forest_bc/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "japaneseblue", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_fzfzh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566724354, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cv6d46/advice_for_people_in_relationships_tf_or/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cv6d46", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "ff48d9ae-c323-11e7-bd5d-0e515489cb82", "link_flair_text": "Relationships", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cv6d46/advice_for_people_in_relationships_tf_or/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566724355, "score": 1, "selftext": "Just a link to a 2min clip maybe we should listen for once.\n\n https://youtu.be/e8xrnzf_Jgg", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53340, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Advice for people in relationships, TF, or spiritually inclined", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566810721, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cv6d46/advice_for_people_in_relationships_tf_or/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "engdahl80", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_hmgz7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566723659, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cv69wt/energy_in_vinyl_records/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cv69wt", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cv69wt/energy_in_vinyl_records/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566723660, "score": 4, "selftext": "Hi,\n\nDoes anyone else feel like a vinyl record has a special energy to it?

I have diagnosed unspecified szhiophrenia. I've never heared voices or seen hallucinations, so I'm not talking about that sort of disease as people often may imagine with people labeled by this. How it feels like, is that basically I feel my energies being on so different level every year, and even every day. I feel as when I'm typing this, I have already whole story on soul level written, but as soon as I see this box where I'm supposed to write, my energy gets stuck for example and I choose different words, often more boring. I want to say that when you 'Talk', you send out energy with your voice, but in my case, it brings me pain sometimes to even use my voice. As I'm only using my voice, but it's not connected to my soul. As the one thing, your voice, throat, your eyes (eyes are the mirror of soul) - the things that actually communicate with world, they are not there. I know that my mother did not answer to me when I was child and did not give love energy, although she loves me. So I believe when you learn to speak, at young age, you need to be responded by mother, father in loving way so you even learn to the vocubulary and meaning behind it. My mother neglected me socially, I'm sure of it. Words are the expression of the soul. And I feel as if I live, but I'm unable to speak so that I feel normal, that it doesn't hurt my soul. It's all pretty crazy. I feel as I'm watching whole world as an observer because of that, because every time someone speaks to me, I go into that 'shell', into that dark, cold soul where I almost feel like I'm uncapable of answering without hurting my own soul. I always answer, but I always get feedback too, my own soul sends me feedback how I felt when I opened my mouth. I feel a lot, even when you feel numb, you still feel something, so therefore after every few years I experience 'psychosis' as they call it, but for me it's the only time when I'm feeling good in my own skin. It may come out as emotional burst for example, and then I enter into 'zone' where whole universe is in tune with me. Children come talk to me. Nature feels alive. I live in syncronity. I feel love. Music is intense and beautiful. I feel as 'mental illness' is not only 'mental', it's spiritual, it's illness on soul level. I want answers. I have tons of questions, tons... But my inwardly world is different, quick, but I can't write it. Therefore I end this writing soon. Questions: How a person feels 'whole' with herself without calling the reality psychotic? How can I connect my soul with my voice? Have you ever heared anything like this? What is a spirit, energy, soul, god, mind - do they have to work together in order to be whole?

Just need some advice or guidance! My ex and I broke up around 8 months ago. The first 3 or 4 months were really tough for me. I blame myself for quite some time and then realized that she\u2019s just not a good person. I know I should let the idea of good and bad but she has hurt a lot of people. Because of our breakup I hit my absolute lowest but I am at my highest now. It is all because of her. I am happy and better..... Actually no... she broke me and I fixed myself. I did that. \n\nHere\u2019s my problem. I don\u2019t love her anymore and I don\u2019t want her back. I practiced all that I could to move on. Moving on for me isn\u2019t dating someone else. For now, I am working on myself but sometimes it still hurts so bad and sadness turns to anger so quickly. I don\u2019t want to be angry anymore. I want to wish her the best and be happy for whatever happens in her life but she is in a new relationship. I found out recently she moved on while still telling me we had a chance and it\u2019s put me back at this place of what the fuck ???? \n\nJust..... how do I just let it go? How do I not care anymore about how she hurt me? I realized today that a lot of it is jealousy but also realized that my jealousy is unnecessary. Our relationship was far from perfect. She hid me from everyone. She lied to me all throughout our relationship. I was sad more than I was happy and when I was happy it was because I made up some fake bullshit in my head about what we were. I found myself defending her shitty actions more than I could speak highly of her. She was incredibly abusive emotionally and I never deserved that. I deserve better and WILL get better. \n\nI guess in a way I gave myself some answers here...

I hit a gravity bong, and instantly a great high. The first thing I felt was being outside my body, it was as if my soul left my body, and I was left with just my soul, along with everything being in slow motion and having trails follow everything moving. The thing I admire most about marijuana is that it forces you to be in the present moment. I\u2019ve never felt so present, and so happy and relaxed. Instantly I was in a meditative state, along with very high levels of euphoria and relaxation. Personally I believe in God, I am a Hindu, however this can help any person regardless of your beliefs. It was if my ego died in the 7 hour experience that I had, the present moment made me feel content, and feeling out of my body wasn\u2019t a bad thing. My soul felt like it was in a different dimension, my soul was the puppeteer of this body of flesh, except I was no longer a body, I was a soul. This was just a brief insight of my experience, when I started to relax everything felt like it was moving like a wave, and later on I had hallucinations, which I completely didn\u2019t expect. I hope people will recognize the spiritual value of marijuana, because it certainly has enlightened me in some ways. Keep in mind that I have a very small tolerance to THC and CBD, so I think it\u2019s important that if you want to use it spiritually, then don\u2019t use it as much or else you won\u2019t get much of a high and less of a spiritual experience.

i don\u2019t believe it was a coincidence at all. i\u2019ve loved this girl for nearly two years and never thought confessing my feelings would be a good idea until yesterday. i believe that everything happens for a reason and so there has to be SOME reason this happened, yesterday of all days. but nothing has really happened as a result of this yet, apart from A saying we could possibly try to date someday.\n\ni\u2019ll keep you all updated if something good (or bad) comes out of this.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53214, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "at times i feel this unbelievably strong force that i have no control over.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566761857, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cuy0lt/at_times_i_feel_this_unbelievably_strong_force/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Dainty_B", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2jsb6hmh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566674993, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cuxx0i/spiritualwitchy_facebook_page/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cuxx0i", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cuxx0i/spiritualwitchy_facebook_page/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566674994, "score": 3, "selftext": "Hi all, I recently created a witchy/spirituality themed Facebook page.

How the different types of sacrifice, penance, charity etc can become means of spiritual elevation ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** \"It has been explained that penance, sacrifice, charity and foods are divided into three categories: the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. But whether first class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned, contaminated by the material modes of nature. When they are aimed at the Supreme-om tat sat, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal-they become means for spiritual elevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an objective is indicated. These three words,om tat sat, particularly indicate the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\".\"Formerly when Brahm\u0101, the first created living entity, performed sacrifices, he spoke these three names of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The same principle holds by disciplic succession. So this hymn has great significance. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 recommends, therefore, that any work done should be done for om tat sat, or for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity, and sacrifice with these three words, he is acting in Kr\u1e63na consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a scientific execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return home, back to Godhead. There is no loss of energy in acting in such a transcendental way.\".\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 17.23, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/cuvk0y/qa\\_verse\\_no\\_1723/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/cuvk0y/qa_verse_no_1723/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 53193, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "QA : Verse no. 17.23", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566750694, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cuvk7d/qa_verse_no_1723/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "saiglai", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_nm95j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566662645, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cuv7jj/is_there_any_spiritual_teacher_who_teaches_god_is/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cuv7jj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cuv7jj/is_there_any_spiritual_teacher_who_teaches_god_is/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566662645, "score": 4, "selftext": "So Ive read countless of NDE:s, much material from spiritual teachers or mediums and even many trip report.

I had smoked a little weed and felt an urge to close my eyes and meditate, which was very unusual - I'm typically very visual on marijuana. I decided to explore it, because it was so unexpected.\n\nWhen I started meditating, my focus wanted to be inside my head (imagine the center of your brain), and as I put focus there, it felt as if that point started spinning (sorry, I can't explain it better) and was rising/expanding, which made me scared because it felt as if that center (which to me felt like some sort of core of consciousness) was rising and about to leave my head. I figured that rationally, this could not happen, so I went ahead and kept on going. The spinning subsided, and changed into an\u2026 energy, that I felt a little bit like heat or a glow, in my right hemisphere, accompanied by a tingling in parts of my scalp. I swear I could have outlined the right hemisphere of my brain just by following the boundary of that feeling.\n\nOne thing that helped me is that it felt like a similar energy I felt during my first Ayahuasca ceremony, which made my right arm dance to the music when I completely relaxed. This has happened to some degree in all ceremonies I've participated in since, often focused on the left hand, around the sacrum and the whole spine. \n\nThis changed the way I meditate. I still fumble with mindfulness meditation when I need to wind down, de-stress or relax, but I can also at times (especially with a little weed) get to a point where I focus on the very top of my head, which then feels as if it starts to glow, and fill my whole brain with this energy. A shift can direct it into my body, which feels as if my body should be glowing, or radiating something. It's a state of very high energy, quite different from the calm state of mindfulness meditation. It's also a very creative state. I'm not exactly worried, and more curious, because the experience is controllable to some degree: when I stop focusing on my head, it's as if my body and brain slowly goe back to the normal state (although falling asleep often requires an hour of more from the time I stop, no matter how tired I am. This rhymes well with the fact that my blood pressure and heart rate increase in this state, often to a degree that I feel my head wobble a bit with every heartbeat. I'm aware it could just be placebo, that I am experiencing something because I expect it, but it feels so real, and the more I practice, the more I can turn it on and off.\n\nAs the energy I experienced during the Ayahuasca ceremonies had clear spiritual connections for me, and this energy seems related, I thought this could be a good place to ask.

I'm writing here today because I am being conflicted with something which is causing me suffering. I appreciate if you give me your intake and recommendations about what I could do in this situation. I'll keep this as short as possible to make it easy on you. \n\nFirst things first, I must say that I deal with an OCD brain/mind: this means I constantly have intrusive thoughts and many of them are ego-dystonic, which means many of them go against the ego (which causes anxiety, depression, stress, etc). That is relevant to my situation because I currently have an obsession in which my thoughts tell me I must become a spiritual leader or else I won't reach happiness in life. Many people, including my spiritual leader and myself know this entire ''spiritual leader'' thing is bogus (or a lie manufactured by OCD in order to keep me in a state of fear and paralysis and I know this because I've felt this truth before: that this ''spiritual leader thing'' doesn't even exist and isn't even a thing). \n\nHere's where things get conflicted:\n\nWhen I flow from the heart (or heart chakra), I have the most amazing days ever. I used to think I was dealing with depression and depersonalization (and perhaps I still am) but it wasn't until recently that I became of what ''flowing from the heart'' meant and I started doing it more. I realized I love filming, composing music, and skateboarding. I went from having ''Ok days'' to having some of the best days of my last three years no joke just flowing like this. But then, there is the ego, the ego that loves to be seen as ''the spiritual man'': the man who loves to be seen as spiritual and philosophical because people will ''think I am smart'', that ''I have thought things through'', and also to ''help people'' (while just thinking about myself) and recommend things I as an individual don't even do such as ''become a vegan or vegetarian'', ''meditate, it will truly help'', ''go out there and exercise'', etc. There is no heart for me there; nothing that fulfills me. When I ''like'' being seen as the ''spiritual man'' the ego gets fulfilled but the heart feels empty. I know my heart leads me towards the arts and OCD activity has tried its best to make me intensely doubt that. \n\nMy question is: how can I start ignoring the ego (thoughts) which are obsessed with something that doesn't truly fulfill me and perhaps redirect it to boost my art path (which is the one the heart has led me to and the one which truly fills me)?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 52985, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My heart leads me towars the arts, but the ego somewhere else.

The past 2 months have been amazing I don't crave processed foods, meat, drugs, money, porn. Just basically everything that my old self would attend to to make me feel like me. I was just being and letting the flow take control of things. I had such a strong appreciation for life and all the small things that I had taken for granted.\n\nBut today I out of nowhere had a mental breakdown in front of my mum which got her really scared. I kept gasping for air and pulling my hair out bawling my eyes out. I really don't know where it came from and feel so stupid I let it happen cos I've been through MUCH MUCH worse and haven't been fazed by anything before. I've recovered a bit from this event but can't help but feel like my spiritual journey is just another mental health issue and that I never really was unattached from the self as much as I think I was? \n\nI've never really reached out to anyone but I with what happened today I think I could learn a lot from someone I don't know.\n\nThanks for reading if you did", "send_replies": true,

the three syllables-om tat sat-have been used to indicate the Supreme Absolute Truth \\[Brahman\\]. They were uttered by br\u0101hma\u1e47as while chanting Vedic hymns and during sacrifices, for the satisfaction of the Supreme.**\n\n**.**\n\n**.**\n\n**PURPORT**\n\n**.**\n\nIt has been explained that penance, sacrifice, charity and foods are divided into three categories: the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. But whether first class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned, contaminated by the material modes of nature. When they are aimed at the Supreme-om tat sat, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal-they become means for spiritual elevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an objective is indicated. These three words,om tat sat, particularly indicate the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the word om is always found.\n\n.\n\nOne who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not attain the Absolute Truth. He will get some temporary result, but not the ultimate end of life. The conclusion is that the performance of charities, sacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the modes of passion or ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality. The three words om tat sat are uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the Supreme Lord, e.g., om tad vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25. Whenever a Vedic hymn or the holy name of the Supreme Lord is uttered, om is added. This is the indication of Vedic literature. These three words are taken from Vedic hymns. Om ity etad brahma\u1e47o nedi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 n\u0101ma indicates the first goal. Then tattvamasi indicates the second goal. And sad eva saumya indicates the third goal. Combined they become om tat sat. Formerly when Brahm\u0101, the first created living entity, performed sacrifices, he spoke these three names of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The same principle holds by disciplic succession. So this hymn has great significance. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 recommends, therefore, that any work done should be done for om tat sat, or for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity, and sacrifice with these three words, he is acting in Kr\u1e63na consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a scientific execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return home, back to Godhead. There is no loss of energy in acting in such a transcendental way.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness ? How the different types of sacrifice, penance, charity etc can become means of spiritual elevation ?**\n\n**.**\n\n**Question 2 : FITB : Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 recommends, therefore, that any work done should be done for \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, or for the \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.**\n\n**Related Pic :** [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/23](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/23)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 52963, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 17.23", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566627942, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cu9yt1/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1723/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Friedcreamdream", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_13hyxh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566536980, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cu9a6x/every_day_when_i_wake_up_i_see_perimeters_lined/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cu9a6x", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cu9a6x/every_day_when_i_wake_up_i_see_perimeters_lined/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566536982, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve noticed it more than a few times because it\u2019s extremely prominent. i decided to take a picture of it today on my phone, I can see it through the camera however it doesn\u2019t \u201ccatch\u201d onto the photo.

I myself am an empath and through professional therapy this year I have discovered how to control it and turn it into something awesome!  \n\n\nSo what is an empath if you don't already know!  \n\n\nAn empath is a person who senses energies and pains amongst those around them. Its not just understanding others pains, but we literally feel the pain of others.\n\nWe are very affected by the energy and emotions of people around us. This allows us to be very attune to the needs of people around us. We end up giving up our energy to others very easily to either please or support those we feel in need.\n\nIts pretty incredible! Its not only people that we can tune into. We can pick up the energies from environments and even animals. Me personally I when I walk into a room or even in my office at work. I can sense the tension and stresses in others without them even verbally communicating it until later on in the day. Been able to use this to emotionally support others who box off their negative emotions.\n\nI cant even watch the news, as when there is a disaster on the TV or even a tragic incident or death. I physically and emotionally feel the pain and have to step out of the room. This can sometimes linger with me for a few days.\n\nI was convinced last year and the year before that it was a curse and I will go into more detail on that later!\n\nAs an empath its vital that we learn to block or shield ourselves from negative energies. This year I have been receiving professional help on how to do this. As I have the tendency of taking onboard, peoples bad emotions that I am surrounded by. \n\nI can instantly get a vibe from someone I meet for the 1st time. Feel their emotions, the good and the ugly. This makes us empaths very compassionate, considerate and truly understanding of others.\n\nThis makes us very affectionate, and makes us great listeners and councillors. A lot of people in professions such as therapists, doctors and other supportive jobs are empaths themselves. My the therapist included!\n\nWe end up attracting people who are in need of guidance or support. Which is awesome as I absolutely love helping others grow and succeed! But this can sometimes be dangerous as a lot of the time we make great sacrifices, including dismissing our own needs.\n\nEmpaths also have very gifted talents in creativity in most forms. I myself am a self taught VFX artist and film maker. I produce some very deep and trippy content.\n\nBut being an empath is not all fine and dandy. Its not a super power which some people think it is. We are not different or better in anyway shape or form! As I hear a lot of people say this about us... \n\nA lot of empaths decide to isolate themselves when they have soaked in too much negativity from others. Whether that's at work surrounded by negative colleagues, at home or even out in certain social environments.\n\nIt can be very overwhelming and confusing, especially when you don't know how to shield it all out. Alone time in a secluded space is needed so we can re centre our energy.\n\nNature is our best friend! And a lot of empaths find themselves drawn to the solitude and peacefulness of mother nature. It helps us recharge ourselves. Its odd even animals, as well as people get drawn into the warmth and supportiveness of an empath which is so cool!\n\nI did find myself before understanding this year how to control this aspect of myself, pulled down by a lot of negativity in those around me.\n\nI was in a very toxic relationship with a person who had struggled with depression and anxiety her whole life. It ended up destroying me over the course of 4 years as well as other factors.\n\nI didn't understand how to block out her pains and to stop myself from over worrying and supporting this woman with her struggles. I took onboard all of their pains, doubts, personal issues and negative views on life.\n\nThis person was not a bad person in the slightest. At least I believe she wasn't! I cant see an ounce of bad in anyone, as an empath we see the best in people even when they are not their best. \n\nStill love and care for the person to bits! Find out more about this experience in my recent post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/csxoyk/hey\\_guys\\_wanted\\_to\\_share\\_my\\_experience\\_with\\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/csxoyk/hey_guys_wanted_to_share_my_experience_with_a/)\n\nIt wasn't only the relationship pains I took onboard. But I also found myself in two very tough jobs where I was used and mistreated for my kind nature. I was emotionally used and abused and its taken a while to get over it all as the pains lingered for so long.\n\nMy last job my boss was horrible to me and recognised my nature to want to help and support. He'd guilt trip me into staying late, which id do as I thought I was helping but I was doing his work for him.\n\nAlways over heard him talking badly about me and saw him setting me up to fail. As being an empath we can see right through manipulation and lies. He knew I was onto him and would turn my own team mates against me in hopes to drive me out of the job.\n\nI ended up gathering enough evidence to put him out of the job. But doing such a nasty thing was just not in my nature. But all the abuse I would take home with me and it put me in a very dark place and I felt so used and like shit.\n\nMy mother was also dying and sadly passed away this year. All of it was so much to handle on my mind as I absorbed all of the pain and I couldn't find or figure out a way to escape it.\n\nWhich makes it dangerous for empaths as when you don't know how to protect yourself from such things the negativity and pains become you and it pulls you into depression if you are not careful! As I myself became the negativity and the pain that I was surrounded by.\n\nThis all happened for me from 2017 through the end of 2018. If you saw me then compared to my recovery now, you would barely recognise me.\n\nBut this year I was able to luckily escape it all. Sadly my relationship ended as my ex thought Id changed and wasn't myself during those years. Even my parents and friends thought the same of me and actually thought it was her giving me grief as they knew how much I was helping my ex. As it was so important to me and became my main priority....\n\nI also luckily landed my dream job. The people here are so kind, fun and just awesome! Their energies are so uplifting and positive and absorbing that has brought the very best out in me.  \n\n\nAlso attracted some awesome people into my life who are also super positive and highly spirited individuals. Feel this is so important for empaths to surround themselves with people as loving and caring as themselves. As it uplifts us on another level and brings out our best most beautiful version of us.\n\nBeen mastering being an empath and have created a blog called Gentle Gents. Where I support and help others going through tough times. Using the ability to feel and understand peoples pains in life. Whether its relationship issues, mental battles and general sadness, I find myself able to lift others up. Ive been helping many through this blog.  \n\n\nNow Ive learnt for the most part how to not absorb negative energies and emotions Im able to protect my own peace and happiness. Ive found such peace and enlightenment I cant even put it into words.  \n\n\nBut I just wanted to share my experience with being an empath in hopes to help others. And even help those who aren't understand how we work and function in life.\n\nBeen mastering being an empath and have created a blog called Gentle Gents. Where I support and help others going through tough times. Using the ability to feel and understand peoples pains in life. Whether its relationship issues, mental battles and general sadness, I find myself able to lift others up. I've been helping many through this blog.  \n\n\nBut guys if you are an empath or know someone who is one. Its not a curse, I know sometimes it can feel that way but it is a blessing!\n\nI've be able to turn it into a blessing and use it to help others. I always find myself seeing other suffering and feeling the need to be almost a hero in their life, someone to inspire them, help them and motivate them.\n\nFeel a lot of people don't get this about empaths. Is that we will go out of our way just to help you. We always see the best in people and want to help people achieve that! Even if we sacrifice a lot of ourselves to get people there. Seeing others reach happiness and fulfilment they seek brings us such joy.\n\nA lot of empaths really overwhelm themselves with this, as they just want to help everyone. We want to help the world if we could haha! t does come with a lot of guilt and anxiety when we cannot help a person or people and it can consume us. \n\nWe even sometimes find it hard being in crowded places. As we tap into the energies around us. I found myself being a victim of the anxiety that comes with it, but have been able to control it and enjoy any social situation and be confident in myself without tapping into peoples emotions.\n\nMy therapist did get me into a rather interesting exercise. Of putting myself in these crowded situations and observing the energies and vibes and learning how to block them out. Which helped me a bunch! \n\nWe put other peoples concerns before our own. We help others before we help ourselves. I would do this all the time throughout my life. And it didn't help me at all.\n\nI've learnt to put myself 1st but still help others. I've realised as an empath I can only help those to the best of my abilities after I've helped myself 1st. Which is what you fellow empaths need to also master if you haven't! Therapy and meditation and the alone time I mention previously all helps.\n\nBut don't feel guilty having your alone time. As we really need it to tune out of all we have absorbed. In those tough years I'd mentioned, I found myself closing up and away from friends, family and even my ex. Spending less time with them trying to understand why I was feeling so horrible and down.\n\nI will touch more into how I learnt how to put myself 1st and also how I learnt to control what energies and emotions I take on board.\n\nSo to all YOU EMPATHS! Don't be afraid of this side of you. Its a gift! We live more in our hearts and we are able to really help others so don't look at it as something bad. You can use it for amazing things and help others become their greatest versions... But make sure you become your best self 1st ;)\n\nMuch love and positivity to you all, and peace guys!

My mom pressured me into visiting my aunt and grandmother.  All the other people in their household are not effected by what my aunt is suffering from since scientifically it\u2019s not contagious, it\u2019s an autoimmune disease. \n\nWhen I stayed at my grandmothers home where my aunt lives, I noticed how mean my aunt was towards me for no reason. I told my mom that I felt unwelcomed by her. \n\nMy mom didn\u2019t care. Anyway within a few days, I started experiencing aches and pains very similar to what my aunt was experiencing amongst other things. I started becoming sick. \n\nMy aunt seemed happy about what was happening to me. She would gleefully point out how it was similar to what she was going through. \n I told my mom over the phone and my mom was being ignorant but eventually she allowed me to return because there were some lease paperwork\u2019s that needed my signatures. \n\n  Ever since that stay, I\u2019ve never been the same. Anytime my aunts health suffers badly, I experience what she\u2019s experiencing. I\u2019ve been to many doctors and they say nothing is showing up in my blood and yet they are unable to understand why I\u2019m going through such pains. I told them about my brief stay with my aunt. The doctors laughed it off and said it\u2019s impossible for someone\u2019s auto immune disease to pass on to another.  I\u2019ve also been having nightmares about my aunt and grandmother plotting against me. \n\n My mom grew worried and said that my aunt and grandmother always had a grudge against my mom growing up. They would humiliate my mom back then. But my mom said she thought they would have changed by now which wasn\u2019t the case. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do anymore, I suffer when my aunt suffers and when she\u2019s feeling fine, I feel fine. \nHow can I break this connection from her? \n\nAll of my other cousins that stay over at her place, are healthy.

Some months the \"draw\" to this person is stronger than other months. I feel like in the times where we don't feel as connected, it's because either of us is distracted by other things (love interests, career, etc).\n\nI'm so ready to accept this person into my life. I try not to search too hard, knowing they'll enter my life when they're meant to, but often feel frustrated that I have yet to meet them. I often find myself wondering what they're doing and if they feel this constant pull to me as well. I wonder about who they're with and what life lessons they're learning. When dating someone new, I often know fairly quickly in my heart if this new person is who I'm looking for, and break things off when I feel that they're not the person I'm looking for (usually there are other reasons for breaking things off too, I'm not *that* insane, lol). I have so much love already for this person, I've felt their presence for years and I'm so ready to accept them into my life.\n\nI guess I'm here to vent about my feelings to people who won't think I'm crazy, and wonder if anyone else has ever gone through this. And if there is anything I can be doing to nurture this feeling and/or help things blossom faster.

A overwhelming intense feeling of thankfulness. I also feel very Humbled yet with a great sense of confidence although I have a long way to go on my spiritual journey, I still acknowledge how far I have come. I think i am falling in love with the process. Please use a open mind and take a minute to get a little insight on my backstory. I have gone through many very traumatic events in my life ( as many of you may have experience as well ). I am the youngest of 5 siblings, grew up in a single parent poor family. Has had and still have very toxic family members, which i was mostly affected by those i lived with which were my mom, myself and my siblings. About 6 years ago i became pregnant and i remember being so excited yet nervous that i was actually going to go through the process of giving birth. At the same time i found out that i was going to have a beautiful baby girl was the same time i found out that my pregnancy would be high risk and complicated due to the fact that my baby girl heart was not fully developing and she would need open heart surgery soon after she was born. September 9th 2013 my beautiful baby girl was born, she later had a total of 3 open heart surgeries over the course of her for 4 years. In the midst of those four year i volunteered to taking in my new born nephew who was born a year after my daughter, then to later adopt him and raise him as my own child. There are many more details i would like to get into but maybe at some point I'll be able to write a book about my life and spiritual journey. As soon as these 2 children came into my life i realized my mission in this life. My purpose and my journey was much greater than myself. They have helped me grow in so many ways. They have came into my life for a reason and if it wasn't for them i wouldn't be here writing this right now, they always remind me of where i come from and where we all come from. Sometime i go into these thoughts feeling like life is working against me. All i see is obstacles and then i look at them and realize these obstacles are worth the reward and it's not always as bad as it seems. I am here for a reason. I have so much more learning to do and i am open to receive truth, light, love, blessings, understanding and peace. I didn't know where i was going with this just felt the urge to express. Throughout my low and high moments I'm learning balance, patience and appreciation. When you plant seeds of good deeds the universe will return it upon you. When and where you Lack, the universe will replenish you.

Who is a worthy person to receive charity ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** \"In the Vedic literature, charity given to a person engaged in spiritual activities is recommended. There is no recommendation for giving charity indiscriminately. Spiritual perfection is always a consideration. Therefore charity is recommended to be given at a place of pilgrimage and at lunar or solar eclipses or at the end of the month or to a qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a or a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava (devotee) or in temples. Such charities should be given without any consideration of return. Charity to the poor is sometimes given out of compassion, but if a poor man is not worth giving charity to, then there is no spiritual advancement. In other words, indiscriminate charity is not recommended in the Vedic literature.\"  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 17.20, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n**Relate Pic :**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/ctim90/qa\\_verse\\_no1720/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/ctim90/qa_verse_no1720/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 52659, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "QA : Verse no.17.20", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566488808, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ctimid/qa_verse_no1720/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "sarahluminary", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_31czg6ju", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566402410, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ctimg4/heart_opening_poem/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ctimg4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ctimg4/heart_opening_poem/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566402412, "score": 52, "selftext": "I haven\u2019t written a poem in years.

I am 28 and I am not happy  where I am to say the list.\n\n I commit many mistakes and despite all the advice given to me by family and friends, some part of me doesn't let the information sink in and I keep making errors  and continuing bad habits.\n\n It's gotten me to the point where I've damaged friendships and other relationships with people due to me being draining on them. I've been taking therapy but I've realized that I just vent there and get amped about changing myself but that energy just quickly goes away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat doesn't help is that I'm very clingy and have codependency issues  and my self-esteem and self-love is at an all time low. I've been told multiple times that I don't listen when i ask for advice and that I zone off. It's like something inside me doesn't want me to improve. It fills me with fear of failing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause of all this, every attempt at a relationship has failed me.  And just this week, a friend of mine had unfriended/blocked me on every form of communication we use because I had said something that came across judgmental about one of her flaws without thinking after one of my usual conversations that involved me lamenting AGAIN about my personal issues. I've been an emotional wreck about potentially losing her for good since because my codependency has made it so I feel high amounts of anxiety when someone decides to not communicate with me. the anxiety just causes me to cope in unhealthy ways\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not content with myself, I'm not happy here, and I can't even muster the energy to be a man of my word and actually enact change.

So there was many events in my life who put me in a total anger because i had to fully understand what it was to realize that it is not real. And every people I met who pissed me off, did it on purpose to make me feel what I thought it was and understand that it has nothing to do with reality. And they did because they love me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo every living matter of the Universe will make a journey to experience what God isn't to finally understand that this can't be and let place at what it is real as a thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne by one the conscience of every one awakes which is the point of letting go of the illusion that we are separated from the One, that we aren't the part of the same thing and finally bring the light as it is to this universe which isn't real yet because it feels separated from God.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe only can do that together, if one isn't in the picture, this won't work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo our mision is that one: experience everything that is not real to finally realize that it's fake and bring God to this place as unity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure it is very clear, my english is what it is but I could be more specific if needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy example : If you want to experience lack of justice, grief, all those things that are not real in a Kingdom of God you have to pretend first it is real with the help of all the friendly spirits you know and that will pretend to hate you or leave you to make you feel what it is not true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd when you'll understand that everything was fake until it ( except love which is acceptation ) you are awake and when you are awake you just have to wait for your bros and sis to awake in their time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's like feeding the universe with himself by the spirit that at times will become the Son of the One which is basically the Father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy doing this he's resolving the problem that can't be that there is a place where he isn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI fully remembered it yesterday because I let go of all the anger I had.

I was new to all of this at the time so everything I know is based on my own research from books and the internet. I didn\u2019t do all of this consistently but enough to understand the basics of energy, frequencies, etc. I was raised in a Catholic home but I never connected to the religion itself for many reasons. \n\nThrough all of my research, I have discovered so much about myself and have become a new person. Even those close to me have realized this. Finding my triggers, digging through trauma, and all the pain I have gone through was crucial to becoming my most authentic self. I understand that that I will most likely continue to experience pain as I work through all of it. I also understand  that I could easily stop this and go back to being my false self and live a life I\u2019m not happy with, or I could continue to grow and learn and live a fulfilling life. I am very aware of what sets me back just as I know what pushes me forward. \n\nBut, ever since the beginning of July (this year) I have been experiencing emotional turbulence. I can\u2019t seem to meditate and focus, whenever I read my affirmations I feel like they\u2019re useless, I pray but feel so disconnected when doing so. I read self help books and I retain the information for about a week then it\u2019s completely gone. By the end of the day I just feel guilty for knowing that I have the power to turn this around but my ego or something won\u2019t allow me to continue. It\u2019s like I know that something is so good for me and will allow me to grow and be a better person  yet I\u2019m stuck in the mindset I began with in 2018.  \n\nIt\u2019s as if I\u2019m in a standstill, maybe I have to heal something before I move on?

That is the big secret. More than just happiness or just sadness, what the mind wants is a sense of balance of the two overall. Balance is the source of peace of mind, though happiness or sadness can cover up our current state of peace of mind. So identify with your state of peace of mind and not happiness or sadness. Your peace of mind does not care about what you want to feel. It only cares about keeping the two poles in perfect balance. When you have more of either one, it doesn\u2019t matter which one you have more of: there is a lack of peace of mind, and that manifests the same regardless of too much happiness or sadness. But because of the desire for balance of the two, as opposed to wanting one more than the other, the unbalanced mind will ceaselessly seek to get that balance, no matter how it makes you feel. Seek neither to be happy, nor to be sad. But, feel whatever comes your way. Your mind knows best why it has you feeling the way it does. What matters to you regarding your mind is not your emotions, but your state of peace of mind. We have as a society come to put too much care into how we feel emotionally.

They are neither stable nor permanent.\n\n17.19: And those penances and austerities which are performed foolishly by means of obstinant self-torture, or to destroy or injure others, are said to be in the mode of ignorance.\n\nPURPORT\n\n17.18 : Sometimes penance and austerity are executed to attract people and receive honor, respect and worship from others. Persons in the mode of passion arrange to be worshiped by subordinates and let them wash their feet and offer riches. Such arrangements artificially made by the performance of penances are considered to be in the mode of passion. The results are temporary; they can be continued for some time, but they are not permanent.\n\n17.19: There are instances of foolish penance undertaken by demons like Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, who performed austere penances to become immortal and kill the demigods. He prayed to Brahm\u0101 for such things, but ultimately he was killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To undergo penances for something which is impossible is certainly in the mode of ignorance.\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 17.17-19, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/ct0lpv/qa\\_verse\\_no171719/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/ct0lpv/qa_verse_no171719/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 52432, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "QA : Verse no.17.17-19", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566400933, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ct0m00/qa_verse_no171719/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Themuffintree101", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_565wi", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566313835, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ct0fbq/dream_matrix_thread/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ct0fbq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ct0fbq/dream_matrix_thread/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566313838, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey folks, thought it could be quite interesting for us to share our own dreams, and create a kind of virtual dream matrix.

It was really windy with a blizzard and had to find shelter. We were trying to reach a McDonalds which was built inside an abandoned railway carriage. We were both layered up fighting against the elements to make it to the carriage. When we made it in, there were others, but they weren\u2019t serving food \u2013 Mcdonalds was closed.

I'm feeling kind of stuck at the moment.\n\nI started trying to live a more spiritual lifestyle a few months ago. Did some meditation, bought a few crystals and sage and really got into reading everything I could about crystal healing/spirituality/witchcraft. Honestly, within a few weeks of getting my crystals I had sorted a lot of things out that I had been putting off and made some big changes.\n\nI couldn't believe how quickly I had managed to get all this stuff done, some that I had put off for months. My anxiety wasn't half as bad and I was feeling better about myself than I had in ages. I also started seeing 11.11 everywhere. On the clock, on my phone. I even weighed myself and weighed 11.11 (I weigh in stones!). I really felt like I was on the right path.\n\nBut lately I feel stuck. I still feel better about myself, but I feel stuck on my \"path\". I no longer see 11.11 all the time, and I try meditating but sometimes I just can't focus and the more I try the more I lose interest. I feel like my whole spiritual journey has come to a stop just as I was starting to get into it. I read about people having all these amazing experiences, connecting with guardian angels and their higher selves, having visions during meditations, being able to see auras and read energy. I don't experience any of this. I have tried feeling the energy of my crystals but I don't think I can.

There is no recommendation for giving charity indiscriminately. Spiritual perfection is always a consideration. Therefore charity is recommended to be given at a place of pilgrimage and at lunar or solar eclipses or at the end of the month or to a qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47a or a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava (devotee) or in temples. Such charities should be given without any consideration of return. Charity to the poor is sometimes given out of compassion, but if a poor man is not worth giving charity to, then there is no spiritual advancement. In other words, indiscriminate charity is not recommended in the Vedic literature.  \n.  \n**Question 1 : What should be the main consideration behind giving charity ? Who is a worthy person to receive charity ?** \n\n**Related Pic :** [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/20](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/20)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 52379, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 17.20", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566369974, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cstv9k/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1720/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "galenpannan1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_11rj4r", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566283585, "crosspost_parent": "t3_cstod1", "crosspost_parent_list": [{"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "approved_at_utc": null, "approved_by": null, "archived": false, "author": "galenpannan1", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_11rj4r", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "category": null, "clicked": false, "content_categories": null, "contest_mode": false, "created": 1566310852.0, "created_utc": 1566282052.0, "discussion_type": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Soulnexus", "downs": 0, "edited": 1566283329.0, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "hidden": false, "hide_score": true, "id": "cstod1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "likes": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": null, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": null, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media": null, "media_embed": {}, "media_only": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_cstod1", "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 1, "num_reports": null, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "permalink": "/r/Soulnexus/comments/cstod1/soul_game_unveiled/", "pinned": false, "pwls": null, "quarantine": false, "removal_reason": null, "report_reasons": null, "saved": false, "score": 1, "secure_media": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "My life-experience is a little off I think.

It's not that I went crazy this summer it's just that I did the things that previously made me uncomfortable. I have no more anxiety and I'm happier than I've ever been just by saying screw it and living a less spiritual lifestyle.

I broke my pelvis in three places and have been in a wheelchair since then. This is a journey of growth via very quick and substantial change in my life. I am 16 years old and in a hospital full of adults. I have been in a wheelchair for weeks. The connection of this to spirituality is more of what I make of it, but I really just wanted to share. This has been extremely challenging for me mentally, having lost conscious in my home and then waking up in a hospital. The first 3 or 4 weeks I was depressed, but finally I managed to hold a brighter mood last week, then I was put on a new med for nerve damage, one that blocks your nerves from feeling moth physically and apparently mentally. In the past 2 days I have slowly continued to feel more empty and dull, having suicidal thoughts brought on by the feelings the meds gave. I\u2019m doing better now, still just feeling a bit dull. \n\nFor a spirituality aspect, I take this as one big test and lesson. I recognized that I had issues with listening to myself and with substance use before, but now I know to cut it out all together. The day I took the mushrooms I knew it was risky and I could have a bad time, but I never thought of something like this.  I have been broken, both physically and mentally, from this I get to rebuild.

I've learned about censorship, copyrights, lawsuits and practice far more consideration in the later years as well as accounting for my words.  Like calling a St. or Deity or a Godess Witch a cunt or other offense word, like a faggot, no offense.  It had been going on 10 years or so and I had various encounters and paranormal experiences, I was not delusional.  There were witnesses to some of these incidents and the status quo just continues, most people do not seem to want to hear it.  Bigotry, or dogma or ignorance or denial.  I am naive or gullible enough to try and humor people, people are mother fucking animals.  I do not understand why I seem to cross people as an arrogant prick or asylum seeker.  \n\nI shared some of my experiences and try to humor the military forums, I was just insulted, as well.  I understand the military would express confidentiality in such matters as well.  These kids though just post up the dumbest shit and I give them gold, they foiled my entire amusement in it.  \n\nI am experiencing some demoralization in this, I guess I'm done trying to humor people.  I do not understand or know why people react like this.  I understand there is dogma's and militant atheism and pain and chaos in this world, I am not trying to demoralize or shake people up.  It is just hard at times to keep all of this stuff to myself.  I am not a very religious person, I have modern views and reason and all.  It's not a system I would have believed in using, superstition, dogma, divine intervention.  I believe people need to be independent from such things.  I have a militant personality and sense of morale, I have an affinity for Norse/Germanic culture.  I mean, I would have been banished or lynched by now if it were back in the iron age, I suppose.  \n\nBut, I wouldn't have let things go this far or I would have had an easier time making a name for myself on the battlefield.  I'm confident I'm the biggest, baddest, mother fucker in the cosmos, jk..  My ego had also been destroyed throughout the course of this, which I don't mind, I only reference to ego in humor as it is.\n\nWriting is just therapeutic, I must think things through a little more though. I need to review my own work a few times before I post it on the internet, pissing off mobs of people.  Some people just called me out on drug use.  I had previously mentioned I do drink and practice some recreational drug use, cough medicine mostly, it's not really prohibited.  My alcohol and drug use is something I take seriously and never let affect me professionally or in my personal life, to the best of my abilities.  I only reference to it as an excuse in dry humor, I guess.  Cough medicine was an alternative to hashish and cannabis.  It's a little psycho-active, puts me in character, I love the shit.  There had been some incidents of me losing control - through aggravation.  I'm doing relatively well now days, I take account for my actions and try to practice more stoicism.  I usually just play video games, it's quite intense, I really enjoy it.\n\nSociopathy really started to take seed again.  During my tour in OIF and the military I had become a bit more of a sociopath, it was a coping mechanism.  After you get home you try and put the emotional spectrum back together, that just didn't work out, feeling is for pussies. \n\nI basically learning to deal with these things over time.  I'm slowly reaching the extent of my amusement and am just now letting the absurdity of all of these insults to me sink in. My comprehension of all of this is mind numbing, I'm sick of my brain trying to understand the stupidity and ignorance I experience.  I mean, I do not have a problem with most things, my mind's coping devices have been very impressive.  \n\nI was told to consider destroying people sense of reality or traumatizing them, I'm not trying to.  I am slowly starting to be less considerate and social about these things, in time I will not need to try.  It's brought me mostly anguish as it is, again, trying to humor people.  I tried to do the right things, I've told the authorities of all incidents, I told the truth entirely, I've been through psychiatry.  I was not delusional, or not entirely delusional.  There were public group experiences, people just didn't want to get involved or tuned it out.  They were seriously concerned with maintaining the status quo in town, very small, university town.  It's wasn't terribly hard to cope, I just still deal with being berated as delusional.  \n\nSo, you may understand this may all be quite frustrating.  I'm usually quite respectful and considerate, people are extremely rude and taunting to me.  It's a typical experience of a confrontational person being taunted by passive aggressive people, and I'm the one that is wrong when I lose my composure.  It's been very hard to maintain my composure amid people that constantly taunt and insult me, their logic is I'm the one that is wrong. I do not understand this type of society, I keep to myself and am generally respectful.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, I've reached affirmation in this.  Hopefully, I will soon no longer need to try and socialize these issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't fret, make merry, rejoice, dance, sing and train.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 52277, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Status Quo", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566331058, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/csmf26/status_quo/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "WalterHegoBook", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ebaiw14", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566244048, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/csm9rg/what_is_more_important_genuinenesshonesty_or_love/", "gildings": {}, "id": "csm9rg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 25, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/csm9rg/what_is_more_important_genuinenesshonesty_or_love/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566244050, "score": 1, "selftext": "Most of my friends, partners, family, and people I have met and known who manipulate, lie, and deceive and then seek to deny or/and deflect or/and cover it all up with \"but I love you\" are simply no good. \n\nIt is the few people who are honest, genuine human beings that I have found to be most worthy of my time, and their's mine.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 52275, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What is more important, Genuineness/Honesty or Love?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566330436, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/csm9rg/what_is_more_important_genuinenesshonesty_or_love/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "IntoTheLight43", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_169v2n", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566240673, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cslhj4/how_to_know_if_youve_met_your_twin_flame_and_why/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cslhj4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cslhj4/how_to_know_if_youve_met_your_twin_flame_and_why/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566240674, "score": 0, "selftext": "This was a difficult post to title, because there are so many things that could be said here. \n\nA twin flame is best explained like this: \n\nWhen your soul ascends high enough it's able to split into two and then incarnate in two different bodies at the same time.

I had an experience the other day and i wanted to talk to some people that may have experienced the same type of thing. I'm curious to know if it was my imagination or not. Anyways so here is what happened. \n\nI just pulled back into my driveway after a few hours of smoking some weed with my friends. I have been smoking since my 2nd year of HS so I don't get \\*that\\* type of high anymore, well at least not easily. You know where everything looks wavy and almost vibrating really or when you're really stoned and everything looks...different somehow. \"Comic book high\"  is the phrase my friends and i have  used to describe that feeling. Well i wasn't either of those type of high, just your everyday im pretty chief'd but i can function completely fine. I turned my car off and sat there for a little bit. I had been going through some things with my anxiety around this time so i was sitting there contemplating things. After awhile i started to notice i was hearing sounds. At first it was a faint buzzing. But as i listened closer the buzzing would come in and out. every couple seconds it would stop and then i would hear like..zoops and slow rising zaps. Like if someone was playing synth samples off an instrument. It wasn't necessarily musical. It was the sounds that i'd imagine you would hear when two machines are communicating with eachother. idk. Eventually i said to myself \" well this is pretty weird\" and decided to leave the car. I haven't heard silence like that since. I don't have tinnitus. Although i do get that one thing where it's like one of your ears blew out and you can't hear for a sec until it fades back in. That happens with relative frequency but it has been a few months to my memory. \n\nIf you have experienced something like this please let me know. I already look at the world as world of light where beings of light(us nd everything) interact with eachother through vibrations. I wonder if i was picking up on frequencies that are generally unnoticed. or a conversation? Who knows. anyways thanks for reading:)  gonna post this on the other spiritual sub reddits too", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 52250, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I heard through the silence", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566324967, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cskzmx/i_heard_through_the_silence/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "jstar1117", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3eaza61b", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566235992, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cskd50/opening_up_chakras_for_beginners/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cskd50", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cskd50/opening_up_chakras_for_beginners/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566235994, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hi all.

What is the best way to keep it satisfied ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** \"To make the mind austere is to detach it from sense gratification. It should be so trained that it can be always thinking of doing good for others. The best training for the mind is gravity in thought. One should not deviate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and must always avoid sense gratification. To purify one's nature is to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Satisfaction of the mind can be obtained only by taking the mind away from thoughts of sense enjoyment. The more we think of sense enjoyment, the more the mind becomes dissatisfied. In the present age we unnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for sense gratification, and so there is no possibility of the mind's becoming satisfied. The best course is to divert the mind to the Vedic literature, which is full of satisfying stories, as in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. One can take advantage of this knowledge and thus become purified.\"\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 17.16, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/csi40k/qa\\_verse\\_no1716/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/csi40k/qa_verse_no1716/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 52215, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "QA : Verse no.17.16", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566312765, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/csi4vm/qa_verse_no1716/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ethan-is-confused", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4bv0dqrr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566223116, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cshg1l/feeling_like_others_are_reading_my_thoughts_and/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cshg1l", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cshg1l/feeling_like_others_are_reading_my_thoughts_and/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566223117, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 52204, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Feeling like others are reading my thoughts and playing on them", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566309501, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cshg1l/feeling_like_others_are_reading_my_thoughts_and/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Lendu2", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_23xkzhj7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566222667, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cshcpr/will_i_make_peace_finally/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cshcpr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cshcpr/will_i_make_peace_finally/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566222669, "score": 3, "selftext": "Hey everyone! I'm hoping this community have some people who can help me answer something. \n\nI had a really good friend named Levi (we're both guys). We had a wonderful friendship, really good memories, we put faith and trust in each other. But at the beginning of July, after a few weeks of not communicating (actually, he didn't answer me anything..) he told me some pretty rough stuff. He insulted me, and all my trust was gone. That night, I tried to commit suicide. I even went to two psychologist for a few weeks, because I really needed help. We even worked together for two weeks in July with Levi, and he didn't even said hi to me. Please note, that we had really important moments with each other, and as much as I don't want to say this, he owes me a lot. I tried everything: angels, archangels, white magic, black magic, some demons, and of course, evident things too: a friend of mine tried to speak to him, but he didn't answer her too. \n\nI had so many readings, free and paid too, from diviners. Most of them said we will make peace. I will meet him on the 27th of August, maybe on the 28th too, and then, we will most likely never see each other, because we don't live in the same city. \n\nCan anyone give me some advice on insight, why is this happening? Do you think we will make peace anytime? I really miss my friend.

It\u2019s great to see that people aren\u2019t afraid to think beyond the current materialist paradigms\n\nBut I mean, what even is spirituality? Is it religion? Is it believing in sentient rocks? Is it just a fancy offshoot of Zen? Well, it could be all these things, or none of them. It means different things to different people, and that\u2019s what makes this community and spirituality in general a wholesome, quirky and accepting place.\n\nBut I while there are many facets, I think the most common unifying belief is that consciousness as we know it is more than the material of our brains.\n\nBut for those who really want something  to chow down, to guide, to enlighten, or even perhaps laugh at, I ask whoever wants to share material that has interested, enlightened, or even bewildered them to post the links on this post, or maybe just the name of the author and leave a description to help people understand what it is all about. Then I will try to organise into a nice list with sections for anyone new here or for people looking for material. Though naturally, there will be a massive crossover between the sections I\u2019ve chosen as they all overlap.\n\nThis will be a work in progress and I will appreciate all and any input from the community, thanks.\n\n# Pantheism/Oneness\n\n&gt;Law of One - [https://www.lawofone.info/](https://www.lawofone.info/) \\- The Law of One is pretty renown.

Persons in the mode of passion arrange to be worshiped by subordinates and let them wash their feet and offer riches. Such arrangements artificially made by the performance of penances are considered to be in the mode of passion. The results are temporary; they can be continued for some time, but they are not permanent.\n\n**17.19:** There are instances of foolish penance undertaken by demons like Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, who performed austere penances to become immortal and kill the demigods. He prayed to Brahm\u0101 for such things, but ultimately he was killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To undergo penances for something which is impossible is certainly in the mode of ignorance.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the three different kind of penance and austerities mentioned in the verse ?**\n\n**Question 2 : Those \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ which are performed in order \\_\\_\\_\\_ respect, honor and reverence are said to be in the \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/17-19](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/17-19)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 52136, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 17.17-19", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566279930, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cscuqy/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_171719/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Jakefsf7", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3lhdy2ik", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566189117, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/csc5vy/synchronicity/", "gildings": {}, "id": "csc5vy", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/csc5vy/synchronicity/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566189118, "score": 3, "selftext": "I went up recently to visit a friend of mine in Idaho.

Some of us are of a different evolutionary cloth than the others...  Blood and muscle is what some of us want to eat.  Rare, rare meat, at least, eating raw is taboo.

The body has reflexes, cooked foods is a new thing we're still getting used to.  The bacteria you're body may grow immunities too, like salmonella and ecoli.

I learnt from my beatific communiqu\u00e9 one answer, which is directly related to the preamble to this experience. It's the old adage, \"be careful what you ask for.\" Negativity. My old nemesis. A very simple answer. I learnt that according to Universal Law, this planet is based on duality. Hence negativity exists. When negativity no longer exists, one is no longer a resident of this planet as it presently works. The formula is for each of us to acknowledge the existence of this duality and then choose to disallow its existence to damage our individual paths. \n\n&gt;For each of us to instead use the negativity to help our awareness of the need for positive action, and to consciously work at infusing each of our lives with only the positive. In thus doing so, when each of us reaches this epitome of life, at some time in space, our planet will naturally shift from duality to understanding and living in unconditional love and harmony with all life, as we will have effectively removed the need for negativity.\"", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 52085, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Acknowledging duality and necessity of negativity, embracing positivity, and transcending the entire framework.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566275529, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cs8uzf/acknowledging_duality_and_necessity_of_negativity/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "glasswrldinvisible", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_407x2sy6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566168916, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cs8gb9/how_can_i_exit_autopilot_mode/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cs8gb9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cs8gb9/how_can_i_exit_autopilot_mode/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566168918, "score": 3, "selftext": "I\u2019m currently living a life where I\u2019m lazy, procrastinate, I avoid anything I\u2019m afraid of, don\u2019t do new things, isolate, distract myself from reality almost 25/7, and consume pointless information constantly..

If you have read any of my posts, you might know that I plan to rid the world of violence in my lifetime. This is not just an idea that popped into my head but a product of personal development over the last 5 years. In a search to find meaning in this life and return myself from crippling depression, I have been searching the depths of my mind, body and consciousness to understand who I am. I say this with the hope of conveying that I have been a non-violent person for sometime. \n\nThat said, I am working on plans to have people take an oath of non-violence. Taking this oath will be the gateway into a family that will end violence across the world and humanity. So, having all this in mind as I walked into the grocery store and I found that something had changed. I found myself comfortably looking everyone in the eyes and greeting everyone I meet. Now, I already practice this in my daily life but this was different. Saying to myself that I have take this oath of non-violence gave me a strength. It was almost as if who I am is standing on a foundation that is strong and firm. This oath removed the invisible walls that I used to feel when in public. It is empowering!\n\nMy son and I were talking about this and he mentioned that on an off-day when we are not feeling well, it is difficult to have someone look you in the eyes because it is almost like they can see you naked. As if you are unprepared to be seen because you, yourself do know who you are. This feeling I experienced, in the store, was the opposite. It allowed me to move with the freedom of knowing who I am and what I am about. \n\nI can now see how this movement is going to change the lives of the people involved. I am sure this is just the beginning of many changes to come. My best to all of you. Remember you are powerful, you have a purpose and you are enough right now!

However, a lot of people understand that they are good because they eat less desirable bugs like mosquitos.\nAn angel is described as a messenger of God. The first thing an angel says in scripture is usually not to be afraid. To someone reading and imagining the usual winged person this seems like an odd thing to say, but I think a lot of this is symbolism that can be taken from even if you aren't religious. (Hence me posting this here) One of the scariest things that can happen to you is being bestowed responsibility from the universe. Doing the right thing is taking the opportunities that the universe sends to you through subtle messages. Many can agree that although the expedient things to do are easier and more plentiful, like a mosquito it takes away from the essence of who you are like a temporary parasite, slowly eating away at you. To miss the opportunity of doing the right thing is squishing the spider, even though it could have eaten many mosquitos.\nDon't let mosquitos eat away at you because of fear, but open up to the responsibilities you could fulfill to become a better person.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 52053, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Angels are like spiders.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566274266, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cs6748/angels_are_like_spiders/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mattbraps", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_42vlv3hu", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566156738, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cs5uwv/approached_by_a_pastor/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cs5uwv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cs5uwv/approached_by_a_pastor/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566156739, "score": 1, "selftext": "i was walking and out of nowhere a man who claims he\u2019s a pastor began to almost praise me.

Through this process of identifying what we are not, we are left what we are- because fundamentally what we're all searching for doesn't lie outside of us, we are already that which we seek.  \n\n\nThis process of deduction was made famous by Sherlock Holmes, however this recognizing of the false will eventually lead each of us to the source of life itself. This I-ness, this sensation and feeling of me that we all share is but a window of awareness, a viewpoint for consciousness to observe itself.  \n\n\nIn this understanding, we can never define truth nor explain it, for we in the essence of what we are cannot look upon itself. It's like our own vision or senses. The ears cannot hear themselves, the eyes cannot look at themselves directly- they can however be directed towards something. That's the subtle, yet largest clue of our own experience. With our own consciousness we cannot look at ourselves like looking upon a mirror. We are a window of awareness, we are the witness and experiencer of life- therefore we can only know what we observe.  So when we determine those identities, conditionings, concepts/beliefs that we mistaken ourselves to be, logically we are only left with that which is original and true to us.   \n\n\nYou can't put your finger on what we all are, you can't show it to the world, but we can each discover our pure being through its aroma. Through the peace observed, through the silence and calm of nothingness, through the simple knowing that this is what we are. Spirituality is an amazing path, because its one that's self-created.   \n\n\nWe're our own subject of focus, we're our own student and teacher, we're our own chains of servitude and attachment- but we're also the keys to our liberation. I simply love life and this experience we get to discover ourselves, and although this journey can feel lonely just remember this: *Life is a play of itself, experiencing itself, trying to understand itself from a role of otherness. But it's still a game for One. Come to discover the source for your own I and be gifted with an inexpressible and profound trust, union, and love for life as life itself.*  \n\n\nWe're each unique and beautiful souls on a journey for self-realization and union with what we are- the eternal. Birth brings nothing but death, but through life we discover that what we call *me* never comes to an end. If you enjoy these words and find they've helped you along this path of understanding, every Sunday I host a [guided meditation](https://youtu.be/MENAYwzWxs4?t=2) exploring our truths and this process of unfoldment. If you vibe with it, give me a subscribe and join me next week. I'd love to build up a community of light and love with fellow seekers of truth!   \n\n\nI hope you have a great day.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 52043, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Path of Awakening- What We Are Not Reveals What We Are", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566273438, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cs4hih/the_path_of_awakening_what_we_are_not_reveals/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bangers132", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_13iwpqd1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566149444, "crosspost_parent": "t3_cs46ch", "crosspost_parent_list": [{"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "approved_at_utc": null, "approved_by": null, "archived": false, "author": "bangers132", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_13iwpqd1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "banned_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "category": null, "clicked": false, "content_categories": null, "contest_mode": false, "created": 1566178134.0, "created_utc": 1566149334.0, "discussion_type": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Meditation", "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "hidden": false, "hide_score": true, "id": "cs46ch", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "likes": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": null, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": null, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media": null, "media_embed": {}, "media_only": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_cs46ch", "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 2, "num_reports": null, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/Meditation/comments/cs46ch/fall_in_love_with_the_gender_youre_not_attracted/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "quarantine": false, "removal_reason": null, "report_reasons": null, "saved": false, "score": 0, "secure_media": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I am a gay male who is currently in love with a female.

He is wonderful but sometimes there are incidents where we get on each other's nerves. Yes, I know this is common for all relationships but there are times where I question whether or not I'm in the right one. Whenever I question this, I often get some sign of assurance or pointer that shows me I am in the right relationship. Recently, my boyfriend has been chatting with people online. Particularly this one guy who also has a boyfriend. \n\nThe strange thing about this is, I feel like my boyfriend is slipping away even though he shows and tells me how much he cares about me. It is as if this new party has created a disturbance or blockage of energies. He and this guy are forming an innocuous friendship. He sends him pictures of us together all the time and talks about me a lot to him. He even offered to have me join a group text with him but I declined because I don't want him to feel I don't trust him because I do 100%. Also, this person lives in New Zealand (we're in USA). I feel like the new party is kind of a test to see how strong our connection really is and also a way to punish me for taking my bf for granted at times. \n\nDo you think that could be the case? I am a spiritual person so I listen to signs from the universe all the time. I barely got any sleep last night because the energies have been so intense.

Of course, when a teacher speaks, he can speak the truth for the instruction of his students, but such a teacher should not speak to others who are not his students if he will agitate their minds. This is penance as far as talking is concerned. Besides that, one should not talk nonsense. When speaking in spiritual circles, one's statements must be upheld by the scriptures. One should at once quote from scriptural authority to back up what he is saying. At the same time, such talk should be very pleasurable to the ear. By such discussions, one may derive the highest benefit and elevate human society. There is a limitless stock of Vedic literature, and one should study this. This is called penance of speech.\"  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 17.15, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/cs2bty/qa\\_verse\\_no1715/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/cs2bty/qa_verse_no1715/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 52009, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "QA : Verse no.17.15", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566272438, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cs2c75/qa_verse_no1715/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "BenNCM", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5bavf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566139647, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cs22tg/listening_to_the_internal_signal/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cs22tg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cs22tg/listening_to_the_internal_signal/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566139650, "score": 3, "selftext": " What's interesting is that things start to go wrong when we begin making decisions and having intentions for ourselves.

It should be so trained that it can be always thinking of doing good for others. The best training for the mind is gravity in thought. One should not deviate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and must always avoid sense gratification. To purify one's nature is to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Satisfaction of the mind can be obtained only by taking the mind away from thoughts of sense enjoyment. The more we think of sense enjoyment, the more the mind becomes dissatisfied. In the present age we unnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for sense gratification, and so there is no possibility of the mind's becoming satisfied. The best course is to divert the mind to the Vedic literature, which is full of satisfying stories, as in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. One can take advantage of this knowledge and thus become purified. The mind should be devoid of duplicity, and one should think of the welfare of all. Silence means that one is always thinking of self-realization. The person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness observes perfect silence in this sense. Control of the mind means detaching the mind from sense enjoyment. One should be straightforward in his dealing and thereby purify his existence. All these qualities together constitute austerity in mental activities.\n\n**Question 1 : Why mind is always dissatisfied in the present age ? What is the best way to keep it satisfied ?**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/16](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/16)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 51959, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 17.16", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566270876, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/crz2f4/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1716/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "dabpendanny", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3ll91sgq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566117436, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cryse5/advice/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cryse5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cryse5/advice/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566117444, "score": 1, "selftext": "I wasn\u2019t sure where else to post this, but ok ppl here give good advice.

I also have a 3rd job as a part time replacement janitor at this children\u2019s music academy where I clean the inside for 1-2 hours Monday thru Friday between 6am-9am. I work usually closing shifts at Chik fil a everyday except for Monday and Thursday which is when I\u2019ll have my 2 art classes this semester. I have no problems with any of my 3 jobs and school conflicting. I only work at KFC once a week which is Sunday mornings. This works out perfectly since that\u2019s the one day Chik fil a is closed. \n\nThe problem is not my busy schedule but I\u2019m going to use that as my excuse to leave. 40% of the problem is when I randomly get asked to take orders at the front counter when I\u2019ve only been fully trained to do food prep work in the back and only somewhat shown how to use the register so I feel extremely uncomfortable with suddenly taking someone\u2019s order bc it takes me like 3 minutes to try and put together a simple combo like a bucket meal or one of the smaller meals. Then they always have coupons I don\u2019t even know how to put into the order so I always have to awkwardly tap on someone\u2019s shoulder who\u2019s working the line to help me with it. Like they could easily just be the ones to take the order bc they\u2019re standing right there next to the register and have worked there for years so they know everything about the menu and the new deals but just ask me to do it bc they don\u2019t feel like doing it. So they\u2019re literally standing there watching me from a few feet take forever to look for individual buttons on the screen when it would take them 10 seconds to do. I get extreme anxiety from doing things I know I\u2019m not good at when I have to act like I know what I\u2019m doing.\n\nAnyways, 60% of the problem is the bitch ass attitudes of the grown adults that work there. The teenagers/workers there that are my age are the nicest people I\u2019ve met there. The adults there have a ridiculously slim amount of patience and uncalled for attitudes. Like this one lady I work with who speaks mostly Spanish and has a super thick accent I can\u2019t understand sometimes will ask me to do something and I would immediately stop what I\u2019m doing to do what she\u2019s asking but bc I\u2019m new not exactly sure what she means or if I\u2019m doing it right and she\u2019ll be like \u201cWhat?? You don\u2019t understand??\u201d As she makes a face that looks like she\u2019s offended/confused. Another example is when one time she asked me to get 20 hot wings for an order and I asked her if I\u2019m putting it in the right sized box and she got all agitated, roll her eyes and grab the box from me and aggressively do it herself. She does this same thing anytime she asks me to do something for her and I ask her a simple question. Like why the fuck are you asking me to do something if you know you\u2019d rather do it your damn self. I\u2019m not the one who volunteered to do this. She\u2019s just setting herself up to get irritated for no reason.\n\nThen the shift manager is this girl in her late 20s that I knew was going to have an attitude when I started working there but before I use to think she\u2019d be nice. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt before judging anyone based on their appearance or first impressions. I told her once when getting to know her for the first time that I try to be nice to everyone and her reply is \u201cI don\u2019t really care for anyone.\u201d In my head I\u2019m like well damn ok then. Whenever I\u2019d be doing something \u201cwrong\u201d I guess she would treat me like as though I\u2019m getting on her last nerve and would give me a formal lecture like as though it\u2019s an intervention.\n\nI tried putting in my 2 weeks about 2 months ago using the excuse that schools coming up soon but the general manager (who\u2019s also got no patience/anger issues) convinced me to stay to work only Sunday\u2019s bc they need someone to do prep in the mornings. It didn\u2019t sound that bad to me since Sunday\u2019s are rarely busy so I agreed. I still hate working there. That one lady use to be the one to come in at 8am but bc I\u2019m here she gets to come in at 10am when we open. Yet she still gives me a dirty attitude. I tried to accept that that\u2019s just her personality bc she acts the same way to the other kids newer than me but really, if I\u2019m the reason you don\u2019t have to wake up early asf anymore at least treat me a little nicer. Taking me for granted.\n\nSo I realized that this job I only work 1 day a week for 8 hours is the only job that gives me bad vibes and I want to cut as much negativity out of my life as I can. Do you think I should tell them the reason I\u2019m leaving is bc I get too much anxiety from taking orders and I have 2 other jobs and I have school to worry about? \n\nMaybe I should just keep things short like my last 2 week notice. I just don\u2019t want them thinking they can convince me to stay again.

You can still the lake to a degree in this present experience or in this present  life. You must remember there is a portion of the spiritual cycle that is now in play. This is what might be referred to as a bridge segment of what most people refer to as the New Age or the Golden Age or the Age of Light. You are not fully into it yet, you are still in the bridge portion of it, and during this particular time, karma takes on a new aspect or as we have said in the past, the new karma, which means that you do not have to correct all your karmic debt from the past. What you must do to overcome the karmic picture that you have created and the need for any other reincarnations is simply live this life the best you can with what you have. It is not necessary to undergo the old practice of karma which is an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. In this bridge portion of the spiritual cycle, a new aspect has been added so that it is not necessary to wipe the slate completely clean. **What is required is make the effort to do so, and then forget about the rest. Now, this cannot be a one-time effort or a two-time effort. As you live the rest of your life, you must constantly try to do the best you can. Oh, there will be times when you just will not do it, but spiritual success is guaranteed to those who fall and will pick themselves back up. So, if you try and you fall back into old habits or old ways, do not stay there. Try again, start over, and keep this process up.** Then when you leave the material manifestation and you ask yourself, did you do the best you could?

Decided for some unknown reason to relax and breath and breath out.. Basically I got into this meditation without knowing why, or how. I also decided (something I have never done) to focuse all \"being\" into one point on my nose.\n\nIt was about here that I realized the steps I'd taken so far had happened completely involuntarily. So, what can you do? I focused more on this point. I felt like I was hell-bent to focuse everything I had and am and was into here, and.. Well. I think I did it.\n\nSuddenly the silence of my room was replaced by a huge, all-encompassing frequency and showers of golden light, I felt only vibrations and warmth and saw golden light, all coming from one point. And around that point lay a beautiful, cosmic-looking eye. I frequently use the eye as a symbol for the universe and unity and of course it's heavily tied to the third eye, but I don't want to jump to conclusions. All I know was that my girst thought when this \"explosion\" happened was \"WHAT THE- IS THIS UNITY? AM I THERE?\"\nIt was a pretty funny night.

This is why spiritual gurus who claim to know the One Truth are mistaken:\n\nThe concept of \u201cnothing\u201d is still a thing.

God is Everything. \n\nDoes it resonate with you to believe that God is a human like being that\u2019s male? Fine, then that\u2019s what he is. You prefer to think of God as energy? Fine, it is done.

I also posted this on r/Paranormal but I want a more spiritual discussion about it too since it seems very likely to be astral plane related??\n\n**The situation:**\n\n*February 5, 2019* The night of Trump's [State of the Union Address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYj4cDmilxc). My friend who is 21 stopped over to hang out in the suite I shared with roommates. I recently went on a date with her older sister so it was kind of, \"cool, now we know there's no sexual vibe between us so it's comfortable to chill late at night like this and drink\". It's the normal time-pass: we're talking about good things and bad things in life, and we put Trump's televised address on one of our phones as if it were one long meme.\n\n**Brief background:**\n\nTrying to respect her privacy, I'll only briefly mention that she has a history with psychiatric instability, of the possibly-bipolar nature or something similar, if I remember correctly.\n\n**The build-up:**\n\nBeing an attractive young woman and all, who values her reproductive freedom and all that, she drank pretty hard and pretty fast out of distaste for the circus that is American politics. We were having a good time, though, laughing a lot, etc. When I first got to know her, I had a crush on her (don't judge lol) so for weeks before this time, she (understandably) had a lot of resistance to trusting me or any masculine living being for that matter.\n\nAnyway, as the state of the union went on (and the alcohol opened her personality's floodgates), her inner rebellious femininity came out. By 2AM she was singing and dancing to [All That Jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utdFcen26FI) from Chicago, dancing around in a sultry way and singing in her vintage 1940's style she loves so much. She is an immaculate singer of this style and could win contests, and is one of those people you can swear time-travelled here from another era (the 1940's.)\n\n**The catalyst:**\n\nBy 3-4AM somewhere, she was *drunk*, fam. Like, completely slurring her words, falling over while trying to dance, trying to type into YouTube on my computer and literally just typing \"jawewae afp weh\" and thinking it was gonna get her a cool song to sing. I knew my suite mates were trying to sleep for classes the next day and I felt *terrible* but it's deep winter outside and she'd have to walk back to her dorm and there's no way I'm gonna make her leave and expose her to\u2014fitting the theme\u2014toxic masculinity that could be on the prowl.\n\nSo, she's almost unconscious, and I'm just tipsy. I personally have pretty bad anxiety, and my drunkenness mixed with how out of control I felt in this situation to give me a nocturnal panic attack (which basically just makes you tremble and shake for like 5-20 minutes.) I ran to the bathroom to try to shake it out but I heard her crash into something dancing around so I had to make sure she was taken care of while I was still violently shaking and teeth chattering.\n\nI finally admitted to my hardly-cognizant friend that I was having a panic attack and had to get under my covers on my bed to try to breathe it out. When this is happening, it feels like your world is literally ending, like a deep-rooted turmoil you can't put on pause.\n\nShe was sitting in my computer chair, facing away from me, while I was sideways behind her on my bed, clutching myself desperately trying to finish shaking, like this diagram:\n\n&lt;-HER \\] ||\\^ME\\^|| &lt;- bed\n\nShe is slurring her words beyond recognition, hardly aware of anything at all.\n\n**THE HAPPENING:**\n\nSuddenly, in crystal clear voice, still facing away from me she says\n\n\"Just breathe. It's okay.\"\n\nAnd other phrases that you hear a the beginning of most [guided meditations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS_iqfGjL78).\n\nShe at this point is literally giving me completely sober instructions to relax and breathe and calm down and etc, and while half of me was even more freaked out that she suddenly came \"back to life\" from what I was assuming was a blackout, the other half of me felt like her guiding voice was some kind of gift, and I just relaxed and tried to listen to her and go with it.\n\nAfter about 30 seconds she went on this ramble about me. The only phrases I can remember are that she said \"you're a good soul, Connor.\" and then something something despite \"your masculine deities.\" (likely referring to Christ, Buddha, etc.) So while that's all the literal words I remember (because this moment was profoundly bizarre and I was shooketh) the jist of what she was saying (in a crystal clear voice, steady-paced and 100% confident voice) was that I'll be okay and that I'm a good soul despite my masculinity and the masculine spiritual deities I believe in.\n\nShe then got up, fully coordinated, to come over to hold me and comfort me, saying \"it's okay\" type things over and over until my shakes finally subsided. By then, she was back into a strong drunkenness, but it was beginning to fade and she was less out of it.\n\nBy 5 AM, she was back up, wanting to go back to her place, but couldn't find her wallet. I helped her search for a while but was still really shooken up and didn't want her walking home drunk at that time in the snow anyway, so my anxiety was already spiking again. She eventually went to the bathroom and fell asleep sitting on the floor, so I came knocking, then she woke up, then she was with it enough to realize she needed to just sleep, so she slept on the couch and I went to bed for a few hours, and that was it for the night.\n\n**So, now, The Questions?**\n\nWHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED?!\n\nWas she channeling a divine feminine spirit?!\n\nWas it a possession?!\n\nDid her consciousness black out and allow her to become a channel for some paranormal guide or speaker or messenger?\n\nWhy does it just so happen that the theme of the entire night was about masculinity vs. femininity?\n\nIs that some sort of lesson I'm supposed to glean, spiritually speaking?\n\nWas this instead a byproduct of any mental instability my friend may have had and then it was just exacerbated by the drunkenness?\n\nIf so, how could she physically shift from being unable to even talk or type straight to suddenly giving me a guided meditation in a clear voice?\n\nAre there feminine deities who apparently think it's lame when a man like me believes in Jesus and similar \"masculine deities\"?\n\nIs the contempt my friend has for Trump, r\\*pe culture and all the other elements of toxic masculinity fuel for divine feminine beings to choose her to channel through, or a *result* of those beings using her for communication or something?\n\nIs there something else I'm not seeing? Or was I truly visited and guided in a time of need by a feminine goddess who spoke from inside my blackout drunk friend?\n\n**The follow up:**\n\nThe next day over text, I told her some of the details about what happened and she remembered *none* of anything past a certain point, not even the dancing to All That Jazz long before \"the happening\". She apologized for it and was embarrassed but didn't offer any explanation and didn't really seem freaked out, just apologized for any awkwardness and moved on.\n\nSo, what was this all about?

My Mom has it and it changed her as a person completely. From a devoted mother to someone who left my brothers and I alone for two weeks- me being the oldest to care for them at 12 my brothers were 8 and 7. She did a lot of questionable things and brought dangerous people into our lives. We were eventually adopted by other family members because she couldn't care for us. \n\nHuntington's has also turned my one Aunt into a very mean spirited person who has pushed away everyone in the family, cheated on her husband and made her children not want to be around her either. \n\n\n\nMy Mom is now in a degenerative state and can't talk, eat or walk and sits in a chair eating though a tube. \n\n\n\nSo my question is; what happens to a spirit in this case? My Mom wouldn't have done all those things she did if she did not have this disease. If karma is real, how does that work? She has obviously hurt people and done bad things, but how does that effect her? \n\nShe was on her death bed almost three years ago with pneumonia and MRSA. The only way to save her was giving her surgery to get a g-tube so she could continue to eat. We has a family meeting with my Aunts, Grandpa and my brothers to discuss what to do. The doctors basically said she wouldn't have much of a quality of life after. I knew she never wanted to be like that. She wouldn't want the surgery and she would have wanted to been put in palliative care - which my brothers and I pushed for. She was suicidal before many times trying to end her life so she didn't end up in the case which she is in. My one Aunt (who is also sick now) was very against her being put into palliative care and my other Aunt and Grandpa were on the fence. \n\nMy Mom's family is Native, my Mom raised us wiccan. My Grandpa did a bunch of traditional spiritual rituals to try and get some sort of 'sign' from my Mom that she wanted to pass. I prayed too. My Grandpa's girlfriend said she had some sort of dream about my Mom taking some children to an afterlife but honestly I feel like half the stuff she says is self righteous bullshit. She told me about how they were her babies that she lost because my Mom was 'so wicked' to her that is caused her to have a miscarriage. \n\nEither way. My Grandpa with my Aunt pressuring him decided to give my Mom the surgery. So now she is stuck here in limbo and has been for almost three years. \n\nI found out that I also have this disease now too. \n\nI worry about changing as a person and hurting my family and people that I love. I worry about being a bad person and hurting other people or making bad decisions that are not actually something I would do. \n\nThen I worry about my soul. Does it even exist? What sort of effect is there on a soul that has this disease? What will happen to my Mom when she dies? What part of her soul is even left now if she has one? \n\n\nI feel like... I used to be fairly spiritual. But not anymore. Now I just enjoy what I have at this time because I am not guaranteed anything else at all. \n\nWith all the evil in the world now I have lost all my faith. Donald Trump as president, famine in third world countries, people starving even in modern countires, our planet is dying and animals are treated like disposable diapers. The world is totally fucked. \n\nWhat I know I have is this life now and my choices I am given to make a difference. I think it's bullshit to live for an afterlife that isn't a guarantee. I want to see people afraid and repenting in the here and now. I want to see people worried about leaving a better life for the people and creatures after us. I want to see people appriciate the one true thing that we can see and feel supporting us and that is our mother earth.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 51835, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What Happens to a Spirit", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566267329, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/crrkr8/what_happens_to_a_spirit/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Rare_pube", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4bvf3kgu", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566070424, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/crqsf5/in_the_future_more_people_will_likely_adopt/", "gildings": {}, "id": "crqsf5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/crqsf5/in_the_future_more_people_will_likely_adopt/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566070426, "score": 11, "selftext": "It's good to see that many have already adopted this thinking because it is just as inclusive as the spirit in which we all come from is in relation to creation itself.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 51818, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "In the future more people will likely adopt spirituality and evolve beyond religion or use their religions as a guide as it was meant to be", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566266946, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/crqsf5/in_the_future_more_people_will_likely_adopt/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "VioletSPhinx", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2ok8lbxb", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566069873, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/crqo7j/abilities_surfacing_more_intense/", "gildings": {}, "id": "crqo7j", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/crqo7j/abilities_surfacing_more_intense/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566069874, "score": 3, "selftext": "I\u2019ve been testing being able to visualise where someone is who I know and am close to, this has tested positive.

There was a mutual understanding beyond words and bottomless love beyond gestures. I adopted her with my boyfriend at the time, and it coincided with the time of my life when I started to open up to spirituality, to myself in all essence. Since we adopted her together, we thought she was the \"child of our love\". Unfortunately, that love we had quickly faded and turned into an emotional torment, mixed with manipulation, resentment, anger, and abuse. She was the only thing still keeping us together, but it was for sure this beautiful kitty chose me as her companion - she was my soulmate.\n\nShe died a year ago in May, and it was the most heartbreaking thing that year besides the unraveling realization that my significant other doesn't love me (and maybe never did). Although I tried my best not to blame him on the top of our loss, but it was he who left the window open, he who didn't bother to take into account something that I had pleaded - to simply be careful. That day I wanted to break up and go, but he and his family convinced me not to. So I gave him another chance even after months of physical and emotional abuse, even after now that he had killed something I had loved so much. I tried my best to forgive.\n\nHowever, it was somewhat calming knowing that the spirit of Hyacinth would live on. Days after that, I meditated intensely on the idea of meeting her. I thanked her for everything she had done for me, and I asked the universe inside me - the eternity that unites us forever - will I have the chance to meet her in this life? And if that may not be fated, I asked her to teach me this one thing that she knows so well - unconditional love. Some two nights after that, just before waking up, I had a vision of an all-blurred-out Hyacinth relaxing on the floor in the sun, facing me. Unpronounced, but nevertheless strong was the message that I heard, or rather - felt: **Do** **everything** **with** **love**. I thought - ...but isn't it what I've always been trying to do?! And that's where we \"parted\". I began my path to heal.\n\nThe relationship with my bf got even worse. It was brutally cold now. We moved to a dark and damp apt, and I felt utterly alone. But one night I dreamt of grey kittens, and then forgot about that dream for a while. The other night I dreamt of a particular kitten. A grey kitten that I knew was a *she -* I was holding her in my hands right before me, and I had *never* felt such a strong feeling of love, *unconditional love*, in a dream before. My chest expanded with warmth and affection, and I felt a message from above, simply put: Hyacinth II. As I was holding her, absolutely taken over by her beauty that measured up to how beautiful Hyacinth was, I told to my bf in my dream - look, she has a lighter grey patch on her forehead. Hyacinth did, too, only she was a calico. I woke up in tears of happiness, and I thought it was so nice of her to have come by in my dream, but I wouldn't make anything more out of this. Later the *same day,* I get a message from a friend of mine who asks - hey, can you *please* consider adopting a kitten from me? I doubted I was ready yet, but I asked her to send some pictures. I thought I'd like a boy, but the only two available were this ginger boy and this... grey kitty girl. With a lighter grey patch on her forehead. Exactly like in my dream. *I had to take her.*\n\nI named her *Laima*, which in Latvian pagan mythology means the goddess of fate and fortune, and its derivation \"*laim\u012bgs\"* means happy and lucky. She is the sweetest and most beautiful and unique kitty ever, and since day one she has been keeping close by my side. Now, she moved everything for me, and in the right direction. It's because of her I had to move out, it's because of her I began writing again, it's because of her I finally got the courage to break off that toxic relationship, and move on. And when me and Laima both moved in with my best friend, and I was starting to love myself again, great things happened. Love has always been the driving force of my existence - I love what I do, I love people around me - but the last missing piece of attaining that unconditional love that I so wanted to learn from Hyacinth and Laima (she's the same soul, it's evident), was simply: **to love myself.** The universe rewarded me once I truly learned this.\n\nFast forward to yesterday's evening: I'm here, in a place I call my home for a while now, watching a movie with the love of my life. He is someone special, for sure. He who respects me and accepts me, understands me thoroughly, and loves me with all his heart, he who gives me something I had longed for all my life, an eternity maybe - and he feels the same way about me. And this adorable cat, our kitty - Laima - she's curled up in between us, and I feel so lucky to experience this serene moment. Now, both of my soulmates are sound asleep, and the movie is near the end. Laima, she looks so adorable, and that reminds me so often how much she means to me. I touch her gently right behind the ears, saying how much I love her, and suddenly I remember this vision I had forgotten for a while - where Hyacinth had told me the secret to unconditional love. Now all the pieces came together, and I was so very grateful that this is what life had in store for me, and I swore to myself that I will do my best to continue loving everything around me with all my heart. And by that I mean - loving myself with all my heart, because there's no difference between you and me - we're the same universe.\n\nI couldn't help but share this to someone, even if it's to no one particular. But to you - whoever is reading this - I'm sending all my love to you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 51735, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My cat passed away and this is how she returned to teach me the most important lesson of life", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566263517, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/crjjcd/my_cat_passed_away_and_this_is_how_she_returned/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "justinhurst144", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3f938q2k", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566029385, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/crjfx5/wake_up/", "gildings": {}, "id": "crjfx5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/crjfx5/wake_up/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566029386, "score": 0, "selftext": "To begin I never been vaccinated.

truthfully and beneficially and in avoiding speech that offends. One should also recite the Vedas regularly.**  \n.  \n.  \n**PURPORT**  \n.  \nOne should not speak in such a way as to agitate the minds of others. Of course, when a teacher speaks, he can speak the truth for the instruction of his students, but such a teacher should not speak to others who are not his students if he will agitate their minds. This is penance as far as talking is concerned. Besides that, one should not talk nonsense. When speaking in spiritual circles, one's statements must be upheld by the scriptures. One should at once quote from scriptural authority to back up what he is saying. At the same time, such talk should be very pleasurable to the ear. By such discussions, one may derive the highest benefit and elevate human society. There is a limitless stock of Vedic literature, and one should study this. This is called penance of speech.  \n.  \n**Question 1 : What is austerity of speech ?** \n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/15](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/15)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 51728, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 17.15", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566263276, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/crj0wk/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1715/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LancelotSupersadJr", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_i49ch", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566021533, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/crid38/the_definition_of_love/", "gildings": {}, "id": "crid38", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/crid38/the_definition_of_love/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566021550, "score": 1, "selftext": "I looked up the dictionary definition of love and was bothered.

appreciate if you could read this and share your thoughts, I can't talk with my real life friends about this kind of stuff. I keep everything to mylself and I'm anonymous here so here we go:**\n\nI am 18 years old, about to turn 19 and childhood was really bad for me. Seeing violence, being left alone, homeless, not having money for shit in a fucking developed country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was like 13 I was like fuck it I need to make money and started learning online, and realised I could scam people and rob their credit cards. I did for months with my 3 online friends and we made like 1000$/month each.\n\nThat was a lot to me as a 13-14 year old and I got so fucking paranoid that everytime my phone rang I would get a panic attack. Age 16 lead to xanax abuse and addiction because of anxiety.\n\nAge 17 I started setting up good investments with my money that I made illegally, and invested it in legal businesses and had about 40k. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this time still not feeling good at all. I'm really spiritual and would consider myself awakened or whatever. I've been into meditating &amp; thinking shit about our mind since I was a little kid because of my childhood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel devil inside. I sort of wanna end my life, but at the same time there is so much shit in the world. I have to accomplish some dreams. I have already, a lot more than many adults but still.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't love myself enough. I was just drinking with a friend on a bar, drank 2 beers and then just because I am so impulsive bought more Xanax. Now I'm just fucked up and still not feeling good.\n\nI feel like my friends are not the best for me. I feel like my life is so shit. I've been probably depressed since I was fucking 12, always evil thoughts in my head and sadness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do. Drugs are only a bandaid, but sober its so hard to deal with these feelings. And I just started at a new college, where I've been medicating with xanax as well (low doses however). Life has been great, but tomorrow I'm going to be sober. Then its all going to start again, bullshit of depression.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd. I have tried fucking everything. I excerise 3-4 times a week, eat healthy, drink water a shit ton. Just a healthy male.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like its a passion/dream I really need in order not to overdose on some shit. I don't see a point to live. I sort of hate people too, that's from my childhood too. I'm antisocial but not awkard, I don't wanna talk with people unless its important shit.\n\nAlways when I'm high these things come to my mind and I cry and cry before sleeping. Life is just a battle for me, like why me? But maybe its because I was made to be stronger than I am. That's my philosophy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just want the demons to go away some day, I fear they will never. I have done some bad things and still think about robbing people, I've even thought about killing a guy because he stole a lot of money from me. I'm just getting more evil by year and year. Socially I'm a normal happy guy, but yeah.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust a rant because I'm high.

I come from a Christian background but not a particularly dogmatic one. I've been dabbling in chakra work, crystal healing, and tarot divination for a long time now. But I always felt powerless, as if I were just a victim of fate and I had no say in the path of my life. That God had it laid out and I was stuck with it. I'm sure it's common in a lot of organized religions (or maybe not, I don't know), but in Christianity, there is a lot of \"finding your purpose\" and \"what God means for you to do\" types of platitudes that always rubbed me the wrong way. Why would we have a set purpose, when the entire concept of humanity is based on free will?\n\nI'm fairly fresh out of a 5 year relationship, so being single has given me a lot of time and space to develop my spirituality. I've done meditations, divination, crystal work, and lots of praying. And suddenly, I'm incredibly empowered.\n\nI don't feel like I'm living under the thumb of a specific god. I feel like I AM a god. Okay, I realize that sounds incredibly maniacal and egotistic. But I mean it in the sense that I am in control of myself. I can work towards the things I want. I can make my own choices based on my own logic and intuition, not the \"right vs wrong\" black and white thinking of Christianity. \n\nI'm not really sure where to go from here, however. My need-for-dogma side wants to find a community, some sort of named religion or belief system, that matches what I'm experiencing and feeling. A belief in the supernatural and in a creator, but not an oppressive or controlling one. A sense of self-power and the ability to influence our own lives without necessarily pleading for help from a higher power (although I'm all for asking for help, but not in the powerless sense). I also don't want this to go to my head, you know? I need to remain humble and realize that this world is not my own, that I am merely a visitor here and that there are outside forces that exist.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 51636, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Discovering my own power", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566260260, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/crcojz/discovering_my_own_power/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "forfreefun", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4cey1j7j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565989083, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/crcdsc/why_normal_people_so_opposed_to_spirituality/", "gildings": {}, "id": "crcdsc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 66, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/crcdsc/why_normal_people_so_opposed_to_spirituality/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565989108, "score": 79, "selftext": "Try mentioning anything spiritually related in any of the normal people subs (even ones like r/family, r/music...) prepare for immediate dislikes/downvotes/deletes...

He is tied to the tips of our minds.\n\n \n\n Imagine for a moment our Creator, whose true nature is pure benevolence, is now forced to witness and experience his Creations kill, torture, rape, and extort each other.\u00a0His lives as the slaughterer and the slaughtered, the bully and the bullied, the guilty and the innocent.\n\n \n\n For Him, it is a disaster.\n\n \n\n A majority of our world are living low-caliber lives mostly involved in fulfilling self-interests.\u00a0We chase pleasure, money, and other self-centered desires. \n\n \n\n But in our consciousness lie the keys to complete redemption for ourselves and the Creator who resides within us.\n\n \n\n Within our self-awareness, we can connect to the Creator\u2019s presence within us.\u00a0The secret lies within our thoughts and feelings.  We need to recognize the lies and falsehood that plague our minds.  The thoughts that lie to us, trying to convince us and lead us away from being ourselves.  We need to no longer let the lie live inside us and only be honest and sincere.\n\n \n\n It is an unbelievably simple:\u00a0Our good thought\u2019s come from our souls, the spark of the Creator within us.\u00a0\n\n \n\n Have you ever felt wholesomely well, happy, or blissfully content?\u00a0These are minute experiences of the Creator's true essence that we experienced.\n\n \n\n That inner goodness treasured within us is the warmth of our souls, the Creator living within us.\u00a0\n\n \n\n We must reveal the kindness of the Creator within ourselves and aid others in doing the same.\n\n \n\n By strengthening our inner connection to the Creator we give Him the power to express himself more within us and likewise through others. Our bodies are separated, but our souls are one.\n\n \n\n Through self-awareness and talking out loud to the Creator we verbalize His goodwill treasured within us.\u00a0Through verbal conversation, we free our minds from obstructions, fears, and come to positive and stable conclusions about our true desires in life.\n\n \n\n This conversation between a person and his Creator is a tried and tested method.\u00a0Rebbe Nachman of Breslov said that all the true Righteous people of previous generations who arrived at true knowledge of the Divine achieved these things through this simple method of personal conversation with the Creator.\n\n \n\n The key is an honest and straightforward conversation.\u00a0The Creator is closer to us than we can imagine, and he is not obscured from the clouds of nonsense that fill our minds.\u00a0He knows us better than we know ourselves, and He is with us.\n\n \n\n The only way to truly connect to Him is to talk to Him openly as one would talk to a best friend.\n\n \n\n One person\u2019s prayer might be:\n\n \u201cDear Creator, please hear me. Please reveal yourself to me.\u00a0I have always believed but never known what exactly to believe in.\u00a0I have been searching for the truth all my life but have never found definitive answers.\u00a0I simply want the truth.\u00a0I simply want to connect with you.\u00a0Please answer my prayers.\u201d\n\n \n\n Another person might say,\n\n \u201cDear God, please assist me.\u00a0I have made many mistakes in life that I truly regret.\u00a0I have been searching for a way to change my ways but at times it seems so hard and impossible.\u00a0I have fallen many times.\u00a0I am desperate for a solution.\u00a0Please help me.\u201d\n\n \n\n Every person\u2019s prayer is unique and only us as individuals have the power to pray our prayer\u2019s to the Creator.\n\n \n\n When we pray our prayers and dig deep within ourselves to express the emotions and desires hidden within us, we forge a connection and strengthen the Creator.\n\n \n\n You may be wondering if you read that right.\u00a0Strengthen the Creator?\u00a0Yes.\u00a0That is exactly what we do when we pray to the Creator with an honest heart.\n\n \n\n As we mentioned previously, the Creator is installed inside of us and all of Creation.\u00a0The way his greatness is revealed is through people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n While it is true that there have been righteous people throughout the generations who have taken it upon themselves to strengthen the Kingdom of Heaven, one look around at the state of the world and it is desperately obvious that much more needs to be done.\n\n \n\n The culmination of Creation is the Final Redemption.\u00a0In the Final Redemption, the divine spark within us will be fully revealed and a spiritual shift beyond the current reality will occur.\u00a0The world will be shifted to a higher existence.\n\n \n\n Our work today is to reveal that godly spark, our soul, the Creator\u2019s presence within us as much as we can.\u00a0By personal conversation and building ourselves, we create sturdy vessels that allow us to \u2018water\u2019 those around us and spread the inner search and expansion of consciousness.\n\n \n\n In the Talmud, it says the highest form of wisdom is kindness.\u00a0On a simple and practice level, people\u2019s lives can be changed and even sparked to the purpose of life from a simple positive interaction.\u00a0A simple conversation or even a few words in the proper measure can spark the soul of an honest person to seek for the truth.\n\n \n\n We must be aware of our surroundings and ourselves.\u00a0And operate in the world as a soul, surrounded by souls, on a mission to free our higher selves which is the completion of all souls.\n\n \n\n By being an honest and sincere person we inspire others to do the same.\u00a0There are enough \u2018fakers\u2019 in the world in all parts of life.\u00a0It is our mission to be \u2018real\u2019.\u00a0By being simple and real, we inspire others to do the same.\u00a0Simple honesty and truth will lead others one way or another to the ultimate truth, that there is no existence except the Creator.\n\n \n\n \n\n This article was written from the lectures of Rav Dror Moshe Cassouto.\u00a0All of

"score": 4, "selftext": "**TL;DR: I have been blessed with a lot of societal success in work, physical looks, relationships etc. But how do I handle this, the constant balance or battle between knowing yourself and your self-worth and falling into the pit of arrogance and ego-feeding. It seems like a very thin line.**\n\nI've had a pretty successful life so far. When I say success I mean a societal success. In other words I worked and earned a lot of money as a teenager, did well in sports, did well with females, had a lot of good friends, got my education (Information Technology) at the university straight after college, did well at work, got promotions and higher salaries, bought an apartment, was in very good physical shape etc. Basically I was the perfect member of society, and was praised a lot for it by everyone in my environment. Together with all these things I have been very blessed (or cursed) to, in societies view, have good looks. I didn't truly know my self but was basically projecting a huge confidence, which turned into arrogance.\n\nAfter a long time working 9-5 and spending my days with family, friends in my hometown, I started to realise that I wasn't happy, even though I \"had everything\". After a failed relationship with a girl I was chasing for a lot of years (I basically crashed miserably), I got into drugs and partying, stopped doing sports and working out, stopped hanging out with friends. I had the mentality of: \"This and that happened to me so the Universe owes me this and that.\"\n\nClose to burning myself out mentally, I decided to make a change and move to a new city and pursue something I have always wanted but was stopped by people around me to do: Arts. After some confusion and stress in the new city, I started to settle in and have since gotten, in my point of view, a lot further spiritually. Today I practice celibacy, am back in physically good shape, read a lot of non-fiction books on Buddhism, Taoism, Stoicism, meditate, journal, quit social media, do more arts, cold showers, intermittent fasting, cut down on chemical drugs etc. I've noticed that I have started to see and understand things about people I didn't notice before. Sometimes I feel like I can understand what people think, which I see in their behaviour them feeling undressed or naked when I look at them. People tell me that my energy has changed, that I am glowing etc. Life is really heading in the direction that I want it to, but I am in a constant battle. \n\nI believe that life is cyclical. Everything that has happened will happen again but in a different form. My ego is not as destructive as it once was, since I've gained the tools to not be self-conscious etc., but I feel that I've been here before in another way.\n\nI'm in constant battle with my ego, and my arrogance is piling up. A couple of months back I talked to myself in the mirror, and I knew that this was going to happen, that it would be a battle with an arrogant ego more than a self-destructive one. Also, lately I've noticed myself saying this more often: \"I know this is going to sound arrogant, but...\" I get arrogant because I see the way people look at me these days.

First He explains the austerities and penances practiced by the body. One should offer, or learn to offer, respect to God or to the demigods, the perfect, qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the spiritual master and superiors like father, mother or any person who is conversant with Vedic knowledge. These should be given proper respect. One should practice cleansing oneself externally and internally, and he should learn to become simple in behavior. He should not do anything which is not sanctioned by the scriptural injunction. He should not indulge in sex outside of married life, for sex is sanctioned in the scripture only in marriage, not otherwise. This is called celibacy. These are penances and austerities as far as the body is concerned.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the different kinds of austerities and penances ?**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/14](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/14)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 51529, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 17.14", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566255899, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cr3hss/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1714/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Tiny_mimikyuu", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_40br9e77", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565943073, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cr3con/black_moth_meaning_spider_meaning/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cr3con", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cr3con/black_moth_meaning_spider_meaning/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565943074, "score": 0, "selftext": "I saw a big pitch black moth in my bedroom on my wall when I sat down to work on my computer.

Which was very odd since it's never done that before, it usually stays in one place as I walk by (unless I get too close then it will dive for the nearest dark corner). So I looked up the meaning for spiders in room as well and death came up again as one of the possibilities. Yikes. I don't even get many bugs in the house in the first place....\n\nI'm not normally into this kind of stuff but these things were just so out of place and close together. Should I be worried?

I wanted to do a psychic protection meditation because I really want to start developing my psychic and spiritual abilities, and I want to be protected. So I meditated with my raw amethyst. I started by playing my singing bowl, and just closed my eyes. I was really trying to visualize a ball of energy but I'm honestly really bad at visualization and I'm really in tune with energy and vibes so I decided to stick with what I know. So I just meditated and it was kind of insane. Like I could feel my body, but it wasn't totally physical. It felt like my spiritual body was a wall and only my energy could permeate it. So I could sit within those confines, but also push out of it, without feeling anything come in. I've always felt like I was very spread out in the past when I've meditated bc I always wanted to reach out with my energy, but this time I was like, really able to control it. Like, I started by just feeling my energy for a while. And it was cool. It felt like waves almost, and it felt like my physical body was being very gently rocked by my energy. Almost like a pulse, but more like waves.  And then I experimented with moving me energy around my body. I found my third eye. Like legit. I've never really found it before. It felt like, my consciousness was behind my eyes, and when I raised it away from my physical eyes, it was right there.  It was weird too, cause I couldn't pinpoint it on my physical body but I could feel it. And then I experimented with sending my energy out, first laterally from the sides of my body, and then forward and behind me, which I think was harder almost. But sending it up through my crown took a lot of focus, so I did that for a while, and then worked on sending it down to my base, and then both at once. And then I was able to kind of feel like I created a sphere of energy around me by sending it out all at once, but I felt so grounded and controlled too. \n\nMy dudes, it was so rad. I've never been able to manipulate my energy in a way that is that controlled. And I haven't had a good meditative session while sober in a very long time. I was starting to worry that I couldn't do it unless I was high. I literally feel like my vibration is higher right now. Like my energy/consciousness is residing just above my physical form.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 51491, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Had one of the most profound meditative experiences I\u2019ve ever had.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566254752, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cr138a/had_one_of_the_most_profound_meditative/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lll-_-l", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3u0gm7un", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565928421, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cr136s/i_need_an_angel/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cr136s", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cr136s/i_need_an_angel/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565928422, "score": 1, "selftext": "Please come into my life!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 51491, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I need an angel...", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566254751, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cr136s/i_need_an_angel/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "water-boy_", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_19fuupwi", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565924864, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cr0gcq/cutting_toxic_people_out_of_your_life/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cr0gcq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cr0gcq/cutting_toxic_people_out_of_your_life/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565924865, "score": 7, "selftext": "After recent events in my life I\u2019ve cut ties with a couple people who I felt were hurting rather than helping me on my spiritual journey.

I was playing WWE 2K19 and I was coming up to the final battle, what I usually do if I feel like I can\u2019t win in a game or will need to give it my all, I look up at my cross and think of my grandfather and how much of a hero he was. But this time around was... different.. when I was finished I thought randomly \u201cwhy don\u2019t I meditate?\u201dso that\u2019s what I did, I held an Amethyst in my hands and closed my eyes as I focused. As the song began I felt.. an energy come around me, but it felt a bit.. muffled? But as soon as the song kicked in my eyes shot open as the muffled energy exploded around me, as I dropped the stone on my desk and began to play with pinpoint and precise movements.. my dodges were as quick as my attacks, and I thought only one thing \u201cI..Have to make him proud!...I HAVE TO BEAT AJ STYLES!!!\u201d I thought this to myself as I worked on instinct in fighting my foe, up until I was pinned and lost the match. When I realized I lost It felt like I fell from a sixty story building in three seconds, and the energy vanished. But as quickly as it felt like I tapped out of this energy and I had enough time to think \u201cI..los-..\u201d I couldn\u2019t even finish my thought as it kicked back in and I cut myself off with \u201cWould he really be proud if I stopped!?\u201d As I hit retry and a few seconds flew by in the match, I made the motion for a scream, but I didn\u2019t say a word.. I only felt a second time explosion of energy as all of my pride for my papa (grandpa) went into my task, I was in a trance to the point where I can\u2019t really remember what I did to win, the only thing I remember is that with what seemed within the blink of an eye, I heard the referee counting as I had my enemy pinned, as I had won the match.. I did two more things afterwards that were out of my control, one was jump out of my chair with my arms in the air out of celebration, but I held a perfectly blank expression, as I looked at my cross and nodded, almost thanking my grandfather, whilst the antagonist of the game admits his defeat shaking my characters hand, awarding me the universal title belt, as confetti fell and my character celebrated. Soon after the energy from my transformation faded, and I returned to normal being left a bit clueless. The first bout of it was a flow state I know that much, but.. when my soul had screamed and the second explosion came? I wish I could tell you what happened but for the life of me I can\u2019t figure out what it is that happened to invoke such a powerfully no-minded concentration and transformation, or exactly WHAT it was.. everyone that I\u2019ve told the story has either been in awe, or has said things about where fate may take me, even going as far as saying that because it\u2019s an ability invoked by me, and believed to be something only I could do, it may lead to me becoming some sort of hero.

It's obvious that everything these chakras\u00a0represent\u00a0are\u00a0absent in my life.\u00a0\n\nOn the other hand, I can more resonate with the upper 6th and 7th chakras that aren't so much about the material world.

I had started my Ceremony by fasting  the previous night going into the next day, nothing to eat for around 18  hours, only drinking water, the day finally arrives I have a bunch of  fresh lemonade, and a full vape charge with a brand new cartridge of  weed on it. 9PM rolls around, I eat the 8 grams dried and chase it with  the fresh lemonade, twenty minutes in my stomach is already in pain due  to the fasting, I feel wobbly and decide to close all the lights and  meditate in the middle of my pitch black room.\n\nAbout  ten or twenty minutes afterwards I started to viciously smoke the weed,  as I was fading fast and starting to believe if I didn't smoke out soon  I would be physically incapable of it later. Six or Seven large hits  into the weed pen I got a sharp deja vu, looking over my shoulder I'm no  longer in a dark room and hear a very loud ringing echoing through my  skull, it was absolutely piercing, I notice the room is completely lit  up and loads of my family/friends are filling it laughing at me.\n\n\"Look  at this idiot, high out of his mind, he has done it now, he is insane\"  My deceased father screamed as the rest of them were cackling at me,  they were slowly encroaching towards me, attempting to convince me that  all of my experiences and perceptions of the previous life I lead was a  lie, and I had fabricated it and was actually a mental patient, as they  were chanting for me to take my own life I closed my eyes and focused on  the ringing which was reaching increasing decibel by decibel at a rapid  rate.\n\nClosing my eyes focusing on  it, I could feel a wave go through me, it felt wet as water, upon  opening my eyes there were waves of crimson blood splashing around and I  was in a sea of crimson blood, everybody has dissipated it was at this  moment upon seeing the sea of crimson blood I fell backwards and shot  out of my body, breathing, twisting, churning, through a this portal of  life &amp; death, comforting, repeatable, I end up in a grassy field  full of seemingly ancient runes, symbols, with light creatures showing  me amalgamated machines transfused with blood, organs, metal, with  seemingly infinite energy spewing out of them, I was not in the mood to  see any machines after the run-up to this event, I felt as though my  soul was covered in crimson blood and I was going to push forward,  ignoring the entities and their creations I moved forward unto a field  of endless doors, all the same color, knowing I would not have time to  search them all I started concentrating and one revealed its self within  that same crimson red color, a red door awaiting. It was at this point I  could almost feel the entities playful spirit flip, the gravity within  that place seemed to amplify greatly, it was as if they figured out I  was no longer interested in their parlor tricks and figured out which  door was needed to push towards the higher dimensions, it was as if they  existed to protect/distract from something and their job was  compromised.\n\nThere was an  overwhelming sense of disappointment but I passed freely though the  gravity felt immense I trudged forward, infused with anger and hatred I  entered the next room greeted by Jesters, They were jumping into me as I  float there rattling off horrifying sounds as they entered and exited,  it felt like they were taking pieces of me out and it was an immediate  attack, as I float there bound by the weight of what must be a gravity  well, they tortured me, I cried and pleaded to go forward to no avail,  eventually I started to will them away, as they would jump to go inside  of me I would will them to bounce backwards before entering, I got a  huge kick out of this and a second lease on attempting to push forward I  started moving forward, but every time I would get closer I would get  lower into the ground to the point I was breaking earth underneath my  soul as that cackled and laughed from above, I saw a field of giant  skulls with fangs and horns, dragon heads? snake heads? no clue one of  them was red and I had an overwhelming determination and understanding  to reach that crimson red skull in order to go forward, stuck in the  ground I contemplated how I could even gain an inch towards it though, I  stopped observing and started to anticipate the Jesters above me and I  started to explode them, shrieking and exploding they scattered like  rats, it felt as if the gravity well was lifted and I was rapidly moving  towards the red skull, upon reaching it I started observing again,  seeing the absolute carnage of exploded jesters littering the canvas, I  noticed some of the Jesters hiding behind Five-Dimensional rotating  objects (something like the previous ones were creating) I could see the  top of their masks popping out, and in the distance behind a lava field  in the grey and red sky I saw a pair of red eyes super imposed.\n\nInteresting  but as I entered into the next lair the scene flipped, it was bright  beautiful lights, angelic if you wish. Immediately I stopped observing  after the initial observation and started to scan for anything  attempting to explode it to which I was met with being forced to observe  again, as hard as I tried to \"close my eyes?\" or stop observing I  couldn't something was forcing me to view, and forcing a mental loop, I  was stuck in place staring at the ground and a shadow of a winged  creature flying over me started speaking. \"You will pay me your debt.\" a  deep echoing voice from above, as I stare at its shadow begging my mind  to explode it so I can move forward, to which it felt like the creature  invaded every inch of my consciousness and screamed out loud, \"You will  look no further, you will sit here and stare at my shadow\" after what  felt like an eternity of being bound to staring at a shadow I came to in  my room completely naked sitting with my legs crossed, and my cloths  neatly folded on a chair with the marijuana vape on top of it, this was  immediately written there after, as the next four hours I went through  it again and again trying to make sense of it.\n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false,

"selftext": "Okay, the title was a bit of an attention grabber since my opinion is more nuanced than that. I believe that every soul is in need of knowing what they truly are, and in that sense there's really no difference between oppressed people and not. You could even say that within the society that we live in, each of us is oppressed from our full spiritual potential. But it's clear that systemic oppression affects some much more than others, and there is my point. \n\nSo much of the conversation is focused purely on societal equality, which is enormously important as a group, but on the individual level I feel that it misses something essential. An oppressed person has only ever been told their place as a *human*, as part of a larger system which governs itself. Within this system, they are told that they are worth less than others, that their souls aren't equal to those of the rulers. The truth is that in one lifetime these people will never be elevated to a sense of equality within that system. However, society is not the dictator of true worth (nor will it ever be). By putting the emphasis on humanity to make this shift in the first place, we place power where it does not exist. This gives a false sense of promise (that humanity could ever raise the worth of a soul), and places a ceiling on how much worth a human can have (only as much as its system allows them). Those who have already begun to understand spirituality know that this isn't near the case, and that the limits to human worth are as infinite as the realm of existence they've found themselves in. \n\nWhat I propose isn't that we stop the conversation on societal equality at all. I simply feel that true freedom for those who feel the weight of that society doesn't exist within the confines of said society. If one's entire human existence is going to be limited by the views of their neighbors, then they must turn to the transcendental, to the \"more-than-human\". A friend and I were arguing about this, their understanding being that such an opinion was invalidating of those who's identities are tied to their culture, such as racial minorities or LGBT folk. In reply I proposed that by understanding their identity only as it is acknowledged by others, they were only hurting themselves. As long as society is holding up a mirror and telling them what to see they will not know themselves. To access spirituality is not to kill your \"blackness\" or \"queerness\", but only to re-contextualize those labels in the universal scheme. \n\nThe goal is to take away the power to assign worth from human institutions.

In the present time we so often hear that it is impossible to gain knowledge of certain things \u2014 that our capacity for knowledge has limits and cannot rise above a certain height. On becoming acquainted with modern philosophical research we constantly hear of such limits to knowledge, especially among those schools of philosophy which owe their origin to Kant. The understanding of anthroposophists and of those who practice mysticism is distinguished from all such doctrines through never setting limits to man's capacity for knowledge, but rather looking upon it as capable of being both widened and uplifted. Is it not, to a certain extent, the greatest arrogance for anyone to regard his own capacity for knowledge, from the point at which it stands, as something decisive, and then to say that with our capacities we cannot go beyond definite limits of knowledge? The anthroposophist says: \u201cI stand today at a certain point in human knowledge, from which I am able to know certain things and not others. But it is possible to cultivate the human capacity for knowledge, to heighten it.\u201d What is called a school of initiation has as its essential aim to raise to a higher stage this human capacity for knowledge. So it is quite correct if one from a lower stage of knowledge says that there are limits to his knowledge and that certain things cannot be known. One can, however, raise oneself above this stage of knowledge and press on to a higher stage, so that it becomes possible to know what at a lower stage was impossible. This is the essence of initiation, and this deepening or heightening of knowledge is the task of the initiation schools. This means raising man to a stage of knowledge to which nature has not brought him, but which he must acquire for himself through long years of patient exercise.\n\nIn all ages there have been these initiation schools. Among all peoples, those having a higher kind of knowledge have arisen from these initiation schools. And the essential nature of such schools \u2014 and of the great Initiates themselves, who have soared above the lower stages of the human capacity for knowledge and, through their inspirations, have been acquainted with the highest knowledge accessible to us in this world \u2014 finds expression in Initiates giving to the various peoples on earth their various religions and world-conceptions.\n\nToday we wish with a few strokes to illuminate the essential being of these great Initiates. As in every science, in every spiritual process one must first learn the method through which one penetrates to knowledge. This is also the case in the initiation schools. And here too it is a matter of our being led through certain methods to the higher stages of knowledge, about which we have spoken precisely. I shall now briefly refer to the stages that here concern us. Certain stages of knowledge can only be attained in the intimate schools of initiation where there are teachers who have themselves in their own experience gone through each school, have devoted themselves to every exercise, and have really pondered every single step, every single stage. And one must entrust oneself only to such teachers in the initiation schools.\n\nIn these schools there is, it is true, no hint of authority, nothing that smacks of dogmatism; the governing principle is entirely that of counsel, the imparting of advice. Whoever has gone through a certain stage of learning, and has himself acquired experiences of the higher, super-sensible life, knows the inner way that leads to this higher knowledge. And it is only one such as this who is qualified to say what one must do. What is necessary is simply that there be trust between pupil and teacher in this sphere. Whoever lacks this trust can learn nothing; but whoever has it will very soon perceive that nothing is recommended by any occult, mystic, or mystery teacher other than what the teacher has himself gone through. What concerns us here is that, of the whole being of man as he stands before us today, it is essentially only the outward visible part already within human nature that is today complete. This must be made clear to anyone aspiring to become a student of the mysteries \u2014 that man as he stands before us today is by no means a completed being, but is in the process of developing so that in the future he will reach many higher stages.\n\nThat which today has attained to an image of God, that which has arrived at the highest stage in man, is the human physical body, that which we can see with our eyes and perceive in any way with our senses. That is not, however, the only thing that man has. He has still higher members of his nature. To begin with, he further possesses a member that we call his etheric body. This etheric body can be seen by anyone who has cultivated his soul organs. Through this etheric body man is not simply a creation in which work chemical and physical forces, but a living creation, a creation that lives and is endowed with capacities for growth, life, and propagation. One can see this etheric body, which represents a kind of archetype of man, if, with the methods of the art of clairvoyance \u2014 which will be characterized still further \u2014 one suggests away the ordinary physical body. You know how, by the ordinary methods of hypnotism and suggestion, the point can be reached when, if you say to anyone that there is no lamp here, he actually sees no lamp. So you can also, if you develop in yourself sufficiently strong willpower \u2014 a willpower that shuts out, entirely shuts out, all observation of the physical body \u2014 so you can, in spite of seeing into space, completely suggest away physical space. Then you see space not empty but filled by a kind of archetype. This archetype has practically the same form as the physical body. It is, however, not of the same nature through and through, but is fully organized. It is not only interlaced with fine veins and streams but it also has organs. This creation, this etheric body, produces man's essential life. Its color can only be compared with the color of the young peach blossom. It is no color that is contained in the sun spectrum; but it is something between a violet and a reddish tinge. This is then the second body.\n\nThe third body is the aura, which I have often described \u2014 that cloudlike formation of which I spoke last time when describing man's origin, in which man is as if in an egg-shaped cloud. In this is expressed all that lives in man as lust, passion, and feeling. Joyful self-sacrificing feelings express themselves in this aura in luminous streams of color. Feelings of hate, physical feelings, express themselves in dark color tones. Sharp, logical thoughts express themselves in sharply outlined forms. Illogical, confused thoughts come to expression in figures with blurred outline. Thus, we have in this aura an image of what is living in man's soul as feeling, passion, and impulse.\n\nAs man has now been described, so he was set down on the earth \u2014 from the hand of nature, so to speak \u2014 at the point of time that lies approximately at the beginning of the Atlantean race. Last time I described what is to be understood by \u201cthe Atlantean race.\u201d At the moment when the fertilization by the eternal spirit had already taken place, man confronts us with the three members \u2014 body, soul, and spirit. Today this threefold nature of man has taken a somewhat different form, as since that time, since nature has released him, since he has become a being with self-consciousness, man has worked on his own being. This work on himself means the refining of his aura; it also means sending light into the aura out of this self-consciousness. A man who stands at a very low stage of development and has never worked on himself \u2014 let us say a savage \u2014 has the aura which nature has provided him. But all those within our civilization, our cultural world, have auras on which they themselves have helped to work, for in so far as man is a self-conscious being he works upon himself and this work comes into expression first through changing his aura. All that man has learned through nature, all that he has absorbed since he was able to speak and think self-consciously, is a recent acquisition in his aura brought about by his own activity.\n\nIf you put yourself back into the Lemurian age, in which man had already had warm blood flowing in his veins for some time, and in which, in the middle of this Lemurian age, his fertilization with the spirit had taken place, man then was not yet a being capable of clear thinking. All this occurred at the beginning of evolution when the spirit had just taken possession of the corporeality. At that time the aura was still completely a consequence of forces of nature. One could then perceive \u2014 as one still can with men at a very low stage of development \u2014 how at a certain place in the interior of the head (that is to say, a place that we have to seek in the interior of the head) there exists a smaller aura of a bluish color. This smaller aura is the outer auric expression of the self-consciousness. And the more a man has developed this self-consciousness through his thought and through his work, the more this smaller aura spreads itself over the other, so that often in a short time both become totally different. A man who lives in outer culture, a refined man of culture, works on his aura in the particular way that this culture impels him. Our ordinary knowledge, which they offer in our schools, our experiences that life brings us, are absorbed by us and they are perpetually transforming our aura. But this transformation must be continuous if a man wishes to enter into practical mysticism. Then he must make a special effort to work upon himself. For then he must not incorporate into his aura only what culture offers him, but must exercise an influence upon it in a definite, orderly manner. And this happens through so-called meditation. This meditation, this inner immersion, is the first stage which a student of initiation must undergo.\n\nNow in what does this meditation take an interest? Just try to bring to mind and reflect upon the thoughts that you shelter from morning to night, and upon how these thoughts are influenced by the time and the place in which you live. See whether you can hinder your thoughts, and ask yourself whether you would have them if you did not happen by chance to be living in Berlin at the beginning of the twentieth century. At the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth centuries, men did not think in the same way as men do today. If you consider how the world has changed in the course of the last century, and what kind of changes time has brought about, you will see that what passes through your soul from morning to night is dependent upon time and space. It is different when we give ourselves up to thoughts that have an eternal worth. Actually it is only certain abstract, scientific thoughts to which men have given themselves up, the highest thoughts of mathematics and geometry, that have an eternal worth. Twice two is four holds good at all times and in all places. It is the same with the geometrical truths that we accept. But leaving aside a certain fundamental stock of such truths, we may say that the average man has very few thoughts that are not dependent on time and space. What is thus dependent unites us with the world, and only exerts a trifling influence upon that essence which is in itself enduring.\n\nMeditation means nothing other than surrendering oneself to thoughts which have eternal worth, in order to raise oneself up in a conscious way to what lies above both space and time. Such thoughts are contained in the great religious writings: the Vedanta, the Bhagavad Gita, the Gospel of John from the thirteenth chapter to the end, and the \u201cImitation of Christ,\u201d by Thomas a Kempis. He who sinks himself with patience and perseverance so that he lives in such writings; he who deepens himself anew every day \u2014 perhaps working for weeks on one single sentence, thinking it through, feeling it through \u2014 will gain unlimited benefit. Just as each day one learns more nearly to know and love a child with all its individual characteristics, so one can daily draw into one's soul an eternal truth of the kind that flows from the great Initiates, or from inspired men. This has the effect of filling us with new life. Very significant also are the sayings in the \u201cLight on the Path\u201d that have been written down by Mabel Collins, under the instruction of higher powers. Actually in the first four sentences there is something that, when applied with patience in the appropriate way, is capable of so seizing upon man's aura that this aura is completely shot through with new light. One can see this light in the human aura shining and glistening. Bluish shades arise in the place of the reddish or of the reddish\u00a0brown shimmering shades of color, and, in the place of yellow, clear reddish ones arise, and so on. The whole coloring of the aura transforms itself under the influence of such eternal thoughts. The student cannot yet perceive this in the beginning, but he gradually begins to notice the deep influence that emanates from the greatly transformed aura.\n\nIf a man, in addition to these meditations, consciously and in a most scrupulous way practices certain virtues, certain achievements of the soul, then, within this aura, his sense-organs of the soul develop. We must have these if we want to see into the soul-world, just as we must have physical sense-organs to be able to see into the material world. As the outer senses were planted into the body by nature, so must man, in a regular way, implant the higher sense-organs of the soul into his aura. Meditation leads man to become ripe from within outwards, forming, developing, and interweaving the available capacities of the soul's senses.\n\nBut if we wish to cultivate these sense organs we must turn our attention to quite definite accomplishments of the soul. You see, man has a series of such organs in his organization. We call these sense organs the so-called Lotus flowers because the astral image, which man begins to evolve in his aura when he is developing himself in the way described, takes on a form that may be compared with that of a Lotus flower. It goes without saying that this is only a comparison, just as one can speak of the wings of the lung, which also bear only a resemblance to wings. The two-petalled Lotus flower is found in the middle of the head above the root of the nose, between the eyes. Near the larynx is the sixteen-petalled Lotus flower, while in the region of the heart there is the twelve-petalled one, and in the region of the pit of the stomach the one with ten petals. Still farther down are found the six-petalled and four-petalled Lotus flowers. To\u00a0day I want to talk only about the Lotus flowers that have sixteen petals and twelve petals.\n\nIn Buddha's teachings you are given an account of the so-called eightfold path. Now ask yourselves once why Buddha offered precisely this eightfold path as particularly important in the attainment of the higher stages of man's development. This eightfold path is: right resolve, right thinking, right speech, right action, right living, right striving, right memory, right self-immersion, or meditation. A great Initiate such as Buddha does not speak out of a vaguely felt ideal, but out of knowledge of human nature. He knows what influence the practice of such exercises of the soul will have on the future development of the body. If we look at the sixteen-petalled Lotus flower in the average man of today we actually see very little. If I can so express it, it is in the process of flaring up again. In the far-distant past this Lotus flower was once present; it has gone backward in its development. Today it is appearing again, partly through man's cultural activity. In the future, however, this sixteen-petalled Lotus flower will come again to full development. It will glisten vividly with its sixteen spokes or petals, each petal appearing in a different shade of color; and finally, it will move from left to right. What everyone in the future will possess and experience is today being cultivated by those who seek in a conscious way their development in the school of initiation, in order to become leaders of mankind. Now eight of these sixteen petals have already been formed in the far-distant past; today eight have still to be developed, if the mystery pupil wishes to have the use of these sense-organs. These will be developed if man treads the eightfold path in a conscious way, observantly and clearly, if he consciously practices these eight soul activities given by Buddha, and if he arranges his whole life of soul so that he takes himself in hand, practicing these eight virtues as vigorously as he can only do when sustained by his meditation work, thus bringing the sixteen-petalled Lotus flower not only into bloom but also into movement, into actual perception.\n\nI will now speak of the twelve-petalled Lotus flower in the region of the heart. Six petals of this flower were already developed in the far-distant past, and six must be developed by all men in the future, by present-day Initiates and their pupils. In all anthroposophical handbooks you can find reference to certain virtues in the forefront of those that should be acquired by anyone aspiring to the stage of Chela, or pupil. These six virtues which you find mentioned in every anthroposophical handbook concerned with man's development are: control of thought, control of action, tolerance, steadfastness, impartiality, and equilibrium, or what Angelus Silesius calls composure. These six virtues, which one must practice consciously and attentively in conjunction with meditation, bring to unfolding the six further petals of the twelve-petalled Lotus flower. And these are not gathered blindly in the anthroposophical textbooks, nor are they stamped by haphazard or individual inner feeling, but they are spoken out of the great Initiates' deepest knowledge. Initiates know that whoever really wishes to evolve to the higher super-sensible stages of development must bring about the unfolding of the twelve-petalled Lotus flower. And to this end he must today develop, through these six virtues, the six petals that were undeveloped in the past. Thus you see how the great Initiates essentially gave their directions for life out of their own deeper knowledge of the human being. I could extend these remarks to still other organs of knowledge and observation, but I only wish to give you a brief sketch of the process of initiation, and for that these indications should suffice.\n\nWhen the pupil has progressed so far that he begins to form the astral sense-organs, when he has progressed so far that he is capable of perceiving not only the physical impressions in his surroundings but also what belongs to the soul \u2014 in other words, to see what is in the aura of man himself as well as what is in the aura of animals and plants \u2014 he then begins a completely new stage of instruction. No one can see in his environment that which has to do with his soul before his Lotus flowers revolve, just as one without eyes can see no color and no light. But when the barrier is pierced, when the pupil has gone beyond the preliminary stages of knowledge so that he has insight into the soul-world, then true \u201cpupil-ship\u201d first begins for him. This leads through four stages of knowledge. Now what happens in this moment, when man has passed beyond the first steps and has become a Chela? We have seen how all that we have just described related to the astral body. This is organized throughout by the human body. Whoever has undergone such a development has a totally different aura. When man out of his self-consciousness has illuminated his astral body, when he himself has become the luminous organization of his astral body, then we say that this pupil has illuminated his astral body with Manas. Manas is nothing other than an astral body dominated by self-consciousness. Manas and astral body are one and the same, but at different stages of development.\n\nOne must understand this if, in the practice of mysticism, one wishes to apply in a practical way what is given in anthroposophical handbooks as the seven principles. Everyone acquainted with the mystic path of development, everyone who knows something about initiation, will say that these have a theoretical value for study but for the practicing mystic they have value only if the relation existing between the lower and the higher principles is known. No practicing mystic recognizes more than four members: the physical body, in which work chemical and physical laws, the etheric body, the astral body, and finally the self- or Ego-consciousness, called at the present stage of development Kama-Manas, the self-conscious thinking principle. Manas is nothing other than that which has been worked into the body by the self-consciousness. The etheric body in its present form is deprived of any influence of the self-consciousness. We can indirectly influence our growth and nourishment, but not in the same way as we cause our wishes, our thoughts and ideas to proceed from self-consciousness. We cannot ourselves influence our nourishment, digestion, and growth. In men, these are without connection to the self-consciousness. The etheric body has to be brought under the influence of the astral body, the so-called aura. The self-consciousness of the astral body has to penetrate the etheric body \u2014 to be able to work out of itself upon the etheric body \u2014 as man, in the way already shown, works upon his astral body, his aura. Then, when man through meditation, through inner immersion, and through practicing activities of the soul, which I have described, has come so far that the astral body has organized itself, then the work extends to the etheric body, and the etheric body receives the inner word. Then man not only hears what lives in the world around him, but there resounds in him his etheric body, the inner meaning of things.\n\nI have often said here before that the essentially spiritual in things is a resounding. I have drawn your attention to how the practicing mystic, when speaking in a correct sense, talks of a sound in the spiritual world in the same way as of a light in the astral world, or world of desire. Not for nothing does Goethe say, when guiding his Faust to heaven: \u201cDie Sonne t\u00f6nt nach alten Weise im Bruderspharen Wettgesang ...\u201d (\u201cThe sun resounds in ancient fashion, contending with his brother spheres\u201d). Nor are the words of Ariel empty when Faust is being escorted by the spirits into the spiritual world: \u201cT\u00f6nend wird f\u00fcr Geistesohren schon der neue Tag geboren\u201d (\u201cHear the new day being born, Spirit ears can hear its ringing\u201d).\n\nThis inner sounding which, of course, is not at all a sound perceptible to the outer physical ear, this inner word through which things can express their own nature, is an experience that man has when he becomes able to influence his etheric body from his astral body. Then he has become a Chela, a real student of the great Initiates. Then he can be led further upon this path. A man who has thus ascended this step is called a homeless man, because fundamentally he has found the connection with a new world, because it rings to him out of the spiritual world, and because he thereby no longer has his home, so to speak, in this physical world. One must not misunderstand this. The Chela who has reached this stage is just as good a citizen and family man, just as good a friend, as he was before he had reached the stage of Chela. He need not be torn away from anything. What he has experienced is an evolution of the soul, thus acquiring a new home in a world lying behind this physical one.\n\nWhat then has happened? The spiritual world sounds within man, and through this sounding of the spiritual world man overcomes an illusion, the illusion which takes in all men before they begin this stage of development. This is the illusion of the personal self. Man believes himself to be a personality separate from the rest of the world. Mere reflection could teach him that even physically he himself is not an independent being. Bear in mind that if the temperature in this room were 200 degrees higher than it now is, none of us would be able to survive as we now survive. As soon as the outer situation changes, the conditions for our physical existence are no longer there. We are simply a continuation of the external world, and are as separate beings absolutely inconceivable. This is still more the case in the world of the soul and of the spirit. Thus we see that man conceived of as a self is only an illusion \u2014 that he is a member of the universal divine spirituality. Here man overcomes the personal self. Here arises what in the mystic chorus of *Faust* Goethe has expressed in the words: \u201cAlles Verg\u00e4ngliche ist nur ein Gleichnis.\u201d (\u201cAll that is transitory is but a likeness.\u201d) What we see is only a picture of an eternal being. We ourselves are only a picture of an eternal being. When we have surrendered our separate being \u2014 for we live a separate life through our etheric body \u2014 then we have overcome our outer, separate life, we have become part of universal life.\n\nThere arises in man something which we have called Buddhi. Buddhi is now practically reached as a stage in the development of the etheric body, that etheric body which no longer occasions a separate existence but enters into universal life. The man who has attained this has arrived at the second state of Chela-ship. Then all doubts and reservations fall away from his soul; he can no longer be superstitious any more than he can be a doubter. Then he has no more need to secure the truth in order to compare his ideas with the outer environment; then he lives in tone, in the word of things; then what it is sounds and resounds out of its being. And there is no more superstition, no more doubt. This is called the surrendering of the keys of knowledge to the Chela. When he has reached this stage, within it there sounds a word from the spiritual world. Then his own words no longer proclaim an echo of what is in this world, but his words are an echo of what stems from another world, which works into this world, but which cannot be perceived with our outer senses. These words are messengers of the Godhead.\n\nWhen this stage is passed beyond, a new one comes. This is entered by man gaining influence over what is done directly by his physical body. Before this, his influence only extended to his etheric body, but now it extends to his physical body. His actions must set the physical body in motion. What man does is incorporated into what we call his karma. Man, however, does not work on this consciously; he does not know how each of his deeds causes a consequence. It is only now that he begins in a conscious way so to fulfill his actions in the physical world that he consciously works on his karma. Thus, through his physical actions, he wins influence over his karma. And now there is not only a sounding from the objects in his environment, but he has come far enough to be able to utter the name of all things. Man lives in our present stage of culture in such a way that he is only able to utter one single name. That is the name he gives himself: \u201cI.\u201d That is the only name man can really give to himself. (Whoever immerses himself in deeper knowledge can arrive at depths of which psychology does not dream.) It is the only instance in which you yourself can give the name in question. No one else can say \u201cI\u201d to you, only you yourself. To everyone else you must say \u201cyou,\u201d and they in return must say the same. There is something in everyone to which only they themselves can apply the name \u201cI.\u201d On this account the Jewish mystery teachings speak also of an inexpressible name of God. That is something which is immediately a proclamation of God in man. It was forbidden to utter this name unworthily, sacrilegiously; hence the sacred awe, the significance and reality when the Jewish mystery teachers uttered this name. \u201cI\u201d is the one word that says something to you that can never approach you from the outer world. So now, as the average man alone names his \u201cI,\u201d so the Chela in the third stage gives to all things in the world names which he has received out of intuition. That means he has passed into the world \u201cI.\u201d He speaks out of the world \u201cI\u201d itself. He may call everything by its most profound name, whereas the man today standing at the average stage can only say \u201cI\u201d to himself. When the Chela has arrived at this stage, he is called a Swan. The Chela who has been able to raise himself to the point of naming all things is called Swan because he is the messenger of all things.\n\nWhat lies beyond these three stages cannot be expressed in ordinary language. It demands knowledge of a special script only taught in mystery schools. The next stage is the stage of what is veiled. And beyond this lie the stages which belong to the great Initiates, those Initiates who at all times have given the great impulses to our culture. They were Chelas to begin with. To begin with they acquired the keys of knowledge. Next they were led further to the regions where were disclosed to them the universal and the names of things. Then they raised themselves to the stage of the universal, where they could have the deep experiences through which they were qualified to found the great religions of the world.\n\nBut it was not only the great religions that came forth from the great Initiates; it was every mighty impulse, all that is important in the world. Let us take just two examples that show the kind of influence that has been exercised on the world by the great Initiates who have gone through the schooling. Let us go back to everyday life at the time when the pupils of the initiation schools were guided under the leadership of Hermes. This guidance was in the end an ordinary, so-called esoteric, scientific instruction. I can sketch for you in only a few strokes what such instruction contained. It was shown how the Cosmic Spirit descended into the physical world, incarnated himself here, and how he began afresh a material existence, how he then reached the highest stage of man and celebrated his resurrection. Paracelsus in particular has expressed this very beautifully in the following words: \u201cThe individual beings we meet in the outer world are the single letters, and the word that is formed from them is MAN.\u201d Outwardly we have all contributed human virtues or failings to this creation. Man, however, is the fusion of all this. It was taught as esoteric instruction in the Egyptian mystery schools, in all detail and with great richness of spirit, how there lives in man, as microcosm, the fusion of the rest of the macrocosm.\n\nAfter this instruction came the Hermetic instruction. What I have said one can grasp with the senses and the understanding. But what is offered in the Hermetic instruction can only be grasped if one has attained the first stage of Chela-ship. Then one can learn that special script which is neither arbitrary nor a matter of chance, but which gives us the great laws of the spiritual world. This script is not, like ours, an external picture arbitrarily fixed in single letters and parts; it is born out of the spiritual law of nature itself, because the man who becomes versed in this script is in possession of this natural law. All his conception of soul and astral space itself thus becomes regulated by law. What he conceives is conceived in the sense of the great signs of this script. He is capable of this when he has renounced his self. He unites himself with primal everlasting law. Now he has his Hermetic instruction behind him. Henceforward he himself can be admitted to the first stage of a still deeper initiation. Now, as the next stage, he should experience something in the astral world, the essential soul world, that has a significance reaching beyond the cosmic cycles. After he has acquired the capacity for the astral senses to be fully effective, so that they work right down into the etheric body, then for three days he is ushered into a deep mystery of the astral world. In that astral world he then experiences what last time I described to you as the primal origin of the Earth and man. He has before him and he experiences this descent of the spirit, this separation of Sun, Moon, and Earth, and the coming forth of man \u2014 this whole series of phenomena. And at the same time they form themselves into a picture before him. And then he emerges. After he has this great experience in the mystery school behind him, he goes among the people and relates what he has experienced in the soul and astral world. And what he relates runs approximately like this:\n\n\u201cThere was once a divine couple who were united with the earth, Osiris and Isis. This divine pair were regents of everything that happens on earth. But Osiris was pursued by Typhon and cut into pieces, and Isis had to search for the corpse. She did not bring it home, but graves of Osiris were distributed among the various parts of the earth. So he was brought completely down into the earth and buried there. But a ray from the spiritual world fell upon Isis, fertilizing her through immaculate conception with the new Horns.\u201d\n\nThis picture is nothing other than a mighty representation of what we have come to know as the exit of Sun and Moon, as the separation of Sun and Moon and as the dawning of mankind. Isis is the image of the Moon; Horns stands for earthly mankind, the earth itself. Before man was endowed with warm blood, before he was clothed with his physical body, he felt in mighty pictures what proceeded in the soul world. In the beginning of the Lemurian, of the Atlantean and the Arian evolutions, man was always prepared by the great Initiates to receive the mighty truths contained in such pictures. For this reason, the truths were not simply represented but were given in the pictures of Osiris and Isis. All the great religions we meet in antiquity are from what the great Initiates experienced in astral space. And the great Initiates emerged from these experiences and spoke to each particular people in the way they could understand, that is to say in pictures of what the Initiates themselves had experienced in the mystery schools. This was so in ancient times. Only through being in such a school of initiation could one rise to higher astral experience.\n\nAll this was changed with the coming of Christianity. It cut into evolution with great significance. And since the appearance of Christ it has been possible for man to be initiated as an initiate of nature, just as one speaks of a poet of nature. There have been Christian mystics who by grace have received initiation. The first who was called to carry Christianity into all the world under the influence of the words: \u201cBlessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed,\u201d was Paul. The appearance on the road to Damascus was an initiation outside the mysteries. I cannot go into further detail here.\n\nIt was the great Initiates who gave the impulse to all great movements and founding's of culture. From medieval times there comes a beautiful myth that may be said to show us this in a time when one did not yet demand materialistic foundations. The myth arose in Bavaria and has, therefore, assumed the garb of Catholicism. What then happened we will make clear as follows. There arose at that time in Europe the so-called civic culture \u2014 modern citizenship. The onward development of man, the progress of each soul to a higher stage, was understood by the mystic as the advancing of the soul, of the womanly element in man. The mystic sees in the soul something womanly that was fertilized by the lower sense impressions of nature and by the eternal truths. In every historical process the mystic sees such a process of fertilization. For those who see more deeply into man's path of development, for those who see the spiritual forces behind physical appearances, the great and deep impulses for the progress of mankind are given by the great Initiates. Thus the man with a medieval world outlook ascribed to the great Initiates the raising up of the soul to higher stages during the new period of culture that was brought about by means of cities. This city-development was attained by souls making a sudden move forward in history. And it was an Initiate who brought about this move. All mighty impulses were ascribed to the great lodge of Initiates surrounding the Holy Grail. From there came the great Initiates who are not visible to ordinary men. And the Initiate who at that time provided the civic culture with its impulse was called, in the Middle Ages, Lohengrin. It is he who was the missionary of the Holy Grail, of the great lodge; and Elsa of Brabant stands for the soul of the city, the womanly element that was to be fructified through the great Initiate. The mediator is the swan. Lohengrin was brought by the swan into this physical world. The Initiate must not be asked his name. He belongs to a higher world. The Chela, the Swan, has been the mediator of this influence.\n\nI have merely been able to indicate how this great event has again been symbolized for the people in a myth. It is in this way that the great Initiates have worked and have put into their teachings what they have to make known. And in this way worked all those who have founded man's early culture \u2014 Hermes in Egypt, Krishna in India, Zarathustra in Persia, Moses among the Jewish people. Orpheus continued the work \u2014 then Pythagoras, and finally the Initiate of all Initiates, Jesus, who bore within Him the Christ.\n\nHere only the greatest of Initiates are mentioned. We have tried in these descriptions to characterize their connection with the world. What has been described here will still remain remote to many people's thoughts. But those who have become aware of something of the higher worlds in their own souls have always raised their eyes not only to the spiritual world but also to the leaders of mankind. It was only from this standpoint that they have been able to speak in as inspired a way as Goethe. But you find among others, too, something of the divine spark leading towards the point to which spiritual science should again bring us. You find it in the case of a German, a young, intelligent German poet and thinker, whose life has all the appearance of a blessed memory of some former existence as a great Initiate. Those who read Novalis will notice something of the breath that guides us into the higher world. There is something in him that also contains the magic word, though not expressed as explicitly as usual. Thus he has written the beautiful words about the relation of our planet to mankind that convey as much to the lowly and undeveloped as they do to the Initiate:\n\n\u201cMankind is the sense of our earth-planet, mankind is the nerve that binds the earth-planet with the higher worlds; mankind is the eye through which this earth-planet lifts its gaze to the heavenly Kingdoms of the Cosmos.\u201d", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 51188, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Esoteric Development: Lecture VII: The Great Initiates", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565908415, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cqh2kk/esoteric_development_lecture_vii_the_great/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "venusa69", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4aq136sq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565821852, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cqh198/ego_and_spirituality/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cqh198", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "557cec32-611e-11e8-8efe-0e9299b750e8", "link_flair_text": "Enlightenment", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cqh198/ego_and_spirituality/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565821854, "score": 4, "selftext": "In almost any mystical text you can find a saint, a prophet(ess), of even philosophers emphasizing the need to let go of a \"type\" of mind. A mind that is sustained by all the force of our primal history and leaps in civilized life. This is the ego. Neither purely engineered by society, nor strictly propelled by instinct it is often a subject and experience that leaves some of us enchanted, bewildered, and sometimes disillusioned. For a long time people have found it  efficient to refer to the ego as something to be sacraficed, killed, dissolved or transcended.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFortunately, thanks the growing body of knowledge regarding neuroscience and neurobiology we can now afford to speak of the ego in a more inclusive manner. Your Ego isn't a detachable head. It's a species of your biology. It can be argued that if you force a species to constantly relocate and readapt beyond what is necessary then that said species may become unrecognizable, desperately aggressive or in the worse case scenario pushed into extinction.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen we are born our mind has its ground. With the right help and guidance the mind can manifest the better the potentialaties of one's nature. However, as things often are, consciousness undergoes a series of localizations throughout our life. The child relocalizes its consciousness in the awareness, reactions, and expectations of its adult caretakers. The teen in the awareness of its peers. The adult in the awareness, expectations and reactions of its community and society as a whole.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis occurs for better or worse and it often occurs for worse because between any of these transitions people seldomly stop to tell the being of interest that the true value and benefit of any external relationship or model depends on how at home they are within their own being.\u00a0\n\nOn the contrary we march through the many stages of life to the nerve wrecking chant of \"abandon!\" until there is nothing to leave behind or an actual person to do the leaving.\n\n\n\nAh, the uncertainty that grips us with a serpentine force; the doubt that settles under our skin like a second set of bones! That's not a life, but a death to mourn. Well, I dare to seek a different result and mood, and toward that end I propose a new chant. \"This is my Self too!\" I believe it is in our best interest to strive for wholeness. To be so wealthy with Selfhood that we can forego the self-centeredness that comes with \"second natures\" and as result be free to pour that integrity into the world without a minute of splintered thought.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 51188, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Ego and Spirituality", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565908239, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cqh198/ego_and_spirituality/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "benmccurry12", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3yoiqy6v", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565821333, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cqgx7x/its_the_only_thing_that_makes_sense_to_me_right/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cqgx7x", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cqgx7x/its_the_only_thing_that_makes_sense_to_me_right/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565821335, "score": 3, "selftext": "We are but a snake, connected through time.\nOur future is ourself.\n\nMaybe not only a snake, but perhaps a web connected through multi-dimensional space-time?\n\nAll woven together, possibly?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 51188, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "It\u2019s the only thing that makes sense to me right now", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565907713, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cqgx7x/its_the_only_thing_that_makes_sense_to_me_right/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Eagle1111222", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4c3cm0wz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565820339, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cqgp9c/anyone_know_of_any_sweat_lodges_in_connecticut_or/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cqgp9c", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cqgp9c/anyone_know_of_any_sweat_lodges_in_connecticut_or/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565820341, "score": 1, "selftext": "Looking to do a sweat lodge and heard about its healing benefits.

We all search for love. It makes us feel worthy and connected. As most people I'm sure would agree. But have I been searching for nothing? Or I have I been searching for everything? I've found love. I've lost love. And both finding and losing it hurts. Sometimes we are to blame for losing it. Sometimes losing it was completely out of our control. It seems love can leave just as easily as it enters. And always, once it leaves, will remain and linger as it is so strong that it has imprinted upon you. Makes one wonder why something so volatile is also something that the majority seeks and craves. Are we not safer keeping love on the other side of the door? Do we like pain? Or is love such an amazing feeling that the pain is justified? Or is love something that is bigger than an individual? Or 2 individuals? Or all individuals? Love can be destroyed by forces beyond ourselves. And it can be destroyed from within our own souls. We can build walls to keep it out. But should we deprive ourselves? What happens if we build walls so high that we can no longer love ourselves? We crave love. And perhaps, even though it isn't always clear. Loving ourselves is what we truly crave. After all, how do you share and spread the love of your heart to others if there is no love to begin with? You can not draw upon something that is not there. Should we all love ourselves? Yes. Do we all love ourselves? No. Infact, loving yourself can be an extraordinarily difficult path. Some would say this universe is made of a vast collection of love. Love of the collective consciousness. And I would not disagree. However, even in this apparently endless reality of time and space within a universe that we can not ever hope to reach the end of. Full of particles and this collective love and energy that makes up all matter. How can one still feel so alone? For most, it's hard to believe that we are all in this as one. And even as a believer, doubt may still trickle down over your being from time to time. The sad truth is we will never know until we move on to bigger and better places that are most likely beyond any of our comprehension. You can chose your religion. But you will not know if you chose correctly until you move on. You can chose your spiritual path. But you will not know if the journey you took lead you on the correct path of enlightenment or if you simply wandered your mind endlessly, for nothing. You can induce visions with a wide range of \"healing\" drugs. But you will not know if you indeed saw the otherside. Or simply had an intricate chemical reaction in the brain that created something beautiful. Our beliefs drive us. And that is what's important. You can never prove your belief 100%. You can only convince yourself that it is indeed true. And trying to convince another can often be an exercise in futility. All that can be done is accept one another for there opinions. Which quite commonly will be incredibly different from your own. If one was to dissolve their ego. What can possibly remain besides love?.. Hate? No, hate is comprised of feelings that we hold on to when one feels they have been wronged, but with no ego, there is no need to hold on. Envy? No, envy is feeling as one is better than the other. But with no ego, there is no you and there is no them. All we can do is accept. Accept the individual, accept this world and accept this universe. All we can do is show our appreciation with love. After all, that is what we are. We are love, love is belief, belief drives us.

It should be done as a matter of duty. Take, for example, the performance of rituals in temples or in churches. Generally they are performed with the purpose of material benefit, but that is not in the mode of goodness. One should go to a temple or church as a matter of duty, offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and offer flowers and eatables. Everyone thinks that there is no use in going to the temple just to worship God. But worship for economic benefit is not recommended in the scriptural injunction. One should go simply to offer respect to the Deity. That will place one in the mode of goodness. It is the duty of every civilized man to obey the injunctions of the scriptures and offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\"\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 17.11, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n**Related Pic :**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/cqb9w6/qa\\_verse\\_no1711/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GloriousGita/comments/cqb9w6/qa_verse_no1711/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 51126, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "QA : Verse no.17.11", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565883107, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cqba1v/qa_verse_no1711/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "subtlearray", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_60nv7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565793984, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cqansp/is_our_existence_inevitable/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cqansp", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cqansp/is_our_existence_inevitable/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565793986, "score": 1, "selftext": "For our *Self* to come to be in this moment\u2014considering everything that had to happen, at just the right time and place\u2014seems like a miracle.

I would not say that my problems or general anxiety issues seem to be any different from other people I have met.  However, I am trying to understand what kind of impact \"fear\" is having on my consciousness and sub-consciousness.  Therefore, I am trying to understand fear itself.   \n\nI have looked at the scientific side of this and am starting to learn more about how the frontal lobs (one of the things that separate our brains from animal brains) causes us to problem solve, plan, strategize, manage memory, judgment among so many other things.  As the chemicals? in our our brains mix we produce all sorts of emotional responses to things.  Contributing and Exacerbating this are then things like social conditioning, upbringing, the influence of media and people in our lives, etc..  I am not trying to preach about how there is all of this \"evil\" out there, I am just trying to understand my own \"fear\" so that I can try to focus on the opposite - \"Love\". \n\nNow \"love\" is a concept that is a bit lost on me but I am really trying to get it.  That being said, I will add as a primer that I absolutely love my wife and my son and I know what it means to be in love with them, but in a unique way.  However, when I think about them or the love in the family, I get anxious and worried about us all failing (financially or us not being happy) - I feel this is the fear then talking.  \n\nI want to do a better job of practicing compassion and mindfulness, but I feel as though I may be doing it for selfish reasons - so that I can feel happy?  I guess.  Ultimately, I want to begin looking at life through a lens of love, which I have had really hard to do.

The quality of an enlightened soul is its commitment to dreaming despite the nightmarish trails carved into its sight. \n\nEvery day we are told how the world \"is\" by the media and by each other.

It is that frame which becomes an anti-spiritual chamber and thus an inertiating experience of materiality. \n\nI truly believe the timeless spiritual principal of none-judment is a wonderfully effective way of reclaiming our freedom.

Lets just say I am crazy, that would in a way be the conclusion and the main point of my story. But the good news is, I am not crazy as I was in the past. In the past I was crazy in a negative and dark way. I was lost, blind and ignorant fool. A drunk, violent intoxicated teenager driven by ego and pride. I cared only about my reputation, prestige and gaining power. One day, after years of intense suffering, I just couldn't keep on going that broad way which lead to destruction, both mine and of others. One day I lost my pride and my ego was vanquished, or at least my alter ego has vanished, the personality of who I thought I were, was scattered to infinite pieces. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnly then had I began to question, and seek the important questions to life, what is the meaning of life, what is the point of living, what is the purpose of my being, why am I here, who am I and why do we exist, how it all came to be, what is life?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI began seeking the answers to this questions in the bible, I read an illustrated bible, from beginning to end, but still after finishing it, I was left confused about hell and after life, and I had even more questions than before I started to read it. It didn't had sense to me after reading through old and new testament. in old God seemed to be so angry, punitive, then at other time he was pure love, how is that possible, can God change His mind? does he have feelings and a weakness of human ignorance. How can he who loves us most, condemn us to most terrible suffering.\n\nI really didn't find answers to meaning of life, hell and after life. Tho I can admit I enjoyed most the parables on the mount, because after reading them a magnificent transformation occurred within me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Jesus said:\n\n\"Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because its foundation was on the rock.\n\nBut everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell\u2014and great was its collapse!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that for the first time in my life I forgave those I thought wronged me, and for the first time in my life I had peace when I managed to forgive everyone, including myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, this is where my positive craziness begins. This is crazy me in a light way, I know all this will sound unbelievable, crazy, and that you will perhaps doubt and wont be able to imagine mentally what I will try to explain and convey, but I truly must tell you, that I will speak only the solemn truth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond thing I applied from the teachings of Jesus was;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAsk, and it shall be given to you.\n\nSeek, and you will find.\n\nKnock, and the door will be opened to you.\n\n\\~Matthew 7:7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked for Wisdom, \n\nseeked the truth, \n\nand knocked on the heaven door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd after I read:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeek the Kingdom of Heaven and everything shall be given to you. \\~Luke 12:31\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd this made me realize than my priority in life should be to seek the Kingdom of Heaven, since with it would come all that I could ever ask for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTruly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.\n\n  John 16:23 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here I was, humbled on my knees with my hands joined together in prayer, I addressed God; \"Lord, God, You who are the Father of All Creation, You who are the Creator of everything, Father of Jesus Christ, in name of Jesus I ask you, and I beg you, please, send me your Son Jesus Like you had to your prophets and messengers, Please, Father, Send me your Son Jesus so He may tell me: what is the Truth, what is the meaning of Life, please I ask you for Wisdom, I desire to know what will happen in future, when is the end of the world going to be, what will happen to me in future, and please I must know will I go to hell or heaven, oh please, allow me to be on your side, and by Jesus side in His kingdom,please, I ask for the kingdom of heaven, I ask for salvation, please allow me to serve you, send me Jesus so he can teach me the truth, allow me to be know the truth and be your messenger, even if that means that nobody would believe me, even if it means that my own family wont believe me and think I am crazy, even if I am rejected by all friends, please, even if it means I am the only only one to know the truth, that is a burden I shall gladly bear, that is a cross that of my own free will shall I carry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, we have come to the climax of my introduction, and the most unbelievable, unimaginable and crazy part. Don't seek my explanation on how I remember this, I can only say I remember this because it was the will of God and my own desire to remember this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne night, while my body lay in bed, mind immersed in deep sleep, in the empty, void, dark and silent state of being, I heard a voice. Which spoke; 'I AM' \\*\\*\\*Sananda\\*\\*\\*(I don't feel worthy to pronounce His Higher True Soul Name) (And I would like to add that it a telepathic approach of communication) I heard your prayers brother/child (brother/child sounded telepathically like one word), Through the power of His next word, my soul was lifted out of the body, as he said \"rise\", same instance my soul obeyed and raised upward our outward from this world which faded from my awareness and perception, and here I was, on a higher platform, where everything was light, I cant describe it, because I was in pure soul state, and there were no senses involved. We can say my body was in something like suspended animation while my soul was liberated from the flesh of the body and material world. An Lo, and figure radiated before me, the figure before me shined brighter than all the darkness around me. This Light which He had emanated was warming my entire soul to my very core. This was something absolutely best that my soul ever felt, because the beauty of this radiance, and the warmth of this Light, was the most powerful Love which my soul and being ever felt. As if I came face to face, with power of ten thousand Sun's.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.\n\n(Luke 11:10 - Matthew 7:8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, if I were to write all that had transpired afterwards, I supposed I would need to reincarnate 10.000 times to write it all down,   If I were to write down everything that Jesus, my Merciful and Graceful King revealed to me, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!\n\nMatthew 7:9-11\n\n  \nPS- If you wish to support me, mainly so I can pay my bills for electricity, my paypal email is [johnoflovelight@gmail.com](mailto:johnoflovelight@gmail.com)\n\n  \nthank you,   \n\n\nLove &amp; Light,  \n\n\nyour friend.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 50966, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Testimony &amp; Revelation", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565821993, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cq0lqy/testimony_revelation/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Primrosedoll88", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2vfy2r8x", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565735136, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cq0i4s/dealing_with_other_peoples_energy/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cq0i4s", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "fa02bd38-8418-11e7-839e-0ecd58f017ce", "link_flair_text": "Channeling", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cq0i4s/dealing_with_other_peoples_energy/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565735138, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve found that I\u2019m extremely sensitive to other people\u2019s energy.

and even post.**\n\nI can't really talk about this stuff with my friends because they don't understand many spiritual things and are not interested in that sort of stuff.\n\nSince I was a little kid I always knew I was different from others, I did not think the same way as others. I'm a learner/observer and young as 13-14 I started learning about spirituality just on my own being inside my head for a long time. \n\nI know a lot about the universe and about the laws of it (for example the laws of the universe, a book which I've read already) but the thing is I knew most of those laws when I was younger. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChildhood was bad, mostly only bad memories. Seeing violence, and just being alone and not really anybody (like adult) to talk to. Trauma too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suffer from drug problems and bad depression and anxiety, I've tried ending my life when I was younger but I'm over all that. Of course I still struggle, but its part of me and has made me stronger and I see it as a positive thing now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm successful for my age. I have tens of thousands of dollars in savings. Money does not bring happiness everyone knows that, but my childhood was all about money. Money that, money that. Never affording any clothes, getting bullied because of broken clothes. Not affording to go to the movies with friends because my single disabled mom didn't have money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel unsatisfied with life. I however have a dream and its related in music and I've had that dream for like 4 years now but never really acted on it until last year. I feel like its the only thing that will make me happy longterm, like im destined for it.\n\nI don't wanna live my life like regular people, don't wanna work for no fucking body and I don't wanna own my own business. That's boring and doesn't fullfill me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I'm worried going after my dreams. Its mostly the fear many people have when trying to achieve their dreams, they stop because of fear, or judgement from others. But I think I need to say fuck it and go for it, but its hard.\n\nDeep down in my heart I somehow know that it's going to all work out, I've planned this for years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanna prove everyone wrong. Even family, friends and other people who have doubted me. Well they don't know about my business success or financial things, but still. I wanna prove a point that I'm more than I am.\n\nMusic is the thing I love the most, and my only dream is to do it. I feel like I have a talent for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't wanna make this too long, but there has been so many signs from the universe regarding my dream.\n\nMost recent example is, I was visiting my old college and they did some interview about me regarding my next school and he asked me what I do on my free time. I told I'm on the computer sometimes and he said \"you do music?\"\n\nNobody in my life knows I do music, I don't even look like a guy that is a music guy if that's a thing. There is so many things like that has happened that somehow confirm that I should go for my dream. Like its surreal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDecided to share, if you want to read it then thank you. Wondering if any of you feel the same. I just sometimes feel that life is not worth living if I don't live the life I want.

"selftext": "So, recently last week, my wife and I went to an Earthbound Trading Co., and were perusing around the store, and generally having... well\u2014an AMAZING time! My wife picks out this set of Tarot Cards and says, \u201cI want to get these SOOO bad, but I\u2019m soo attached to MY deck!\u201d (She has an original Rider Set, and has this *unbreakable* bond with them.) I looked at them, and... omg\u2014an *immediate* bond was generated! It was practically love-at-first-sight!\n\nThis [Mystic Mondays](https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/9/5/383b5ad5-3fae-4d3f-8be8-98ba8703f64b-leo.jpg) Set just absolutely, without-a-doubt, all-Universe-knowing, had just walked into my life! She may had been able to pass-up an amazing deck like this, but I sure as HECKISH, was not about to!  Haha!\n\nSo, after agreeing that we would *eventually* purchase her a set of her own, we went to the checkout counter. While checking out, we mentioned doing my first-ever tarot reading with them to get a feel for them. (My wife reads tarot for a living, so she basically knew all the ropes. I\u2019m simply a guy trying to start a life-coaching business\u2014so I know little to *nothing* by this point about cards, etc.)\n\nWe get home, over an hour away, and we whip out these little girls, and I immediately start shuffling them! Contrary to my already-existing knowledge, these cards were quite large in-hand (which I couldn\u2019t had placed so well without relation to another deck at the time of purchasing. However, once we arrived at home, the shuffling had made it 1000% clear that we weren\u2019t in Texas anymore! Haha\u2014punns.) I did my first tarot reading for her, and then I proceeded to do a self-reading. Very intrinsic, and introspeculative!\n\nWe had a trip to Houston to take for work, and well, we had to pack that night and eventually leave the next morning (as it was nearly 7-hours away). We left and boy did I regret not bringing my deck with me! I felt like I was missing my best friend while we were hours away from them!\n\nSo we drove through Austin, and stopped at this little food-truck called \u201cRevolution Vegan Kitchen\u201d (which definitely had us fooled as we were thinking it was a restaurant? Anyways... We ate there, and walked back to the truck. As I\u2019m making my way back to the truck, I notice somethign white and short on the sidewalk almost inches in front of the truck. I think to myself, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t there earlier?\u201d as I pick up the strange object. After quick examination, it seemed that I was holding in my very hands a selenite tealight candle holder! And definitely nothing less than $20 from a metaphysical shop (if not more!) In awe, I take pictures, sending them to my wife as she was busy ordering us some food for the road. She comes in (after not having been able to check her phone) and nearly heart-attacks because 1) selenite is literally one of her favorite crystals, and 2) it\u2019s a tealight holder (which she manufactures tealights by hand)\u2014so this was weird! Reward number 1 from the Universe after my tarot cards introduction.\n\nAnywho, the real exciting part happened at Loving Hut in Houston... This was literally **the most** crazy/immediate experience/manifestation I\u2019d ever had in my *entire life!* One of the cashier ladies had asked a manager/cook about my ordering a plate of just veggies from this one plate (because they literally were SO AMAZING!) So, once she returned, she said that the manager said that because it was such a large plate of veggies, that it should be priced as a regular plate. By this point\u2014in my mind, I was like \u201cWTF?\u201d but kept on with a straight smile and paid it thinking it forward.\n\nThe other girl who I had been talking to also brought out the plate of veggies and said \u201cthat\u2019s a lot of veggies!\u201d And I interjected, \u201cyeah! too bad it costed me nearly ten dollars for it!\u201d She looked stunned by this point. \u201cNo way! They charged you $10 for just a plate of veggies? Please tell me you hadn\u2019t already paid!\u201d I looked a bit embarrassed, and said, \u201cYeah\u2014actually, I did already...\u201d She left promptly not saying anything.\n\nA couple of moments went by, and I told my wife across from me that I had actually said that in hopes that she was to try to reimburse me $5 or something like that, because really... $10 was quite extensive for some stir-fried vegetables. \n\nShe looked like she had just seen a ghost... And it got stranger. The short-haired brunette came back to the table, and said, \u201cHey I\u2019m really sorry that they charged you $10 for that plate. Here, please take this $5.\u201d Neither of us knew what to say! Neither of us knew how to even act remotely human at that point\u2014it was just nod and smile!\n\nAs the girl walked away, my wife leaned in and told me, \u201cLiterally AS you were saying that I saw her walking up to us, with money-in-hand! I couldn\u2019t believe that she gave you that EXACT amount! The second reward from the Universe after receiving my tarot cards!\n\nQuite incidentally, we got back to the hotel later that night and try our room key. To no avail, the key will *not* work for us regardless of what we did. So I went up to the front desk. I told the kind front desk sir that we were having some trouble with the key on our room\u2019s door. He began looking into the account. \u201cUmm, I show here that you only booked one night\u2019s stay?\u201d I said, \u201cthat\u2019s strange, because I actually have the travel reservation here in my email.\u201d I whip out my phone, and show him the **two** nights\u2019 stay, as well as the reference number. He says, \u201cit\u2019s even showing a different reservation number here! Let me enter that one in!\u201d\n\nEventually he says, \u201cyou\u2019re good! Here\u2019s your key!\u201d He hands me the key, I try it on the room, and voila! we\u2019re back in. None of our stuff was tampered with. None of our room was cleared\u2014which was what we *intended* to happen.\n\nThe part that was interesting was that we were charged for 1-night\u2019s security deposit ($25) instead of the two-night\u2019s security deposit ($50). I feel like that was gift number 3 from the Universe!\n\nTL;DR\n\nAfter buying my first deck of tarot cards, I started to experience strange phenomena while in Houston. It seemed more than odd that I would be able to 1) find a selenite tealight candle-holder 2) receive $5 from having overpaid for a tiny plate order, and 3) receive basically two nights\u2019 stays at thhe price of 1.9 or so!\n\nHow many of you have felt that there was this \u2018silver string\u2019 tying you and the Universe together? Personally, I feel much empowered to utilize the powers given to me instead of shunning them furter away, and saying, \u201cmanifesting takes time...\u201d I don\u2019t think I could be the ONLY person that this happened to?

First thing first is perspective; your point of view. I have come to realize that my attitude towards a given situation that i considered emotionally disturbing was simply based on my perspective. You want positive results? Think positive.\n\n Second step is letting go of who and what doesn't serve you. I had to take a step back and evaluate the people in my life. I decided i no longer wanted to entertain negative energy. I now simply acknowledge that this is MY Journey and to expect everyone to have the same heart and mind as me is just delusional. Knowing who to let go can be a bit complicated when love is in the mix as well as traditional toxic behaviors that has been passed down throughout generations.\n\nLast but not least, is knowing your self worth.

I&amp;#39;ve come a long way and have learned so much along the way. I would like to share a few things that I&amp;#39;ve learned that has helped me tremendously as far as going through a tough time ( what ever it may be) and getting through it. First thing first is perspective; your point of view. I have come to realize that my attitude towards a given situation that i considered emotionally disturbing was simply based on my perspective. You want positive results? Think positive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second step is letting go of who and what doesn&amp;#39;t serve you. I had to take a step back and evaluate the people in my life. I decided i no longer wanted to entertain negative energy. I now simply acknowledge that this is MY Journey and to expect everyone to have the same heart and mind as me is just delusional. Knowing who to let go can be a bit complicated when love is in the mix as well as traditional toxic behaviors that has been passed down throughout generations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, is knowing your self worth.

It should be done as a matter of duty. Take, for example, the performance of rituals in temples or in churches. Generally they are performed with the purpose of material benefit, but that is not in the mode of goodness. One should go to a temple or church as a matter of duty, offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and offer flowers and eatables. Everyone thinks that there is no use in going to the temple just to worship God. But worship for economic benefit is not recommended in the scriptural injunction. One should go simply to offer respect to the Deity. That will place one in the mode of goodness. It is the duty of every civilized man to obey the injunctions of the scriptures and offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.  \n**Question 1 : How the sacrifice in the mode of goodness should be performed ? What example of this is given in this verse ?** \n\n**Related Pic :**  [http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/11](http://www.gloriousgita.com/verse/en/17/11)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 50844, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 17.11", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565765506, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cpp1q2/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1711/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "orsegirl", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2gx3sl44", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565671109, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cpo5r5/tvmovie_recommendations/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cpo5r5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cpo5r5/tvmovie_recommendations/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565671110, "score": 48, "selftext": "\nHey y'all.

I love this community and it's one of the last few things that keeps me sane.\n\nAnyways, September-ish of 2018 (My first semester in college), I had a mental breakdown during one of my homework assignments.\n\nFirst of all, I got frustrated at the homework, but then I thought about everything I was doing up until this point of my life, and I started to question if going to college was the right choice. \n\nMy (random) roommate and I really didn't click, the new friends I made, our schedules never lined up, and I felt alienated by my professors due to me being foolish and close minded about the material at first (It was music theory, I had learned without sheet music, no lessons or training).\n\nI don't know how i let so much get to me and let it bother me, because I was always a pretty cool headed person growing up, with some melancholic depression here and there, but it felt manageable enough to keep to myself.\n\nI was always an independent spirit, or so I thought. Despite the mostly (and intensely isolating) inner turmoil I've been through in the last 11 months, I chose to ignore the breakdown (otherwise I would have completely shut down, I came so close to crashing and burning) and kept trying to improve myself:\n\nI went vegetarian (properly, with supplements and protein)\n\nI became sexually abstinent on all fronts as a form of  energetic detox (no dirty content either)\n\nI spent more time alone, as I slowly drifted into a whirlwind of confusion of my place in this time and space beyond anything I've ever thought possible, and there I went into a pool of cynicism, and I had been the most open minded of people (or so I thought again?) \n\nI've obsessed over all the spiritual stuff in the process in order to gain some clarity. I got readings, bought multiple tarot decks in order to find an accurate reading, bought numerous crystals, and listened to meditation videos almost every night (despite only having meditated only once).\n\nI honestly don't know if this is normal. At this point, I'm slightly out of shape, and have only been waking up, eating, going to work, binging internet, and then going to sleep. I used to be a rather creative spirit, but feel too upset about my current state of being, almost ashamed that I ever let myself get this low. Ironically, I've also never felt more satisfied with the progress I've made.\n\nSomething about me as a whole feels inauthentic, stagnant, and lost.\n\nLogically, I know nothing's wrong with me. For some reason, my body, my spirit, or both are at odds with me, possibly to the point of feeling splintered in inside out. Once I realized how messed up I became, I felt shame out of it, and not wanting to spread the negativity just by being around others. It kills me on the inside to think about being the energy villian, when I, myself am empathic on some ironic esoteric level and have experienced people like the one I've recently become.\n\nI know I overthink, I know I'm not the most grounded.\n\nAny advice of what I could do, I've already looked it up.\n\nWhat more I'm looking for, is a perspective, a connection. I feel so left alone, by the universe. Sure, I could reach out more, but I just dont know right now.\n\nHelp.\ud83d\udd90\ufe0f", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 50813, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "My Perspective: Mental Breakdown", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565764912, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cpnsoz/my_perspective_mental_breakdown/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "basskitty97", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_21pdtfd5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565665454, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cpn52s/are_clean_numbers_1130_5meaning_not_523_a_type_of/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cpn52s", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cpn52s/are_clean_numbers_1130_5meaning_not_523_a_type_of/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565665455, "score": 1, "selftext": "For once I have a question rather than being a lurker.

At first I didn\u2019t think I had any, I had a normal childhood. I wasn\u2019t molested or abused and I had friends and was a happy kid, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t have any pain in my chest, I don\u2019t feel anything, this must mean I\u2019m fine, but I DID just get out of a 12 year narcissistic abusive relationship and recently learned that my mother has borderline personality disorder, so there must be something wrong with me. I\u2019ve been reading all about healing from this type of relationships for the last few weeks.\n\nCut to Sunday evening, I\u2019m doing chores after spending the afternoon taking a scenic drive down the Pacific Coast Highway. I finally set the dishwasher and sit down to read a book about self healing. I get to this section that talks about confronting negative parts of yourself and that we have to be really ready for whatever comes up. I know that my worst part is when I get high on weed and get paranoid so I decide that I will get high and sit with the paranoia, talk to it and see what comes out of it.\n\nSure enough, soon after smoking I start to hear my upstairs neighbor walking around. I immediately go \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have set the dishwasher now! It\u2019s 7pm! It\u2019s really loud!\u201d And I sit with that feeling for a bit, I start to challenge it with \u201cI\u2019ve run it at this time in the past\u201d, \u201cCan my neighbor even hear it?\u201d, \u201cHave I ever heard my neighbor\u2019s dishwasher?\u201d. And then my mind responds with: \"Let\u2019s Google it, see how loud dishwashers are and if it\u2019s ok to run it at 7pm\", and I fall for it.\n\nThere I am wasting time searching for this and I manage to stop myself and realize this was a distraction that\u2019s keeping me from what I wanted to do. So I close my eyes and go back to focusing on my thoughts, except this time I\u2019m met with \u201cDamn idiot\u201d, \u201cWhat are you doing\u201d, \u201cStupid\u201d etc. And suddenly I hear this thought saying \u201cIt\u2019s OK\u201d, over and over again. Just \"it\u2019s OK\", a hundred times (literally). Then the phrase turns into \u201cIt\u2019s OK son\u201d and I freak out a little. Dad? I manage to say out loud, and my mind just keeps repeating \u201cIt\u2019s OK son\u201d I open my eyes and I see a picture of my dad I had set on top of the TV. I start to focus on the photo, the phrase serves as a mantra as my vision turns blurry on the edges and I can see white static in my peripheral vision and I hear the white noise that my dishwasher is making.\n\nThe phrase continues while I start to picture all the times that my parents (both mom and dad) were abusive, neglectful, hurtful, distant, angry, rude, scary and I remember how that felt. I start to go through all the things I think would have disappointed my dad, the phrase persists. My heart is pounding out of my chest I can actually hear it and it feels like it\u2019s going a hundred miles an hour. I start to feel what it was like to be a kid again, without so much bullshit and hiding feelings and presenting a face to the outside. I felt the pure joy it was to play and be kid again, this feels incredible. I also felt the intense pain of shame and rejection, this was not that great.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t last for very long though as I start to feel chills down my spine that make my arms and legs twitch, after a few twitches I\u2019m forced to lose focus on the photo and I snap back into reality. A few seconds pass and I start crying uncontrollably, loudly and for a long time. Crying without any other thought other than the fact I was crying.\n\nAs I calm down I notice the dishwasher again and I go \u201cTurn it off already!\u201d It\u2019s really loud, so I get up and do so. I notice that now I have my arms crossed and I\u2019m hitting one of my arms with my thumb. I see my reflection in my microwave and I hear a voice inside saying \u201cAngry\u2019s back\u201d.\n\nI somehow manage to get myself to write a summary of everything that just happened before I forget it, in case I forget it (I didn\u2019t). And I feel a lot of resistance, my head is spinning and I can hardly believe what just happened.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t know whether I had a paranoid delusion, a psychotic break or this was my protective part playing tricks or denying what happened. I only know that as I type this more congruent version, stone cold sober, the feeling in my heart is less intense but similar. A fairly strong feeling in my heart that I didn\u2019t have before, I only had a void before. I don\u2019t know who or what caused this incredibly intense experience to happen but I can certainly say it was spiritual. That is all.\n\nThanks for reading.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 50784, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I may have had a spiritual experience", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565763990, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cplvgn/i_may_have_had_a_spiritual_experience/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "corieallegory", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2zn1nln2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565658926, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/cplsxr/what_am_i_supposed_to_be_doing_with_my_life_in/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cplsxr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/cplsxr/what_am_i_supposed_to_be_doing_with_my_life_in/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565658927, "score": 4, "selftext": "I can't shake the feeling that just existing is enough. \n\nI've always been skeptical of religions and Gods but I am a spiritual person deep down.
