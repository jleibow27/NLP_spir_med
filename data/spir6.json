It is easy to become lazy and question if any of this is real. I want to share something I experienced yesterday that made me have faith again. Yesterday at my work I found an injured bird, I didn't want to leave it. I got a box with a blanket and moved the bird to a covered position where it wouldn't be bothered. If I am being honest I sat in my car with the bird for 20 minutes sobbing wondering what i could do to help this bird. After I moved it and made sure it was safe I went home, still upset. I felt so hopeless that I couldn't do more, I was troubled so I meditated on it. What I realized is that I was wanting more compassion and sympathy in the world, and with that realization it became clear. \"I\" am the one who can be that kindness, I dont have to wait for someone to come and help, I AM the help. I AM here in this moment, I was the compassion that bird needed and I was there at the right time to help. I was not helpless, I did do something. With this powerful thought it came to me to stop waiting for the world to be kind or compassionate. I can be that, even if no one else ever does a kind thing again, I can still be the kindness that the world needs. By this action others will hopefully be inspired to stop waiting for the world to change and BE the change the world so desperately needs. Kindness costs you nothing.\n\n\\-Hermit", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68164, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Be the change you are waiting for.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dwc0mb/be_the_change_you_are_waiting_for/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "potatodoodles", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_46usb9mk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573746571, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dwbb8g/is_the_universe_my_spirit_guide_sending_me_signs/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dwbb8g", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dwbb8g/is_the_universe_my_spirit_guide_sending_me_signs/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573746585, "score": 1, "selftext": "I've been stuck in a karmic relationship and I broke up two weeks ago and decidedly to have a dating break\nBut I had a guy in my class that os really into me and whenever I'm with him I get these weird signs ?

The Supreme Lord, who is known as the yaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63a\u1e25, or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices, is the master of all demigods who serve Him as the different limbs of the body serve the whole. Demigods like Indra, Candra, Varu\u1e47a, etc., are appointed officers who manage material affairs, and the Vedas direct sacrifices to satisfy these demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water sufficiently to produce food grains. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods. For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, offer food to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and then eat-a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and then taken by us makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, who eats only food offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can counteract all reactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization. On the other hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful action, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins. The material world is full of contaminations, and one who is immunized by accepting pras\u0101dam of the Lord (food offered to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u) is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination.\n\nFood grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats different kinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the refuse of the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who are accustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of vegetation in order to eat the animals. Therefore, ultimately, we have to depend on the production of the field and not on the production of big factories. The field production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such rains are controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all servants of the Lord. The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one who cannot perform them will find himself in scarcity-that is the law of nature. Yaj\u00f1a, specifically the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a prescribed for this age, must therefore be performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply.\n\n**Question 1 : Why one must first offer food to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a before eating ?**\n\n**Question 2 : What is the reason for the scarcity of food ? How it can be counteracted ?**\n\n[Picture : Bhagavad-gita 3.14](https://gloriousgita.com/verse/en/3/14)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68126, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 3.14", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dw6hkr/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_314/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ashleypox2005", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4lhkj2gf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573718865, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dw6f0f/feeling_close_to_the_sky_and_the_stars/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dw6f0f", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dw6f0f/feeling_close_to_the_sky_and_the_stars/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573718866, "score": 1, "selftext": "does anyone else feel one with the sky?

I am concentrating on decluttering at the moment.  \n\nWhen I first moved here it was quiet but then a person with mental illness moved in below and is constantly making noise.

(Also purchased while going through a grieving process).\n\nI have read about smudging with sage and I did that for one of my friends with bad tenants living with him previously.  I salted the room, helped him get new furniture and bedding etc.   None of it worked, and he got more bad tenants.\n\nI do feel space clearing can work but I'd like some advice for my current situation.

Here are some lessons I've learned from the cat.\n\nDisclaimer: There are cats who lie at the extremes of the spectrum, either super agitated or super relaxed, which I don't intend to go into here. Maybe I'll write another post about what leads to these extremes in animals, as well as how we can learn from that. \n\nLesson one: \n\n&gt;If you sit, just sit. If you walk, just walk. Whatever you do, don't wobble.\n\n\\-Zen saying\n\nCats are some of the most self-assured creatures out there. You cannot knock them off balance, you cannot faze them, and whenever they enter a heightened state of arousal you can bet they'll be calmly cleaning themselves a moment later. \n\nHumans, on the other hand, are full of apprehension. When we pet, we are not sure if we stroke or rub. When we hold them, we soon shift positions or move entirely. When stressed, we allow it to muddy our mind for the rest of the day.\n\nThis clash shows itself all the time in our ape-feline interactions. You may see that your cat will stare at you for a long time before coming to greet you. This is because they are waiting for you to be as sure as they are. They know they want to cuddle, but they understand that there are certain conditions to greeting a human - we may keep them at arm's length, focus more on changing channels than grooming them, or any other rude behavior. Cats may even seem \"offended\" in response to some of our behaviors, with ears held flat and eyes narrowed at us. This is because what seems like a small fumble to us is an absolute insult in the social kingdom of cats, where nuance is key.\n\nJust think about two cats grooming each other. Their eyes are peacefully closed, their posture pointed towards one another, and only a very important stimuli could distract them from their task. This is what they ask of us, and this sort of concentration on a task is something humans struggle with. Concentration happens to be the most important and difficult aspect of the spiritual path, so we should be open to learning from our feline friends on this matter. \n\nLesson two: \n\n&gt;Every hour, every minute is changing. If we stop observing change, then we stop seeing everything as new.\n\n\\-Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche\n\nA commonly shared observation of cats is their tendency to go from \"purrr\" to \"grrrr\". This is especially apparent when we are rubbing their soft little bellies, and just as we look away they dig they put the death grip on our unsuspecting hands. We tend to hold this against our cats, calling them bipolar. The reality is that a cat is just much more in tune with its moment-to-moment shifting emotions, and expects us to be equally in tune with this. The cat sees no conflict between happy now and angry now, and they must think it's ridiculous that we have such difficulty grasping such a simple concept. \n\nSo, like the last lesson, we should be focused on our task - and we should also be aware of its changes in every moment. Never expect the next moment to be the same as the last, for this mistakes the nature of our reality. \n\nAlso, as a tip, stop rubbing your cat every minute or so, offer your hands for them to sniff, and I assure you they will offer themselves to be pet again. This will keep them confident that you are in tune with their emotional state.\n\nLesson three:\n\nI don't have a fancy quote for this one, besides to say - in, or out?\n\nIt's the age old dilemma of the cat. Once I am done yowling at the door to get inside, it is now time to yowl at the door to get back out. Where humans see indecision, cats see arbitrary barriers to freedom. Why decide on in or out, when wandering is a perfectly fine answer too? Or perhaps the goal is not to go anywhere, but simply to yowl? \n\nThis may seem like a contradiction to the first lesson, but this mistake just demonstrates how much we have to learn from cats! While humans run from thing to thing because our minds are filled to the brim with fast-moving information which makes it difficult to focus, cats simply flow from thing to thing as intentions change. It is one thing to have shifting intentions, another to have no clear intention at all!\n\nBe present with the shifting moment, and understand yourself as a being of contradiction. Just like the cat do. \n\nThose are all my lessons I've learned from our humble feline brethren. There are similarities between all of these lessons, but the distinctions are important. This present-moment awareness has many facets, and cats give us just a few ways we can work on these separate facets.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 68055, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why our cats bite us, and what they have to teach us", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dw2ibm/why_our_cats_bite_us_and_what_they_have_to_teach/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "xStingx", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_16bzsbgb", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573691391, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dw19h6/1111_phone_call/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dw19h6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dw19h6/1111_phone_call/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573691392, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was doing a tarot card reading and was unaware that I got a phone call.

Now  I'm not sure if you all are aware but there is a house and Gary said to be a portal to hell. A few people recently died in that house. I believe it made news a few years back. However while I try to shy away from race and constructs of race, the person who spray painted the hundreds of portals throughout the house knew exactly what they were doing. This is the strongest form of spiritual warfare I've seen against people who look like me that I was able to witness firsthand.

I know that earth can be trying sometimes but portals to hell ain't helping. I find that in order to deal with this instead of closing ourselves off to it. Deal with them firsthand, face to face,  and stop allowing their power of fear to control our realm.

Whether it is psychological, emotional, physical, or even spiritual, it is unfortunately very likely that we will endure some amount of hardship in one way or another. Having said that, there is a great difference between suffering needlessly, like an eternal victim of the negative circumstances of the world, and becoming a triumphant hero who is able to overcome their struggles, by allowing their discomfort to motivate them to become even stronger and wiser.\n\nIn religious terms, some consider suffering to be a punishment from God for not living in accordance with his will, whilst others believe the Devil to be the true cause of the suffering of humanity. Atheists take a more rational approach and believe it to simply be an unfortunate element of existence itself. Regardless of whether these beliefs are true or not, suffering is here to stay for the time being, and so we should become more prepared to deal with it by developing resilience, and learning skills to cope more effectively.\n\nCauses of suffering range from the mistreatment from others, physical ailments, mental health disorders, trauma, tragedy, spiritual crises, general fears, extreme guilt, shame and self-hate.\n\nPeople respond to suffering in a variety of ways, some of which have led to some of the worst crimes in history, and others have allowed people to transcend their suffering and become greater versions of themselves. Other methods include denial, distractions, medication, and various other ways of trying to numb the pain. The following three tips will hopefully give a more mature and healthy way of effectively reducing suffering experienced in our lives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tip 1: Self-compassion**\n\nWhen you suffer, you should practice having compassion for yourself, which should help mitigate much of the pain that comes with it. If you are being hard on yourself, or you believe that you don\u2019t deserve compassion and forgiveness, then a good tip is to imagine you are caring for a close friend, family member, or other loved one.\n\nInstead of saying:\n\n**1)** \u201cI\u2019m a helpless victim\u201d\n\n**2)** \u201cI deserves this\u201d\n\n**3)** \u201cWhy did this happen to me\u201d\n\n**4)** \u201cI\u2019m worthless\u201d\n\nSay:\n\n**1)** \u201cI choose to be a survivor\u201d\n\n**2)** \u201cNo one deserves to suffer\u201d\n\n**3)** \u201cNothing is personal\u201d\n\n**4)** \u201cI am worthy, even though I am imperfect and make mistakes\u201d\n\nThis method is particularly useful is you are \u2018beating yourself up\u2019 for mistakes and sins that you have made in the past. You should be aware of immoral things that you have done, and aim to change them, but endlessly tormenting yourself isn\u2019t helpful and will only make things worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tip 2: Meaning**\n\nIt was theorised by the psychiatrist Viktor Frankl, who lived through the Holocaust, that one of the best solutions to suffering in life is by searching for meaning in it. He developed Logotherapy, which is a therapy based on existential analysis, and focusses on Kierkegaard\u2019s *will* *to* *meaning*. One of the key principles is that striving to find meaning in our lives, is the most powerful, motivating and driving force in humans.\n\nThe three basic principles of logotherapy are as follows:\n\n1. Life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones.\n2. Our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life.\n3. We have freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stance we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering.\n\nSo whatever problems we are facing in our lives, whether we are being haunted by memories of the past, or anticipating fears of the future, we should try to discover and derive some meaning out of it if possible. Sometimes the answer we are looking for may be obvious, whereas other times the meaning or purpose may seem elusive, so we will have to try harder to find it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tip 3: Defence mechanisms**\n\nTwo people may experience the same problem, the same frustration, the same pain and suffering, yet decide to deal with it in two completely different ways. The brain uses defence mechanisms to deal with unacceptable, or potentially harmful, stimuli and impulses. Many of these are classed as immature or even self destructive, whereas some are far more healthy and productive. The following are three recommended mature defence mechanisms that you should learn to use, and incorporate into your life; as opposed to the immature, destructive, and self-defeating ones.\n\n**1) Altruism** \\- One of the best and most productive ways to feel better about yourself and to distract yourself from pain is to focus on helping others instead. Ideas: help to feed or clothe the homeless, join an animal rights group, volunteer in a charity shop of soup kitchen, choose a vocation which is concerned with helping people, donate money to a worthwhile cause. Read this article for ideas on random acts of kindness: [https://daringtolivefully.com/random-acts-of-kindness-ideas](https://daringtolivefully.com/random-acts-of-kindness-ideas)\n\n**2) Sublimation** \\- Sublimation means to transform unacceptable impulses into more socially acceptable ones, which are more productive and less harmful. Examples include: take up running, cycling, play a sport, try martial arts, exercise, workout, creative expression such as music, writing or painting.\n\n**3) Gratitude** \\- Perhaps the problem isn\u2019t that we are suffering too much; perhaps the problem is that we are not practicing gratitude enough to counterbalance the bad things in life. As often as you can make a mental or physical note of things that you feel grateful for. These could be positive memories from long ago, recent achievements and accomplishments, or any personal development you have noticed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Quotes**\n\n&gt;\u201cWhen another person makes you suffer, it is because he suffers deeply within himself, and his suffering is spilling over. He does not need punishment; he needs help. That's the message he is sending.\u201d \\~\u00a0Thich Nhat Hanh  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cHow do you overcome the suffering of life?

It is not a force with specific intentions but draws the thinker by virtue of its radiating goodness. It is an aspect of our being that we have largely ignored because we don\u2019t seem to trust our ideas associated with it.  \n\n\n It seems there is reticence to accept that in and of ourselves there is goodness sufficient to compel us to abandon striving for physical dominance.  We feed the beast of our physical being and largely ignore the spiritual.  We are not unlike the horse who forever reaches for the dangling carrot. I would go so far as to suggest the carrot exists simply by virtue of us being physical.   \n\n\nOthers, of course, have similar ideas and so I do not claim any sort of originality of thought here.

I was convinced that psychology could help me find answers to the questions I had about myself and others. And sure, it does provide some answers, but nothing that reaches further than the surface. It still leaves me with unanswered questions.\n\nAnd the universe must have seen this and showed me another path. Just a couple of months ago It opened my eyes and heart to myself, others and the world around me. I realized that the answers I sought was here all the time. Here and now, inside myself and all others. The pain and suffering in my life was caused and created by me, my own Ego gone amok.\n\nI now crave creativity instead of intellect.

It's a nice town, beautiful even. But my heart is begging me to leave this place and move out in the woods. Not completely alone, just to a much smaller village. I feel like nature is calling to me. I want the peace, the quiet, the freedom, the woods and the water. Get a simple job and use my spare time to explore my own creative and spiritual soul. Chop wood and cook food over open fire. I feel like that's where I belong.\n     But my intellect says no. It's telling me to stay and finish my education and become a psychologist *first*, then move. Because then I will be able to find or create a job, and have the financial freedom that comes with it *(psychologists salary is pretty good in Sweden)*. Is that a better choice?

Therefore, O son of Kunti, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain unattached and free from bondage.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nSince one has to work even for the simple maintenance of the body, the prescribed duties for a particular social position and quality are so made that that purpose can be fulfilled. Yaj\u00f1a means Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or sacrificial performances. All sacrificial performances also are meant for the satisfaction of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The Vedas enjoin: yaj\u00f1o vai vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e25. In other words, the same purpose is served whether one performs prescribed yaj\u00f1as or directly serves Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is therefore performance of yaj\u00f1a as it is prescribed in this verse. The var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution also aims at this for satisfying Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. \"Var\u1e47\u0101\u015bram\u0101c\u0101ra-vat\u0101 puru\u1e63e\u1e47a para\u1e25 pum\u0101n/vi\u1e63\u1e47ur \u0101r\u0101dhyate...\" (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a 3.8.8) Therefore one has to work for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Any other work done in this material world wilI be a cause of bondage, for both good and evil work have their reactions, and any reaction binds the performer. Therefore, one has to work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u); and while performing such activities one is in a liberated stage. This is the great art of doing work, and in the beginning this process requires very expert guidance. One should therefore act very diligently, under the expert guidance of a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or under the direct instruction of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself (under whom Arjuna had the opportunity to work). Nothing should be performed for sense gratification, but everything should be done for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This practice will not only save one from the reaction of work, but will also gradually elevate one to transcendental loving service of the Lord, which alone can raise one to the kingdom of God.\n\n**Question 1 : How one can elevate oneself to transcendental loving service of the Lord ?**\n\n[Picture : Bhagavad-gita 3.9](http://gloriousgita.com/verse/en/3/9)", "send_replies": true,

Ya feel me, so don't even try and bottle up those emotions even though its super difficult to do. We can refrain from being oh so drone like with the same exact responses and once you change your response when someone asks, \"Hows your day going.\" Sometimes, just saying how you feel first '' what evaaaa '' can make a big difference. Everyone is and can be your friend, and at the least, they have great potential to help you learn something you never did before, usually this truth is answered later in the future or sooner depending on your potency level of intuition. \n\n/ end daily info\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# START FREESTYLE WRITE then transitioning into the MAIN TOPIC of this post (Why I wrote this post):\n\nBasically, just let things flow, no need for contro, the grass is greener from behind the scenes, being healthy is the best way to go even though i know many y'all don't even, actually y'all probably done drugs at some point. I think there is even a good percentage of or high or above 50% of users in /r/spirituality have probably taken some drug for some purpose. For, drugs can be a catalyst for spirituality growth or even starting to be spiritual or getting to the place of spirituality because its often linked to suffering and pain. I think a lot of us has suffered or had a good amount of pain which led us here. I'd love to hear opinions about what I am writing and provide constructive criticism or you perspective to understand more about others and myself. This post is actually very serious and its meant for learning and observation. I believe with drugs or medications or whatever food sugar etc, should all be used in moderation. Everyone's body chemistry is different, what works for one may not work for another but then their are universal truths like water is the best thing to drink for human, PERIOD! No arguing that its vital and good for cleansing or detoxing and the least bad for your liver. Sweating is great also. So sweat a lot, drink lots of water and you will feel like a new person fast. This is why i picked up basketball. You do gain muscle, its excellent cardio, and just overall well-rounded and also fun distracting you from not wanting to work out in the first place. Many gyms have basketball courts. \n\n# QUESTIONS ABOUT ADHD STUFF:\n\nSo concerning my title, I realized I have ADHD or pretty much something like that, and I have overgrown or overcame a lot.  For those who have this disorder, can you tell me you perspective on what that is like in relation to spirituality? Does it help? What is your general outlook on having it? What do you do for it? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now about regarding ADHD medications:** (I want to learn perspectives from others who have ADHD and take medications. This in no way will sway or condone taking medications nor is this post meant or intended to condone the act of taking drugs or medications. This is all learning other people's experience, history, story, etc. Why? I really just want to learn about this topic. It means something to be about learning truths. That is all! ) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I personally condone moderation, health or plant-based diets, Exercise and water drinking and stretching and expression and not caring about what other people when you express yourself and speak your mind. I'm ALL about inspiriting and motivating others.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you take medications? Do they help, how much do they help if they help. If they do not tell me why. Does taking disrupt your connection to the spirituality realm or consciousness? etc...\n\nThat's all the questions but feel free to add your own whateverness! Its appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Next up is a bit of Golden Truths I have collected, this is just a piece of many other pieces, maybe 3% but this is about life, supposedly they call it the LIFE PROCESS: (they, as, in, youtube comments)\n\n \n\nThis is powerful to listen to: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdl8mpoeG2Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdl8mpoeG2Y)\n\nThis comment I found on YouTube is useful too:\n\n**LIFE PROCESS:** \n\n**Soul** = Fifth Dimension \n\n**Mind** = Fourth Dimension \n\n**Body** = Third Dimension \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Mind is the bridge between your physical perception,\n\nand your Higher Self. \n\nTo be One with your higher Self, you gotta be out of your mind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll starts by the Perception = **Feeling** \n\nfrom the perception you create new Thought = **Imagination** \n\nfrom the thought you create your Reality = **Manifestation** \n\nThe way to mastery Instant Manifestation is to be **single minded.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou cannot avoid your mind, you cannot avoid your Ego. \n\nYou can only embrace all there is as oneness and be mindfulness. \n\nOnce you enter the fifth dimension you're sure to be embraced as **one** **unconditional love with all the elements and bodies**. \n\nYou're called and known as a **multidimensional being.** \n\nThis is where your real life begins and the very purpose of each human being. \n\n**Welcome to the Real World**\ufeff", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 67808, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Have a blessed day today!

Why is everything the way it is. I realized that I knew absolutely nothing. I also had some strange things happening like my body was being put in certain position automatically, body shaking. Also that day it felt as if certain entities entered my head. I spoke with them, I saw them, I would ask they would answer.  \nOn trip I wasn't afraid and somehow was convinced that they will help. Well after the trip paranoia entered my being and I started being afraid and then voics began to be mean. Had it like that for a couple of months but managed to live trough it and eventually I got okay to a point where I would only hear them and saw them (scary images) at night and at worst I would simply have to sleep with lights on.  \nI got pretty used to it..and I continued to do LSD.  \nWell couple days ago I had a trip where I went deep inside my head and one second of fear turned into psychotic break and I had to calm maybe with xanax which I had for exactly this situation.  \nVoices became very mean, when I would allow them to enter my mind on a more severe level, they would distort my reality more and more and I feel that by allowing them that I was simply losing my sanity more and more. I think it would get to a point where I would hurt myself or someone else.  \nAnyway, had a couple of days where I was trying everything. Went to a spiritual healer. Church. People were praying for me. That spiritual healer contacted psychic and she said I had 3 entities in my house. They all prayed for me. I tried everything, I didn't want to go on medication.  \nWell yesterday I realized that I can't win. And I went to get help. And now I'm on meds for schizophrenia.  \nBut these few past days, on moments, I have felt such peace. Gratitude. Like everything was simply perfect. I had a sense that this was my higher purpose. My destiny. I felt like when I allow myself to feel these \"entities\" completely without fear, that I would transcend. That I would die and that something else, something more pure, would be born. I had no desires. I wanted nothing. Everthing was perfect. Even pain. I felt as if everything I have ever experienced - it lead me to that point. It was a gift. I was blessed. We all are.  \nBut any resistance would result in the voices getting mean and me going paranoid crazy.   \nI don't know. I just never thought it would end this way.  \nShould I forget about spirituality and simply see my state as a mental ilness?

I\u2019ve been offered lightly once and now I have another opportunity this Wednesday.  \nMy definition of spirituality is the awareness that you are a spiritual being having a human experience at all times (both being grounded in the physical while understanding the intangible part of yourself at every moment aka being present which is tough). Thereby bringing heaven on earth at an individual level. \n\nThat definition (for me) comes with the belief in a higher power, reincarnation and other spiritual beings. For me, that comes with morals mainly summarized with do unto others as you would do unto yourself and other spiritual practices. I could go on.  \nOn another note, I\u2019m thinking of taking up archery and would like some feedback on that as well from a spiritual perspective focusing on the below five topics if you have time.  \nThe (5) topics I would like feedback on:  \n1. Shooting a gun once and never again.  \n2. Never owning a gun, but going to a shooting range to shoot often.  \n3. Owning one gun and going to the shooting range.  \n4. Owning several guns and going to the shooting range.  \n5. Owning several guns, going to the shooting range and hunting animals with guns only for food.  \nI\u2019ll stop here because I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s ethical to hunt animals for sport. I take a Native American view on that. Hunt for what you need to eat (I\u2019ve never hunted before FYI). It\u2019s sad to see the buffalo (American Bison) almost became extinct in the late 1800\u2019s as a military strategy to choke the Native American food supply. They didn\u2019t even utilize as many parts of the buffalo as the NA\u2019s did. Hell, many times they left them dead in the field.  \nBut I digress.  \nAll options have an increasing karmic effect since my money would be going to support the gun industry. But is that industry responsible for killing like the meat industry clearly is (from a Vipassana Buddhist perspective)? Or is a gun just a tool and people are the ones who make it karmically good or bad?  \nI have traveled all (50) US states by myself and much of the world with others. I\u2019ve never needed a gun and I\u2019ve lived with white supremacists before (AirBnB - disturbing and I didn\u2019t know beforehand).  \nSo why do I want to shoot one?  \nMaybe it\u2019s because growing up the only real criticism others had for my abstention from drugs, alcohol and cigarettes was that I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like. They were right. Back then I judged people to be weak if they partook. Everything else was just others trying to justify their bad habits. I never smoked a cigarette, but I did the other two for just under (7) years starting in college. Then I renounced both for spiritual reasons.  \nMaybe it\u2019s because I want to better understand what it means to be American and a conservative viewpoint.\n\nMaybe I feel it will help me with third chakra problems.   \nMaybe I\u2019m just curious.  \nOne thing is clear - I would\u2019ve be embracing guns because I am fearful or paranoid.  \nLater, I was introduced to a 10-day Buddhist Vipassana meditation retreat. The fifth precept of Buddhism further inspired me to keep my renunciation.  \nThe precept that inspired me to write this is that one should not kill - the 1st precept.  \nI realize there are differing views on becoming a vegetarian to uphold this precept in Buddhism. Just like how there are debates of gun ownership within the Buddhist community. However, in Vipassana I was taught a deep version combined with the fifth precept (no intoxication by drugs, nicotine or alcohol).  \nIf you are a bartender or fisherman, then what you are doing is ultimately immoral at the highest levels of Buddhism. You are helping others break the fifth and first precepts. By even being part of the process (an accountant at a fishing firm) you are generating some level of negative karma.  \nIt reminds me of the Japanese term \"Itadakimasu.\" It\u2019s said before meals as a thank you. But it\u2019s deeper than that. You not only give thanks for the food, but give thanks for the person who hunted it, the people who packed the meat, the delivery truck driver, natural processes that made it happen, etc. One word, but such deep, far reaching gratitude.   \nI was taught in Vipassana that if you eat meat you are breaking the first precept of killing by supporting an industry that kills.  \nWith this large, systematic downstream effect spiritual thinking - what may be wrong with guns from a spiritual standpoint (particularly from a Buddhist standpoint)?  \nI\u2019ll take a stab at it with points 1-5 I brought up above from what I know :  \n1. By shooting a gun once I am supporting the gun industry by buying bullets from the shooting range. Guns can be used to kill people or animals but some just use them for sport. Should that intermingled nature give me negative karma should I shoot a gun? But I am ultimately handing a dangerous, neutral tool (like a knife) to not kill but shoot paper. I am gaining a new experience, but am losing the ability to say I\u2019ve never shot a gun. I can imagine a wild legal situation (maybe I was framed for murder) where I\u2019m asked to take the stand and I have to admit I\u2019ve shot a gun (but never owned) before. That could be used as a line of thinking to convince the jury. Would shooting or never shooting a gun add, subtract or do nothing for my human experience as a spiritual being?  \nYou can also argue (from a Buddhist perspective) that I have an aversion to guns (I do). And I\u2019m Buddhism, all cravings and aversions hold you back from enlightenment. By doing nothing I keep my aversion (I accidentally touch a gun and visibly leave the room). A slower way to deal with this aversion is to keep meditating.\u00a0 A faster way would just be to use a gun and understand why people hold them so dearly.  \n2. Same as the above, but I support the gun industry more. And in the wild legal situation a pattern can be built that I am a well trained shooter. Also, I make create an addiction to the sensation of shooting a gun.  \n3. The positive effect is that if I own a gun it takes that gun out of the hands of another. However, in the wild legal case it becomes easier to show I could be an active shooter. Also, if anyone were to steal my gun I could be framed for a murder. And if I have a legal gun in my car in the wrong state then a cop could pull me over and find me. Spiritually, I\u2019m showing a stronger support of the industry financially and for their marketing team I\u2019m a new customer in X region. But again I struggle. Is buying a knife or (cross, compound or recurve) bow a karmic problem as well?  \n4. In addition to all of the above, now I have a stockpile of weapons.  \n5. In addition to all of the above, now I\u2019m breaking the 1st precept. However, I have the chance to kill the animal quickly unlike the torture of chickens or cows get put through (pumped with drugs, overcrowded spaces, etc). The net suffering I cause an animal is much less than the meat industry. But the hunting licenses I buy further support (wild legal scenario) that I am a well trained, well stocked shooter that has ended life with guns before.  \n**Some Musings on the Long View - Guns and Humanity's Evolution:**  \nI know we are transition from the Age of Pieces\u00a0 to the Age of Aquarius. More empaths are being born than ever to help with this transition to better times. I\u2019m going to assume it doesn\u2019t necessitate World War 3 and build a gun ownership argument out of self protection.  \nGlass half full - let\u2019s say we all become highly moral enlightened being in the next 200 years. Those kind of folks would never use a gun to kill (except in a rare accident). It would seem a gun becomes a tool instead of a weapon for killing in the hands of an enlightened being. Would being spiritual additionally mean never handing a weapon or tool with the potential to kill (John Wick would kill a man with a pencil)?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 67791, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can you shoot guns and still be spiritual?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dvdjzx/can_you_shoot_guns_and_still_be_spiritual/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "KleingreenGeist", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_43inz4at", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573580787, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dvdf7m/weirdmoment_of_clarity/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dvdf7m", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dvdf7m/weirdmoment_of_clarity/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573580789, "score": 1, "selftext": "This morning as I was getting ready to go to school I was in a rush.

But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nPURPORT\n\n.\n\nUnless one is transcendentally situated, it is not possible to cease from sense enjoyment. The process of restriction from sense enjoyment by rules and regulations is something like restricting a diseased person from certain types of eatables. The patient, however, neither likes such restrictions, nor loses his taste for eatables. Similarly, sense restriction by some spiritual process like a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga, in the matter of yama, niyama, \u0101sana, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, praty\u0101h\u0101ra, dhara\u1e47\u0101, dhy\u0101na, etc., is recommended for less intelligent persons who have no better knowledge. But one who has tasted the beauty of the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in the course of his advancement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, no longer has a taste for dead material things. Therefore, restrictions are there for the less intelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life, but such restrictions are only good if one actually has a taste for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. When one is actually K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he automatically loses his taste for pale things.\n\n.\n\nQuestion 1 : Which higher taste of spiritual advancement has been discussed in this verse ?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 67733, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 2.59", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dv7iw4/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_259/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "HasanSonsuz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4uhnbz6s", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573545636, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dv6xv5/sometimes_what_we_seek_is_all_around_us/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dv6xv5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dv6xv5/sometimes_what_we_seek_is_all_around_us/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573545637, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve always chased after love, since the day I was born in fact, but it turns out I\u2019ve been looking in all the wrong places.\n\nI kept on believing that I could only love if the woman I believed I loved would love me back. When women didn\u2019t respond the way I wanted and expected, I beat myself up about it and stopped loving. I decided that I was unlovable, and on top of it all, I blamed my body for women not returning my love. In reality, though, I am here in this world to experience love. Now I think about it, I was like someone who begins a fast with a determined heart, but toward the end, he or she is bothered by the hunger and begins to criticize people who eat, counting down the minutes until the fast can be broken. I am like that person. I try to unite with the source of love through fasting but ultimately become obsessed with eating when I feel hunger pangs from my stomach. It was with this hunger that I lashed out at women. I would flirt with them, court them, and have sex with them, all while believing it was out of love. I only had one aim, however, which was to satisfy my hunger. I felt full for a while with what I gained, so I became calm, but the hunger in my soul was never fully abated. I\u2019d lost my focus, so I had no idea where to look\u2026\n\nIt later turned out that love is everywhere, literally everywhere. As I write this article, I\u2019m inhaling and exhaling love. I had been surrounded by fountains and rivers full of fresh, crystal-clear water, yet I was still crawling around with thirst and begging for water. I failed to notice the abundance of heavenly water around me.\n\nThis naturally brings a question to mind: What is the meaning of love when it\u2019s felt toward someone you find physically attractive? If love is all around, does it mean we should hit on everyone we meet? Of course it doesn\u2019t. Love is not something that other people can offer us\u2014it\u2019s more like a spring whose waters flow everywhere. Sometimes it comes to us through a person, sometimes through a pet or even a favorite plant. Sometimes it may come through an experience or even just through breathing. Now this doesn\u2019t mean you should aim to live your life without a partner. You may meet an amazing being, someone you can share life\u2019s experiences with hand-in-hand, body-to-body, in a way that would be impossible alone. It\u2019s just like adding milk to your coffee. You are the coffee, and your partner is the milk. You each have your own tastes when drunk alone, but when you are combined together, you carry a completely different taste. Yet you will always still be the coffee, and your partner will always be the milk\u2026\n\nYour partner reflects you to yourself. You will grow together, and you will share in everything. You should not ask for such a partner, though, if it\u2019s just to satisfy your craving for love. Imagine meeting the love of your life, but all he or she thinks about is eating and drinking, constantly begging for more food and drinks with pleas of \u201cGive me food! Give me water!\u201d You would only tolerate it for a few days at the most, maybe just a few hours, before running for the door. In some cases, both parties may be begging from each other, yet neither has anything to offer the other. They would end up killing each other, or maybe they would fall into a dependent relationship with both adopting the role of victim and lamenting how no one loves them. All the while, the fountain is right there, ready to satisfy their thirst.\n\nJust because I say this now, it doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019ve been breathing love for years. Not so long ago, I was crawling on the floor and calling out for love, without noticing how the fountain was right next to me. There was a rumor that many people talked about: \u201cThe love you seek is inside you,\u201d but I never imagined anything other than organs like the kidneys, liver, and stomach inside me. Someone then whispered something in my ear: \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere! Just look around you. The world is filled with it.\u201d I stood up and looked around, and I saw the fresh water and delicious food all around me\u2026.\n\nI\u2019ll now feed myself as I begin to walk my path and share my life with love. I\u2019ll share it with the entire world\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHasan Sonsuz Celiktas\n\n[www.thewisemag.com](https://www.thewisemag.com)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 67726, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "Sometimes What We Seek Is All Around Us", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dv6xv5/sometimes_what_we_seek_is_all_around_us/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "maadhavasark", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3vj403mh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573544782, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dv6tjq/our_windows_of_perception_dimensions_unlimited/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dv6tjq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dv6tjq/our_windows_of_perception_dimensions_unlimited/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573544783, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello World !   \nWe humans and our windows of perception are dimensions unlimited along with other life in this lively world.

Keep yourself peaceful , placing cotton buds or earplugs if your surroundings are too noisy , no matter what happens around you one need not get deterred or disturbed. Holds good if one can just sit or stand in a calm and composed state of mind and body. Selecting a peaceful place to do meditation also helps but not mandatory. Keep a dairy and start writing all that you experience while you enter in to the kitikis windows of perception , an experience that is intimate to your own person in physical , metaphysical (that one can only dream and feel) , thought forms , experiences of transformational incidents , makeovers , changeovers , etc anything you perceive as an experience.

Please add more that you find helpful in the comments! \n\n\\&gt;The purpose of words is to convey ideas. When the ideas are grasped, the words are forgotten. Where can I find a man who has forgotten words? He is the one I would like to talk to.\n\n\\-Chaung Tzu, Means &amp; Ends\n\n\\&gt;The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. The named is the mother of ten-thousand things. Ever diserless, one can see the mystery. Ever desiring, one can see the manifestations. These two spring from the same force but differ in name. \n\n\\-Lao Tse, Tao de Ching\n\n\\&gt;The path to Deathlessness is awareness. Unawareness, the path of Death. They who are aware do not die. They who are unaware are as dead. \n\n\\&gt;The man of entangled mind, inebriated by sons and cattle, Death carries away, like a great flood, a sleeping village.\n\n\\-The Dhammapada\n\n\\&gt;All phenomena are naturally uncreated. They neither abide nor cease, neither come nor go. They are without objective referent, signless, ineffible, and free from thought. The time has come for this truth to be realized!\n\n\\-The Tibetan Book of the Dead\n\n\\&gt;Every hour, every minute is changing. If we stop observing change, then we stop seeing everything as new. \n\n\\-Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche\n\n\\&gt;There is evil and disorder in the world because people have forgotten that all things emanate from one source. Return to that source &amp; leave behind all self-centered thoughts, petty desires, and anger. Those who are possessed by nothing possess everything\n\n\\-Morihei Ueshiba, The Art of Peace\n\n\\&gt;And at this point he would infer and conclude that this it is that provides the seasons and the courses of the year and presides over all things in the visible region, and is in some sort the cause of all these things that they have seen. \n\n\\-Plato, Allegory of the Cave\n\n&gt;It is the mountain air. It is the embalmer of the world. It makes the sky and the hills sublime, and the silent song of the stars is it. It is the beatitude of man. It makes him illimitable.\n\n\\-Emerson, address to the Divinity College\n\n\\&gt;You are something the whole universe is doing, in the same way that a wave is something the whole ocean is doing. \n\n\\-Alan Watts\n\n\\&gt;We discover that nothing can be taken for granted, for if this ring of stone is marvelous then all which shaped it is marvelous, and our journey here on Earth, able to see and touch and hear in the midst of tangible and mysterious things-in-themselves is the most strange and daring of all adventures.\n\n\\-Edward Abbey, Desert Solitaire\n\n\\&gt;Freely drifting, I prowl the woods and streams and linger watching the things-themselves. Men don't go this far into the mountains. White clouds gather and billow. The grass does for a good mattress, blue sky makes for a good quilt. Happy with a stone under head. Let Heaven and Earth go about their changes.\n\n\\-Han-Shan, Cold Mountain\n\n\\&gt;You fell from grace when you began thinking, a*bout -* when you became a thinker and a knower. It's not just Adam and Eve, you see, it's all of us. The birth of the mind is the death of the senses.\n\n\\-Dan Millman, Way of the Peaceful Warrior\n\n&gt;I believe in an energy,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It's looking through my eyes, you see  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And listening through my ears -   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Oh what does it hear?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Only itself does it hear  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In everything and everywhere\n\n\\-Nick Mulvey, Remembering\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Light's blinding  \n&gt;  \n&gt;No way of dividing  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What's yours or mine  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When everything is shining  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My darkness is shining  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Your darkness is shining  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Have faith in ourselves  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Truth\n\n\\-Alex Ebert, Truth\n\n\\&gt;All peaks are covered in snow.

Background info that I\u2019m very spiritual and believe in the universal forces, manifestation and etc. \nSo this weekend I attended EDC Orlando (electric daisy carnival) which is a large electronic music festival. Anyways, this festival was 3 days long, in an extremely big park, with about estimated 250,000 attendees. I\u2019ve gone to many music festivals where what I\u2019m about to describe hasnt ever happened before and I\u2019ll probably never see this person again in my life. But this music festival is huge, even finding your friends if you separate is difficult as shit! So this weekend, all 3 days, I ran into the same guy. We either crossed paths at some point or bumped into each other, or saw each other at the merchandise booths. It was very odd to me. I\u2019m not sure if this means anything but these occurrences happened a total of 5 times this weekend (yeah I counted after 3 because it was getting hella weird). Does anyone know if this might mean something, whether it\u2019s this person will randomly pop into my future or something along the lines? I just thought it was very odd and my spiritual belief senses really kicked in when we started crossing paths as frequently as we did. I want to clarify that because this fest is so huge, it seemed very odd and rare that we constantly crossed paths. We weren\u2019t by each other during the same sets either, just crossing paths walking around. I just think it\u2019s fascinating and wanted some other input!!

The next day, my entire wallet got stolen, credit cards and everything.\n\nThen he text bombed me the other day out of the blue after months of no contact. It was random letters and stuff. I figured he was testing me to see if I replied back and to get a conversation going.

In this time I discovered mindfulness practice and began spending much of my days contemplating the life and unbelievable miracle of my own existence. I spent many days sitting outside watching the trees, sky, and birds, and my nights the same. I experienced a few brief moments in this time where I felt all my concentrated awareness accumulated into a great realization that I am, and I exist, and everything else exists. I felt totally connected to the universe (the sky and the stars) and I had a great perception and sense of the vastness of space. I felt like a could literally really appreciate and notice how large and infinite our universe is, just like you can notice how high up you are when you are in a tower, I could sense the distance to the stars and beyond. I also felt totally in the moment and unaffected by the man-made illusion of time \u2013 and rather I felt that this was the moment that is and always will be, and that there Is no rush to go anywhere, as I am exactly where I am meant to be doing what I am meant to do (realizing my existence). I felt great oneness and stillness with my entire environment. I felt a euphoric radiating sensation coming from inside me as this great realization of my life came over me, which was flowing from me into every direction around me (if you can imagine that). Simply put I felt like I really, truly appreciated my life and the fact that I have the chance to be alive. I felt totally %100 connected to my life around me. This took quite a lot of concentration to achieve (albeit briefly).\nLately I have been struggling to reach this feeling again and particularly I feel I am having difficulty connecting with nature. I have been struggling with Anhedonia (lack of sensation/emotion) for years and much of the time my life does not invoke much of an emotional / sensational response within my body and mind. Much of the time I feel as if I am not really a live person living in a real world, I feels a bit hazy and dream like as I do not experience much feelings you get from a nice sunset or a starry night. I feel that my life is slipping away from me at times as I am not able to experience it in a fulfilling way.

Democracies or rule of the peoples came up with more transparent ways of reforming folk and in many cases they contributed greatly to truth and righteousness and met with approval of the divine.\n\nHowever there are trends and methods which are perhaps objectionable and need reform and humankind forever left to joy, beauty and innocence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1) Childbirth by default (man-motivated spiritual consequence)**\n\nIt is after the fall of man that womankind was subjected to child birth and folk with mortality. This has to come to an end. Women's bodies are not to be used for birthing children but for loving (the same goes for all life). Childbirth &amp; birthing children was incorrectly considered a subject concerning national security around ancient Roman times. This happened because the ancient Romans mis-thought that the large numbers of Goths &amp; Teutonic races was the reason for their victories in the battlefield (and their subsequent conquest of ancient Rome). The Tanakh repeatedly stresses the importance of quality over quantity and how victories are not won by men but are a blessing from the Most High God.  If anyone needs reform be they men or women they can be reformed by being given a good spirit and a good environment instead of subjecting them and others to child birth (planned and worse unplanned).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2) Age-ing (man-inspired spiritual consequence)**\n\nThe notion of age-ing or a slow (sometimes non joyful) decline to eternal sleep was introduced in the days of the Prophet Abraham some 400+ years after the flood. This too may be replaced with eternal youth for all, for if folk may meet the eternal sleep it is not necessary that they do so through a slow , non joyful decline. If life must meet eternal sleep decline is not necessary and is an offense against the resources : education, nutritional, financial, material that are spent on the beautification of every member of a society. If anyone has lost their innocence and needs reform they can be reformed by being given a good spirit and a good environment - instead of marking them with physical tags indicating age.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3) Race- harm (man-mandated punitive method)**\n\nThough Adam and Eve and Noah enjoyed and his immediate descendants enjoyed a pangeastic world (a monolithic world with one temperate climate) it came to, that after Noah the practice of race-harm began. Race-harm involves harming members of the single fairest of races (which existed around Noah's time). Some 200+ years in the age of Peleg (a descendant of Noah) the world separated into the continents and climes we see today. Three zones were created :  mediterranea (middle earth) , hyperborea (extreme north or purgatory) and hades (heck). The idea was to darn all the people who met extreme disapproval (were political opponents) by first darkening their visage with charcoal / soot and then by eternal tagging by relegating them to the hottest zones with inhospitable lands, water, flora and fauna. By relegating members of a single - family human race to heck it was hoped that the folk condemned to heck would suffer, become unappealing or suffer from poor health due to the hot climes, poor water quality and air quality and land and animal life. This practice of creating zones for \"burning\" (of trash be it human or inhuman) needs to end and all folk ought to be reformed without doing harm. If anyone needs reform they can be reformed by being given a good spirit and a good environment (interior and exterior) instead of subjecting them to race- harm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4) Sexuality - Bending (man mandated punitive methods)**\n\nThe practice of bending sexuality into asexuality or homosexuality seems to have been practiced around the time of Abraham (particularly with regards to Sodom and Gomorrah). It was revived in some parts of ancient Greece as a human method of encouraging population management. It seems to have met a recent revival for various reasons however it is perhaps not necessary. It is endearing to see folk being loving and kind however perhaps the rest of it is not very necessary. If anyone needs reform they can be reformed by being given a good spirit and a good environment instead of sexuality-bending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5) Gender Bending (man mandated punitive method)**\n\nAttacking genitalia and consequently gender bending was a vice that started around the time of Abraham. The practice of mutilating or incapacitating the genitalia had already begun and Abraham practiced it upon himself and his own children. The more extreme form of genital harm in the form of severing genitalia began to be practiced as folk would turn men into women (eunuchs and further) and women into men (amazons and further). Genital harm or involuntary chemical sterilization and harm seems to be prevalent in the most benighted parts of the western hemisphere today but this practice was eventually banished from the western hemisphere and genital mutilation, genital harm and gender bending became a hall mark of the Orient and the dark continent. In Japan for example there is a legend (dramatized into the classic Japanese film In the Realm of Senses) where a female lover showed her love for her male lover by severing his genitalia and wearing it around her neck. This expression of love seems incomprehensible and strange and foreign to us today as it should to everyone. If this practice of genital harm and gender bending is making a comeback in the West it is partially due to an increasingly globalized world with its negative externalities and negative supply chain spillovers. Again if anyone needs reform they can be reformed by being given a good spirit and a good environment instead of being transitioned into certain genders.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6) Harming in the Guise of Caring for an opponent's Mental Health (man-mandated punitive methods)**\n\nEngaging in harm to the spirit or psyche or the mind by saying, \"I only want to help this person deal with their mental health issues\" has  earliest mention in ancient Greece. In those days the elderly could be divested of their wealth by being accused of senility or having mental health issues and thus deprived of their livelihood and wealth (or be forced into conservator-ship). There are ancient plays where the elderly are forced to defend their mental health by reciting parts of the classics (of Homer and Ovid) to prove to the courts that they were of sound mind and body and therefore did not need the \"care\" and \"protection\" of relatives accusing them of poor mental health.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe recent focus on \"mental health\" can be observed in certain aspects of the entertainment industry in the West where eccentric and \"out of touch\" artists (or even annoying and troublesome or immature celebs) are condemned to and forced to undergo mental health evaluations (and at times forcibly committed to mental health facilities). This practice used to be relegated to the developing parts of the world where people accuse each other of having mental health issues in jest and such condemnations are traded around in daily banter. Again it is making a comeback into the West ever since the end of the cold war due to an increased interaction with parts of the world which use the term \"cr-zy\" or \"ins-ne\" or \"m-ntal\" or \"psycho\" as terms of endearment - and where forcibly committing people to mental health facilities is part and parcel of \"management of peoples\". A manifestation of this vice is people openly diagnosing each other and themselves of mental health issues either out of self-loathing or out of a passive aggressive disapproval of strangers and acquaintances. This practice needs to end in the developed as well as developing parts of the world.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 67434, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Spiritual, Benign Solutions &amp; Not Human Methods", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dujxrw/spiritual_benign_solutions_not_human_methods/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Xx-Dark-Knight-Xx", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4m41xhgx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573430942, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dujwis/440hz_music/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dujwis", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dujwis/440hz_music/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573430943, "score": 1, "selftext": "i meditate and listen to 432Hz but i sometimes bump to 440Hz is that a bad thing it doesn't really effect my mood or nothing cause i balance it out what's your guys input", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 67434, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "440Hz music", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dujwis/440hz_music/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "world_citizen7", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2o0msjd0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573426902, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/duj08f/a_message_to_those_who_might_be_suffering_right/", "gildings": {}, "id": "duj08f", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 18, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/duj08f/a_message_to_those_who_might_be_suffering_right/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573426906, "score": 1, "selftext": "Life may not always be pleasant.

Unlike cells we are far more unique, or perhaps our uniqueness is simply more visible to the naked eye. But still, together we create a field of awareness that, step by step, moves the organism of humanity forward. For us it's a stumbling road and despite the fact that we all form one organism, we fight each other over the direction of where it's going, while some cells wish to overtake the organism completely and lead it to wherever their own selfish needs see fit.\n\nOur collective intention shapes where we will *stumble to* next. Because that is what seems to be happening, besides the wars between the cells, the greed of some and the desire for peace of the minority, the human organism has been *stumbling forward*, stumbling towards a future that to us, collectively, seems unknown.\n\nIf you've been active on the social media side of Internet for a while (especially sites like Reddit), you will remember [Twitch Plays Pokemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon). For those that don't know, it was a fun Twitch experiment where thousands of users on Twitch (a video-game streaming website) controlled the main character in the Pokemon games and tried to get him to the finish line.\n\nI was a huge Pokemon fan when I was younger, I collected the cards and played almost all the Nintendo games associated with the branch, so I definitely wanted to check it out. It wasn't really something you could watch for very long, because it quickly became boring, as progress was incredibly slow. But the whole experiment was actually far more revealing than anything one could imagine. It was, in my opinion, a perfect representation of the human collective hive-mind, the collective consciousness and its corresponding thoughts that led Red to the finish line.\n\nIn a very weird way, the game was an amazing representation of humanity - people crying \"Democracy!\", \"Anarchy!\" (which were built in functions that allowed the players to make decisions in a controlled manner, by the majority [democracy], or through the chaos of all conflicting inputs [anarchy]), not knowing what to do next, yet in the worst of times (Safari Zone) coming together and uniting in order to make actual progress.\n\nIn the end, the game was finished, successfully. Yet the trip was crazy, with plenty of saboteurs and trolls, as well as people genuinely wanting to help in between.\n\nAs humanity, we are moving forward. But as we do so, we struggle, as we cannot make up our mind as to where we are going.\n\nIf we stood together, united in our intentions, we could do so much more. We could change everything. All we really have to do is agree on what we want as a collective, what direction we want to truly go towards. Is it more war and conflict, drama and ego, or is it more peace and compassion? There are only two fundamental paths we can take, that underlie all the other ones - towards war, conflict and separation or peace, love and unity.\n\nHumanity is going to make up its mind. Sooner or later it always does. But what will it take for our intentions to become united? What will it take for us to agree on a path?\n\nAfter the second world war people wanted peace. They didn't want another war. The powers that shouldn\u2019t be cannot create a war if the people of this planet want peace. Obviously, this is very apparent on the physical level - if there is nobody to fight the war, there is no war, as war nowadays still consists of soldiers made out of meat and bones (soon to change perhaps, sadly, with the rise of technology, robotics and AI). If the public resistance towards an activity the entire nation is embroiled in (such as war) is enormous and the support of it small, you better believe that sooner or later either the war will end or those in power will be ended. History has shown us this many times.\n\nBut this is also true, in my opinion, on the metaphysical level, where the very thoughts and collective consciousness of the people will not allow a major, world-war type conflict to arise, if the majority of humanity (or at least all those nations involved) are not in some form of subconscious agreement on it - again, this is usually not even conscious, it is simply a part of the repressed pain in our collective subconscious, pain that has not been looked at, coming out and rearing its ugly head in the physical domain.\n\nSo where are we going now? It is at this point that the human organism has taken a path that seems to be dangerously moving towards the edge of a cliff, towards a fall that may very well injure it severely or end it completely.\n\nHumanity still seems to be in its infancy. Are we ready to make a collective decision for peace without needing a new cataclysm in the form of a world war, an enormous natural disaster (or a series of disasters) or a total economic collapse? Can we decide for peace without being cornered by our insanity? Can we change our direction before we run off the cliff or at least become conscious enough that we don\u2019t kill ourselves during the fall?\n\nCan you?\n\nI write this because we should all be aware of what is at stake and what may await us. WE need to choose peace. You, me, all of us. If we do not, if we choose conflict, if we choose the path of drama, fear and hate, even on our individual level, we are not dooming only ourselves, we are dooming the whole planet.\n\nThus, now, as the world hangs on the precipice, as we hang on the balance between war and peace, chaos and order, health and sickness - I urge you to look within. Look within you and ask yourself - what do you desire right now, for yourself, for your family, your loved ones, humanity, our planet. Do you want war or do you want peace? Do you want more conflict and drama or do you want compassion, unity, cooperation, love?\n\nYou see, the problem is that you think that your choice will only affect you. But this is not so. Your choice will affect us all. Even if you do not believe humanity shares a collective consciousness, you can damn well be sure that even on the purely material level all of humanity is interconnected and intertwined in infinite ways, especially in modern times where through the sharing and trading of goods, information, resources and activities, we have all very visibly become one giant organism. The Internet is another great example of this, a digital web that we have connected ourselves and many of our resources and activities to, where actions that might seem small can alter the course of a person on the other side of the world.\n\nLook within you. Please do so now. What do you want? What path do you choose? What do you desire?\n\nWisdom or ignorance? War or peace? Division or unity? Love or hate? Every man and woman for himself or cooperation?\n\nYour choice will affect how all of this plays out.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n\n#Embracing an Uncertain Future and Cushioning the Fall\n\n\nIf the rest of humanity doesn't choose peace there of course isn't much we can do about it. What we can do is live from a state of peace and freedom, from a deeper sense of self, from our intuition and thus find refuge in what may be some very uncertain times.\n\nThe world in many places is in chaos right now and people have no real idea, even on the internal level, how to proceed. Many are protesting, but aren\u2019t really sure what exactly they are protesting against or indeed what to replace the current system with, if the protests are successful. The trust in politicians and public figures is dwindling, the interest in various conspiracy theories (whether true or false) is rising. Many people are waking up to the knowledge that something *fishy is going on in the background*, but they aren\u2019t really sure what it is, what to do about it, how to proceed and who to trust.\n\nI don't know what is going to happen. I don't think anything permanent has been decided as of yet, I don't think anything is predetermined to happen, whether good or bad.\n\nBut if there is one thing I would advise you to do, it is to [embrace death, it is to embrace your mortality](https://embraceyourexperience.com/2017/02/liberation-facing-death-looking-into-heart-mortality-freedom-that-comes.html) and embrace any disaster, global or personal, that may come your or our way, even the very scent of it. If we look death into its eyes now, there is nothing more to lose. If we face the great fears of death or possible disaster, we can live life more fully. If we accept our uncertain future and accept the worst that may come, we can live fearlessly in the now - in fact we can enjoy life even more if we do so. Because if we acknowledge that hell and chaos may come, we can accept it and thus transcend it. We can face our fears of hell and death and live fearlessly in the now, fully, as if we are to die tomorrow. And funnily enough, this makes it far more likely that our morning execution might just be postponed.\n\nFor the man that knows he only has a set time in front of him, who has no certain future ahead of him, is forced into the Now, forced to do what he always wanted to do, yet was putting off for tomorrow. He is, by virtue of his realizations, moved to think and act in a way that is in accordance with his deeper self, in accordance with greater peace, freedom, rationality and compassion. \n\nWhat is true for the individual is also true for the collective. Only once humanity fully embraces and accepts the chaos it has created and the potential disasters lying ahead can it rationally and intuitively figure out a way to either avoid disaster or at least cushion the fall. Only once the paralyzing underlying collective fear is embraced can courage and positive action seep through.\n\nSo allow yourself to accept an uncertain future of a stumbling humanity with all its fears and dangers and let yourself be thrown into a certain Present that makes no room for putting off a life that needs to be lived NOW.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThis article has also been posted here:\n\n[The Collective Human Consciousness, Our Uncertain Future and Twitch Plays Pokemon](https://embraceyourexperience.com/2019/11/the-collective-human-consciousness-our-uncertain-future-and-twitch-plays-pokemon.html)\n\nMy website for the curious:\n\nwww.embraceyourexperience.com", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 67386, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Collective Human Consciousness, Our Uncertain Future and Twitch Plays Pokemon", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dufoed/the_collective_human_consciousness_our_uncertain/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Are_You_Breathing", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4za87w8o", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573412582, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dufnze/who_could_change_the_worldlpt/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dufnze", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Spirit Guide"}], "link_flair_template_id": "6b76e192-ceef-11e9-820e-0e9c6e8dde10", "link_flair_text": "Spirit Guide", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dufnze/who_could_change_the_worldlpt/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573412583, "score": 1, "selftext": "Setting bias aside, do you believe everyone could change the world for the better, Do you believe every living being could change life or the way we think for the better?

Just wondering what you all think about sexual energy and how it might affect someone on a spiritual level as well as manifestation and things along those lines. Maybe even ideas on how to utilize that energy in a spiritual way? (apologies if this is not in the correct subreddit. might cross post just in case)\n\nI know it can go a lot of ways. I mean it really does seem like a very powerful and profound thing for us to have in this physical form, especially when sharing it with another person. But it gets really confusing on how we should be using this energy. You'd think we were given this for a reason, but at the same time there's these very spiritual people who claim celibacy and think sex just kind of sabotages your enlightenment and whatnot. Given you have the right intentions though, it could also be a positive thing that might even help you on your journey. I've even heard someone mention that there are certain times that you can have sexual experiences in some kind of cycle or something while needing to remain celibate the rest of the time for it to be beneficial to you. \n\nI've been thinking a lot on my experiences lately which has confused me even more. It's really rare I get urges or even participate in sexual acts, but on the occasion that I do, I've noticed something bad always happens in my life afterward. Like the act is manifesting or attracting negative things to me. Although I have been feeling a calling towards celibacy already, that realization has kind of just made me scared to even want to NOT be completely celibate lol. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but this really made me wonder about how should sex be incorporated in our lives..

Nor, having once been, does he ever cease to be. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain.\n\n.\n\n. \n\nPURPORT\n\n.\n\nQualitatively, the small atomic fragmental part of the Supreme Spirit is one with the Supreme. He undergoes no changes like the body. Sometimes the soul is called the steady, or k\u016b\u1e6dastha. The body is subject to six kinds of transformations. It takes its birth in the womb of the mother's body, remains for some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last vanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes. The soul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes its birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die. Anything which has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, he therefore has no past, present or future. He is eternal, ever-existing, and primeval\u2014that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being. Under the impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not at any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man, therefore, feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. The changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate like a tree, nor anything material. The soul has no by-product either. The by-products of the body, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body develops because of the soul's presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change. Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body.\n\n. \n\nIn the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad also we find a similar passage which reads:\n\n. \n\nna j\u0101yate mriyate v\u0101 vipa\u015bcin\n\nn\u0101ya\u1e41 kuta\u015bcin na vibh\u016bva ka\u015bcit\n\najo nitya\u1e25 \u015b\u0101\u015bvato 'ya\u1e41 pur\u0101\u1e47o\n\nna hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015bar\u012bre.\n\n. \n\n(Ka\u1e6dha 1.2.18)\n\n.\n\nThe meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, but here in this verse there is one special word, vipa\u015bcit, which means learned or with knowledge.\n\n. \n\nThe soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness. Therefore, consciousness is the symptom of the soul. Even if one does not find the soul within the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of the soul simply by the presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not find the sun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other reason, but the light of the sun is always there, and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime. As soon as there is a little light in the sky early in the morning, we can understand that the sun is in the sky. Similarly, since there is some consciousness in all bodies\u2014whether man or animal\u2014we can understand the presence of the soul. This consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the Supreme because the supreme consciousness is all-knowledge\u2014past, present and future. The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful. When he is forgetful of his real nature, he obtains education and enlightenment from the superior lessons of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not like the forgetful soul. If so, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 would be useless.\n\n.\n\nThere are two kinds of souls\u2014namely the minute particle soul (a\u1e47u-\u0101tm\u0101) and the Supersoul (the vibhu-\u0101tm\u0101). This is also confirmed in the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad in this way:\n\n. \n\na\u1e47or a\u1e47\u012by\u0101n mahato mah\u012by\u0101n\n\n\u0101tm\u0101sya jantor nihito guh\u0101y\u0101m\n\ntam akratu\u1e25 pa\u015byati v\u012bta-\u015boko\n\ndh\u0101tu\u1e25 pras\u0101d\u0101n mahim\u0101nam \u0101tmana\u1e25\n\n. \n\n(Ka\u1e6dha 1.2.20)\n\n.\n\n\"Both the Supersoul \\[Param\u0101tm\u0101\\] and the atomic soul \\[j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101\\] are situated on the same tree of the body within the same heart of the living being, and only one who has become free from all material desires as well as lamentations can, by the grace of the Supreme, understand the glories of the soul.\" K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the fountainhead of the Supersoul also, as it will be disclosed in the following chapters, and Arjuna is the atomic soul, forgetful of his real nature; therefore he requires to be enlightened by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or by His bona fide representative (the spiritual master).\n\n.\n\nQuestion 1: What are the six changes a body goes through ? Why the soul is free from these six changes of the body ?\n\n.\n\nQuestion 2 : How the consciousness of the soul is different from the consciousness of the Supreme ?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 67310, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the day : Bhagavad gita As It Is 2.20", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/du99qr/verse_of_the_day_bhagavad_gita_as_it_is_220/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Journeythrough2001", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3ua4dkoa", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573367153, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/du7ye8/the_universal_one_soulconsciousness_long/", "gildings": {}, "id": "du7ye8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General"}], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/du7ye8/the_universal_one_soulconsciousness_long/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573367154, "score": 1, "selftext": "Most people think that everything is completely separate in some way.

So scientifically we all have the same origins, that\u2019s if the theory of Evolution and Big Bang is true. However, the bigger question is consciousness, science has yet to figure out what exactly is consciousness and what does it originate from. Some speculate that consciousness is something that has been evolved through organisms, others like me believe that it originates from the universe (God). I believe that all consciousness is actually the universe, and our reality is in fact the one consciousness that is observing itself in many ways. This reality is so complex and it varies differently to other people. We are the manifestations of the universe, in fact everything is if you look at it. We are the universe, except we are evolved organisms that are able to see, think, and comprehend everything that we experience.  We all have believed the allusion that everything is separate, which is understandable due to the vast amount of everything that exists. There are many who are religious and think that the universe is a creation of God, I see the universe as God. If you want you see God look at yourself, if you want to see God look at nature, if you want to see God look at an animal. The universe is ultimately God, and all consciousness stems from it.  We are the same consciousness observing itself, it\u2019s complex in every way and it\u2019s amazing that we have the ability to see, touch, smell everything around us. This is the ultimate reality of everything, consciousness will never end, it is infinite just as our souls are. The consciousness is our soul, and it lives beyond death. That is the other allusion, death. As we are infinite we will experience infinite lives, these lives are not limited to a single form. The law of attraction is true as well, you can manifest anything you want into your reality, because you are the universe and you can create simply because of that. So in a way this life is one big dream as it seems, we are the universe observing itself in different ways, let\u2019s worship the universe, let\u2019s thank the universe for this amazing thing that we call life.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 67295,

I even began a journal of all my thoughts on the nature of life, starting from a very intellectual/philosophical approach but subtly getting more and more personal over time. I felt that it was important to develop these thoughts for myself, but in all honesty I didn't think that there was \"something to find\", just more to keep my mind busy with. \n\nThen, it hit. Late at night in my dorm room, I was doing the usual contemplation, when all the sudden a new train of thought began running wildly out of my control. At its conclusion: an awakening. The raw fact of existence had been brought into my awareness, along with everything that fact implies. I cried at its profundity, and texted my mom (my number 1 confidant) that I'd \"discovered the most important thing humanity can know\". I woke up in the morning, and immediately I asked myself if my discovery was really so profound. Yes, it was - and everyone had to know about it. \n\nFor the next week I went around telling my close friends that I'd \"found the truth\", that if everyone could see it the world would be at peace, that it was the final frontier of the cycle of evolution. All things I still believe today. But this is where I began to run into trouble. I had no idea what I was talking about. I didn't know the nature of my realization, I didn't know what terms it was spoken in, and I didn't know who else knew about it. For a while I thought it was just the philosophers of the Enlightenment period, so I read their works and expounded their ideas to everyone who would listen. I started hearing the realization everywhere, in quotes of Elon Musk and friends' dreams. I started to sound like a crazy person. In front of some social activist friends, I made the bold claim that this realization could save all oppressed and impoverished people. This (understandably) made them very upset. How could such a beautiful thing creation so much derision? Just as my awareness of this experience died down and I began to return to \"normal\" functioning, my faith in what I had discovered had been shaken. \n\nI dutifully continued looking for others who had found the same thing, and was shocked at the range of people who claimed to be awakened. Some were thoughtful individuals who spread the message in order to bring attention to how society could act in a more enlightened way, but many were obsessed with altered mind states and other things I couldn't relate to. Not only was my faith shaken, but I began to completely lose track of what the realization was in the first place. A pure awareness of existence had been replaced with intricate systems of beliefs from multiple different religions and supposed spiritual guides, although I felt no particular connection to them. I was further from the truth than ever.\n\nThis is the danger of an early awakening. None of us can control when or where it will hit, but to come across it without any context for what you've found is a wasted opportunity - and it can lead to complete corruption of the realization itself. I believe this is the issue that psychedelics represent - many people are given the final answer and think they've completed the journey. Because they didn't have the chance to implement an enlightened way of life, they come to the realization without any way of integrating it. Spiritual practices are the the raft which help us navigate from awakening to Enlightenment, but without such well-developed tools one is simply thrown into the river to drown.  \n\nSo, here are a couple warnings I'd like to make to anyone striving towards Enlightenment. \n\n1: Do not focus on awakening. Awakening is a finicky and superficial thing; without the proper life practices it won't serve you. At the top of these life practices are mindfulness and compassion - without them you will not grow from your realization and you will not be able to communicate it. \n\n2: If you have already  experienced an awakening, let go of the experience itself. It is in the past, it cannot serve you. What you should hold on to is the message; this is where faith in its infallibility comes in. Let the message motivate you towards growth. You cannot grow if you hold on to the past.\n\n4: Learn from those who have cultivated a fully Enlightened state for themselves. Don't cherry pick what they say, find every word you can and absorb it - this will stop you from corrupting the underlying truth. The Dahlia Lama (Buddhism), Shunryu Suzuki (Zen), and Lao Tse (Taoism) have been my primary guides, but their readings are complex and secondary interpretations may be helpful. \n\nPlease comment or PM me with your thoughts or questions.

In fact, I have seen miraculous coincidences within my life and was completely fascinated by every one of them! The problem is, I have recently fell into a state of great confusion. \n\nAs the title says, I am not sure what to believe in anymore. I say this because of a couple of things. One of the greatest of those things is other people's experiences with spirituality and how they said that it was demonic. My question is, what if the beings that we communicate with in meditation are demons masquerading as beings of light. \n\nIt's a scary thought, but I have no intention of scaring anyone here, I am honestly just challenging my own beliefs.\n\n Another big one is people's ndes involving hell. From a very young age, I was raised to believe in Jesus and even saw him as a father figure. I remember at 12 years old I saw an entire documentary on hell and the possibility of it existing. It scared the living crap out of me and so I started to straighten my act out and even told my sisters about it. \n\nWhat I'm wondering is, how can so many people experience this hell, if it's not real. One interpretation of many psychics, is that hell is just a place we manifest. How can that be so if people who never thought they would go there, end up there??\n\nAnd speaking of psychics, are these people really just communicating with demons who masquerade as our loved ones? It's just strange to me, If they were born with these powers, then why is it a sin to communicate with spirits in the bible??\n\nI am so confused and scared.

But I\u2019ve been noticing that a strange thing has been happening for the last week now. \n\nAt least once a night, or early morning, I\u2019m woken up by vibrations. To describe it, I\u2019ll be laying down in bed flat on my back when this happens. From one hip to the other, and that whole area, I will be feeling vibrations. This will wake me up and I\u2019ll kinda just lay there half conscious, but enough to perceive it. Other times I am fully awakened and will even open my eyes in the darkness, and the vibrations persist. Like you may be, I was thinking that, well... maybe I was feeling a bit aroused or something. But no, that\u2019s not how the vibrations felt, I know the difference for myself. \n\nI\u2019d like to mention that I have been celibate for about 3 months now.

Do nothing meditation is as raw as it gets. The whole objective is to not react to a single thing anymore. To have complete control over yourself every moment of the day.\n\nNow how do you go about \u201cdoing this\u201d? Well. You don\u2019t. That\u2019s the thing you don\u2019t do anything. You just let your life unfold in whichever way it does regardless of what anxiety\u2019s or worries you have. This is at the heart of spiritual work. \n\nYour body has an internal guiding system that is 20x more efficient than anything your mind can come up with. If you can get past your minds objectives and listen to your gut or intuition, you will get where you want to be way faster than if you try to intellectualize your way through life.\n\nAlthough this is about letting go of control, and not trying to \u201cachieve\u201d some higher consciousness or whatever. You can still practice this in the form of sitting meditation. Here\u2019s what you do:\n\n1. Grab a timer\n\n2. Sit down somewhere.\n\n3. Set the timer for however much time you want.\n\n4. Sit there till the timer goes off.\n\nThat\u2019s all there is to it. That is the most effective way to meditate. This is the hardest thing to do for most people because of strips you away of any sort of goal or objective, (The source of the egos survival system).\n\nWhat happens over time is you will be sitting there and there will all of the sudden be no more need to do it anymore. But this usually comes after you have gone through all your minds objections. \n\nWhen you have pierced the core of your minds objections it is only a matter of time before they are gone for good,

Now I do an hour every day. I can either split it in chunks or do it all at once; just depends on time constraints.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve realized just from the first three days is meditation is about a lot more than quieting your mind. What it all comes down to is awareness. Meditation increases your awareness, and awareness is key in spirituality. You would be shocked at how many unconscious beliefs, ways of acting, and forms of self talk we do which our minds have convinced us are \u201cfor our benefit\u201d even though they really aren\u2019t. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how smart or spiritual you are, you simply cannot change something if you are not aware that it exists. This is true for both changing bad internal and external habits, as well as pursuing good internal and external habits. Awareness really is the key to change. And meditation will help give you that. And the amount that your eyes become opened is incredible.\n\nAside from meditation, two other ways (which I believe are less important but still helpful) are:\n\n- healthy eating (obviously if you eat like shit all the time than this is your first priority)\n- fasting (I fasted for 36 hours and it definitely increased my awareness before and after\n\nThat is all.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 67205, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Contemplating meditating more often?

Do a challenge for 30 days (more or less).\n2. When 30 days have passed, choose if you want to continue the habit or not.\n\nAfter 30 days of doing a habit, it's much easier to continue doing it. **Only at this moment, you are at the right time to consider creating a habit or breaking a bad habit.**\n\nDecide if you want to run a marathon only after running for a month (let's say a minimum of 100km). Only at this moment, you are at the right time to consider running the marathon.\n\nI took cold showers for about 6 months (so far). If 6 months ago someone told me to start taking cold showers for 6 months I would definitely say that he is crazy and then I would go to take a hot shower. **I decided to do it for 1 month, 30 days... why not? I had nothing to lose, and a 30 days period isn't that long.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why does this method work?\n\n* You **take action**\n* You track your progress and **you have a goal** (to finish the 30 days)\n* You can start a challenge **with a friend or with online users**\n* The most difficult part will be in the first weeks, then it will be easier and easier. This is how this method does, **it helps you get over the most difficult period**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I was so fascinated about the impact this idea had on me, that I created a mobile app to let other people do the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Inspired by:\n\n* [Matt Cutts @ Ted Talk](https://youtu.be/UNP03fDSj1U): Try something new for 30 days.   \n*It inspired me to try the things that I always wanted to do, but for some unknown reasons, I never did them*\n* [Matt D'Avella](https://youtu.be/MsSBBPeNNDY): I took cold showers for 30 days.   \n*Before creating the app, I wanted to find like-minded people that wanted to start challenges and also, to track my progress on a nice calendar (preferably a mobile app).

Confused and scared, my doctor diagnosed me with Severe Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason for my attacks. I would be triggered if the lightening in my bedroom seemed a bit \"off\". This went on for 2 years and it got so bad that I stopped leaving my house. My only outings were for doctors appointments and therapist appointments. Going on to year 3, I was numb and felt broken. (Looking back on it now, I think my narcissistic husband preferred me like that. It's easier to manipulate the pieces than it is to control the whole) I no longer knew who I was. I couldn't tell you my likes or dislikes. I no longer felt joy watching the sun set or looking up at the stars. I believe I was now going through a depression; however, I was never diagnosed. One day, I found myself sitting outside listening to the birds and I started to cry. I spoke aloud to my deceased grandfather \"Please help me. Show me a sign. What do I do? Please, please, please\". And wouldn't ya know it, the signs were everywhere! A single butterfly stayed with me for weeks. It sat beside me as I meditated, flew circles around me as I spoke to it, saying \"Thank you, Grandpa\". I felt seen. I felt heard for the first time in 5 years. The next morning I woke up and it was like a switch had been flipped on in my soul. I didn't feel like me, because I wasn't me! I had drifted so far from my authentic self; trying to please my husband, never speaking up or against him. A lot of toxic and negative things happened in my relationship throughout the years, but lets just put a fork in it lol.   \n\n\nSo I ended it. I needed to heal and rediscover myself. And I needed to go on this journey alone. So here I am. Moved back to my parents house with my dog and $200 to my name. And I haven't felt this happy in years. My smile reaches my eyes again, I'm laughing louder than I ever have before, and I am so excited to see where my path will go, while trying my best to be present. I just seem to be a little stuck. How do I move forward on my healing journey? Has anyone experienced a similar situation and would you be willing to share your steps of healing? As I was very isolated, I don't have many friends and I'm looking forward to meeting like minded people!   \n\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and share. This is my first post!

By using this significant word, Arjuna indicates what will satisfy his senses. Although Govinda is not meant for satisfying our senses, if we try to satisfy the senses of Govinda then automatically our own senses are satisfied. Materially, everyone wants to satisfy his senses, and he wants God to be the order supplier for such satisfaction. The Lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as much as they deserve, but not to the extent that they may covet. But when one takes the opposite way\u2014namely, when one tries to satisfy the senses of Govinda without desiring to satisfy one's own senses\u2014then by the grace of Govinda all desires of the living entity are satisfied. Arjuna's deep affection for community and family members is exhibited here partly due to his natural compassion for them. He is therefore not prepared to fight. Everyone wants to show his opulence to friends and relatives, but Arjuna fears that all his relatives and friends will be killed in the battlefield, and he will be unable to share his opulence after victory. This is a typical calculation of material life. The transcendental life is, however, different. Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing. Arjuna did not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he desired that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a kill them personally. At this point he did not know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that he was only to become an instrument for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This fact is disclosed in following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord's plan that they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees. Therefore the Lord was determined to kill the miscreants, although Arjuna wanted to excuse them\n\n.\n\nQuestion 1 : How the difference between the material life and transcendental life has been exemplified in this verse ?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 67134, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the day : Bhagavad gita As It Is 1.1", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dttil7/verse_of_the_day_bhagavad_gita_as_it_is_11/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "hiddenoctave", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ufj502b", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573288234, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dttcyf/trying_to_understand_fathers_that_obsess_over/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dttcyf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dttcyf/trying_to_understand_fathers_that_obsess_over/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573288235, "score": 1, "selftext": "This is an article that I have written in light of the recent controversy with Rapper T.I and his paranoia over his daughters hymen. \n\nNot that I agree with him, but this was my way of attempting to understand him as well as all fathers that freak out over their daughters having sex.

All you must do is prove me wrong. God has given me a perfect way for all to live as free and happy as it is possible, as God promised. I will gladly admit if I can be proven wrong, this did not come of myself. This is what I had to first understand, \" God Is Everything\". That is the most important part. God Is Everything. Once you realize that we are all one with God, you will start to see him more clearly. We are all equal in His eyes and that's how we must treat one another. The way He has given me to understand his law is this, \"Do Nothing That Negatively Affects Another Person\". The plan for us all to live this way will start with this, \"We Must Rid Ourselves Of Money And Laws Of Oppression\". All who work will be provided everything they need to live however is best for them. At the age of 55 you may choose to retire (this is just based on how fragile our bodies are right now) or continue working. Everyone will have 3 month's of vacation to use. Ask yourselves this \"why do we work, do we not work so we may enjoy our lives. And does one person that works deserve to enjoy their life more than another?\" All jobs in each city will have an online jobs list for all who choose to work. All vacant houses will be online for those looking to change location. Any one that chooses to live this way will receive what they want and need. The more people working the less amount of hours we will have to work. All jobs are something we do for the good of others, all jobs that are not for the good of this world or others is a job of iniquity. Many jobs only exist because of money, how many can you think of? Those are works of iniquity. A job is something we do for others, not something we do for ourselves. What job that one person does is any more important than another? Everything we need or want is something that another person provides for us. This includes chef's, nurse, doctor, peace officers, furniture maker, factory worker, landscaping, farming, pilot, fireman, e.m.t., carpenter, stock boy, painter, roofer, cement workers, framers, interior designer, architect, road worker, mechanic, inspector, electrician, and so on...  Everything that we need or want is a job for someone, no one will be without a vehicle or home as long as they work. We learn to love one another this way, we shall do our work for the good of others and not ourselves. For those that are unable to work will be taken care of so they may enjoy their life to the fullest (it would be some ones job to do this). And those who choose not to work and are able to do so can live freely off the land but they will get nothing from those that do. God does not like the lazy. That is all I will give, if this way of living can be proven wrong then I will accept it gladly. I believe all must understand as I did so we must remove all doubt about God and to do that you must question. I do not claim to know anything, He has shown me that I know nothing so I am open to any intelligent discussion about any flaw you can find. This is a very simplified version of what the actual way of living will be so just imagine it and read the bible. I know it will be hard to understand, God was speaking to me and I argued with Him. I know you may think I am unstable, but nothing scares me more than not doing God's will. When he speaks about the watchers being punished for not coming forth at their time that scares me. I do not want to be punished for understanding as I do and not coming forth. And just to spark your imagination, what did we gain by eating from the tree of good and evil?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 67123, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How God's Way Will Fix The World", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dtsl3d/how_gods_way_will_fix_the_world/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "halfwaythere333", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4wwqqbh5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573282052, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dtsirc/can_someone_please_share_any_astrological/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dtsirc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dtsirc/can_someone_please_share_any_astrological/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573282054, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm at a enstranging point in life. without family or friends, I could really use some perspective on what I'm feeling. if any of you is so kind and has the knowledge to share, it would be appreciated", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 67122, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "can someone please share any astrological highlights going on?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dtsirc/can_someone_please_share_any_astrological/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "BlakethaReaper", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4uttfw6k", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573278294, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dtrz31/your_day/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dtrz31", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dtrz31/your_day/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573278295, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey, I just wanted to say, you're amazing, you are good enough, you have a purpose you are loved \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9a have a great day", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 67114, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Your day", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dtrz31/your_day/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "blindapprentice", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4t4jdxat", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573275002, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dtrg20/free_tarot_readings/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dtrg20", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dtrg20/free_tarot_readings/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573275002, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi, I would like to practice my tarot.

I think if there is a God, even He doesn't know if there is a God above Him, and so on. Because how can he? See that's the whole point. If you look at things logically, there is no end to it. But then there is the non-logical way of looking at life, the mystical point of view. I dabble with that too. But really I know a bit about spirituality. The twin flame thing is real. We are in fact souls. I just don't know if incarnating is our own choosing or not, or what else can influence us into incarnation. I mean, a soul must come into a fetus when the conception is made. There is no other way. But see, what if no soul wanted to come down into that body? Clearly even incarnation is not always in our control. There is so many souls and forces out there. As for the topic of suffering, it seems  that suffering shouldn't even exist, but it does. so this makes me ask the question: why does it happen? do animals who live short unfulfilling lives because of being eaten, do they have an afterlife? we humans do, that's for sure. But I want to make sense of the topic of suffering. I want to understand why it happens, and maybe some understanding will explain it to me.

shadow entities questioning me, electrocuting me, trying to brainwash me, and scare me every single night.\nat first i saw glowing lions in little worlds, one told me to keep my head up and stay positive with telepathic thoughts and then it sent me back to bed. the second time i had a shadow entity encounter where i escaped them by calling for jesus. since then, ive figured that those experiences were clearly just the people trying to fool me, to allow their torture world to continue by indoctrinating me with brainwashing to make me feel complacent with things being less than the best they could be. this is the only thing they try to do.\nall of those experiences, i theorize are inside of these little video game worlds that these people can make. that would explain the inconsistency. they were just trying to psyche me out the whole time to confuse me.\nwell, basically, the idea of life is to have something good exist instead of nothing. and only the most high good is right to exist. lesser things are wrong to exist, at any goddamn time. this idea of life is actually the highest authority, it is god.\nHEAR ME: spirituality, the concepts, are all complacency propaganda. we have no business being in this lesser world, we are not spirits. we are just normal people like the atoms of this world. there is no such place as the non-psychical. the higher world is infinitely more psychical than this one because its home to the production of a higher element. oh whats that?

I'd really like to explore with him so I'm just trying to get out ahead of it as best as I can and be prepared mentally!\n\nThanks for the info all!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false,

We will be starting Bhagavat-gita Verse by Verse exercise again from 13th Feb 2020.\n\nTill then, let us go through some important verses from the Srimad Bhagavad Gita\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nDhrtarastra said: O Sanjaya, after assembling in the place of pilgrimage at Kurukshetra, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do, being desirous to fight?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPURPORT\n\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the widely read theistic science summarized in the G\u012bt\u0101-m\u0101h\u0101tmya (Glorification of the G\u012bt\u0101). There it says that one should read Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and try to understand it without personally motivated interpretations. The example of clear understanding is there in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 itself, in the way the teaching is understood by Arjuna, who heard the G\u012bt\u0101 directly from the Lord. If someone is fortunate enough to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in that line of disciplic succession, without motivated interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, and all scriptures of the world. One will find in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 all that is contained in other scriptures, but the reader will also find things which are not to be found elsewhere. That is the specific standard of the G\u012bt\u0101. It is the perfect theistic science because it is directly spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\nThe topics discussed by Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and Sa\u00f1jaya, as described in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, form the basic principle for this great philosophy. It is understood that this philosophy evolved on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, which is a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the Vedic age. It was spoken by the Lord when He was present personally on this planet for the guidance of mankind.\n\nThe word dharma-k\u1e63etra (a place where religious rituals are performed) is significant because, on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, the father of the Kurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons' ultimate victory. In his doubt, he inquired from his secretary Sa\u00f1jaya, \"What did my sons and the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du do?\" He was confident that both his sons and the sons of his younger brother P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du were assembled in that Field of Kuruk\u1e63etra for a determined engagement of the war. Still, his inquiry is significant. He did not want a compromise between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kuruk\u1e63etra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas as a place of worship-even for the denizens of heaven-Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra became very fearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this would influence Arjuna and the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du favorably, because by nature they were all virtuous. Sa\u00f1jaya was a student of Vy\u0101sa, and therefore, by the mercy of Vy\u0101sa, Sa\u00f1jaya was able to envision the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra even while he was in the room of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. And so, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra asked him about the situation on the battlefield.\n\nBoth the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra belong to the same family, but Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra's mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his sons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du from the family heritage. One can thus understand the specific position of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra in his relationship with his nephews, the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du. As in the paddy field the unnecessary plants are taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the religious field of Kuruk\u1e63etra where the father of religion, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was present, the unwanted plants like Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra's son Duryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, would be established by the Lord. This is the significance of the words dharma-k\u1e63etre and kuru-k\u1e63etre, apart from their historical and Vedic importance.\n\nQuestion 1 : Why the word dharma-k\u1e63etra is significant in the context of this verse ?\n\nQuestion 2 : How Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra partial charecter towards the sons of Pandu is revealed in this verse ?\n\nPicture : Bhagavad gita 1.1Picture : Bhagavad gita 1.1", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 66988, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the day : Bhagavad gita As It Is 1.1", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dte254/verse_of_the_day_bhagavad_gita_as_it_is_11/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "spiritualscientist01", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4oj8fv0n", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573204254, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dtcvir/negative_emotions_and_desire/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dtcvir", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dtcvir/negative_emotions_and_desire/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573204254, "score": 1, "selftext": "**Behind every negative emotion (Anger, hatred, jealousy, greed, fear,..),** there is a **desire/expectation unfulfilled.**\n\nAnger comes when one **seeks/desires/expects too much of perfection**.\n\nWe have **set concepts** about the things that they should happen this-this way.

So I don't even know why I'm even posting on here. I guess to give this one last shot. Obviously by the title this post is gonna be why I don't know if I can believe in this stuff anymore. But first let me give a little backstory.\n\nSo I've had a dark past. I was abused in childhood and this causes me to have a pretty pessimistic outlook on life. I have really bad depression and anxiety that eats away at me. I was raised in the south and grew up in a Christian environment. Now I have nothing against Christian people, but Christianity in of itself as a religion has so many things I disagree with. I wont go into everything because that would take too long, but I am very against homophobia, having sex only when you're married,  the concept of free will, and I'm especially against having blind faith in something. Or worse, having faith in something because you're afraid of going to hell. \n\nI first started getting into spiritual stuff through watching tarot videos on youtube. Also a close relative of mine is obsessed with astrology and introduced me to the subject. I liked how accurate my birth chart was on describing my personality. Same with the tarot readings I would watch. That's when I got introduced to concepts such as spirit guides and ascended masters and angels. I read on how we all had these beings around us and how they're always there for us and will always give us love and comfort. As a victim of abuse love and comfort don't come easy to me, so the idea of having something that would always be there made me feel extremely happy and at ease.  \n\nFrom the beginning I've had many doubts. The breaking point for me was recently I was watching this series on netflix called the mind: explained (it's a really good series I highly recommend you check it out) and there was an episode about astrology. They did an excellent job describing astrology and its history, they even went into birth charts and not just your sun signs. However, they then explained how astrology is just a placebo effect. There isn't any scientific evidence to back it up. There have been numerous tests and they all come back false. \n\nI know the placebo effect can have many benefits. Even if someone knows something is fake if they believe in it, it can still have positive effects on a persons life. But I don't want to believe in something that has nothing to back it up. I don't trust anecdotal evidence as that can be disproved fairly easily. Plus, it's depressing to see the new age movement doing harm. People who do tarot readings/astrology/psychics who scam others for money. Anti-vaxxers have caused some diseases to make a comeback and flourish. \n\nLike I said in the beginning I'm not sure why exactly I'm posting this. I want to believe in this. I really really do. But how can I believe in something that has been disproved over and over again? If any of you reading this had any helpful advice I would gladly appreciate it.

I realized that wordly desire is normal, but in order to be free you have to get rid of the desire that infects most of us - the desire for completeness, or to get somewhere you're not. This is what the Buddha was talking about when he said \"desire is the root of suffering.\" He was not arguing that we shouldn't desire good food or other forms of enjoyment for the purpose of enjoyment itself.\n\nThe entertainment industry has played a huge role in creating this desire for people. We feel this need to get somewhere in order to be happy because ever film follows the hero's journey to salvation, or shows the hero meeting the man or woman who completes them, or at the very least shows the main character living a life that is implied to be awesome and something necessary to strive for in order to be happy. And so we've all developed this feeling of needing to get somewhere. Its a belief.\n\nSo I sat with this feeling for a while, trying hard to make it go away. Then I realized the very act of trying to make this feeling go away was the feeling of desire itself. And so I let go a little more. And now I'm writing this a little while later, still feeling that desire in my chest.

I\u2019ve been venturing into different types of spiritual practices since I was twelve going from Buddhism to reiki to Wicca and everything in between. But anyways, I\u2019m asking for advice and to see if I can get a little more clarity in this situation. \nIve been dating this guy for a year and almost two months. At the time we met (on tinder) I was looking for my soulmate but I have always known that he\u2019s not it. That summer I had gotten so many tarot readings, psychic messages and sings in general that I would be meeting my soulmate or my true love but I met him. And don\u2019t get me wrong we have a really nice relationship it\u2019s just that he is not a very spiritually evolved person which makes it\u2019s kind of difficult for me to grow and evolve. We\u2019ve broken up twice now. First time he called it quits first then I absolutely agreed and he regretted it, begged me to go back and agreed to it only if the relationship got better. It did until this week that we\u2019ve broken up for the second time. I was just feeling drained and not taken care of by him so I expressed it and he decided to break up because he couldn\u2019t give me what I needed. After a full day of being sad I texted him and he said he had thought stuff through and he had many realizations in terms of our relationship and his self care and spiritual growth. I genuinely think there is prospect for growth and more nurturing experiences in this relationship before it is actually over but I don\u2019t know whether I should get back together with him or not as I\u2019ve been getting mixed messages. On some tarot readings I have had I get told to move on and in others that letting go would open so many doors for me and allow me to meet my soulmate. I just don\u2019t know what to do.

But even so, regardless of pain or love, it feels like fear is irrelevant. Everyone and everything are just unique expressions of the same source. No more should I fear any person or thing than should my middle finger fear my pointer finger.\n\nI then come to the notion, is not fear part of experience, and thusly a valuable part of the source coming to understand itself? Just now I have tried on for size the idea of fearing myself. I felt a strong revulsion, literally physical pain at the base of my skull. This would seem to me a sign that I shouldn't pursue this line of thought as it contradicts the idea of living authentically. \n\nThen I come to the idea, well is there a race of peoples out there who are racked by fear and are a necessary part of the creator coming to understand itself fully? \n\nJust some thoughts!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 66917, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "If life and all of the universe is a carefully calibrated way for the creator to know itself...", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dt7thl/if_life_and_all_of_the_universe_is_a_carefully/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "twitchhutton", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4u4dprha", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573166044, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dt5m3t/crazy_experience/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dt5m3t", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General"}], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dt5m3t/crazy_experience/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573166047, "score": 1, "selftext": "I am here writing this so I can share this crazy mediation experience I just had.

Our perception is linear, because we walk and look in one direction at a time, even though life happens in every direction in a single moment. As for time, we live in one moment and move within that one moment.\n\nWhat this really means is that everything we perceive as \u201cpast\u201d lives actually exists alongside us. In fact, our souls exist with all their aspects at the same moment. There\u2019s the \u201cme\u201d in Rome, the \u201cme\u201d on the Viking longboat, and the \u201cme\u201d in the Turkish War of Independence. All these \u201cme\u201ds are there, whether I remember them or not, and they all exist within that single moment. This is true for each and every one of us. At this moment of time, I think I\u2019m Hasan \u00c7elikta\u015f, but in fact I have innumerable faces. In this, we are similar to the solar system. Our essence is the Sun, and our different aspects are the countless planets, satellites, and other celestial bodies. And of course, there is the universe with all its galaxies, and this is the spiritual existence\u2026\n\n#### Parallel Universes\n\nThere is also the presence of parallel lives within a structure that we find rather complex, yet this structure resembles a beautifully woven piece of cloth. This is a festival in itself. Parallel universes branch out from all the decisions that we do or do not make. There are different universes where different common decisions were made. Furthermore, there are also universes that have nothing to do with us\u2026\n\nHas anyone mentioned infinity yet? Can you tell me anything that cannot exist within that infinity? I am certain so much exists within this infinity, but we have not yet found the words to describe them. On this planet of ours, we are given five million pieces of data per day, but we can only process two million of these, the ones we can perceive with our senses, so we create our universe around us. Sure, our brains can only process the universe\u2019s stimulation if we can perceive it with our senses, so we live within this universe and assume it to be the only truth. But what about the rest of those five million pieces of data? Who knows what exists in the infinite universe. So much exists on all those small planets. That\u2019s why I keep saying that the only answer to the multiple-choice question of the universe is the final option: All of the above, meaning ALL.\n\n#### How Do \u201cPast\u201d Life Therapies Work?\n\nWhen you take part in a past-life therapy, such as regression or a light bridge, what you\u2019re really doing is trying to find where the first blocks are. These represent the problems you are affected by and unable to solve. Those problems actually affect you in your current life, but the blockage could be from this lifetime or another lifetime. When you clear a blockage, you also remove it for all your lifetimes. In a way, you could say you\u2019re not just healing your past but also your future.\n\nThere is always more in the universe. In another ten years, who knows how much I will have experienced and shared? The words of this article are just those that I felt and discovered at that given moment. They may not mean much to you.

I\u2019ve always liked the imagery of Satan, demons, and anything dark and macabre. I never put much thought into it except loving horror movies and Halloween. But recently, I\u2019ve had a feeling of want. Like that\u2019s where I want to be. I\u2019ve had violent thoughts and dreams about people. Last night I had a dream where I choked this woman to death. I could literally feel her throat crush in my hands. I woke up feeling weird. Like I actually killed someone. Before that, I\u2019ve become a lot more apathetic towards people. My mom just got into hard drugs and I\u2019ve passed her a couple times on the road where she\u2019s walking. Do I stop to pick her up? No. Fuck her. She made her choices and I don\u2019t want to around her. My uncle is about to die due to health problems and I literally don\u2019t care if he dies or not. He\u2019s not a bad person, I just don\u2019t care. In fact, it will make my life easier. I\u2019m counting down the days for my grandparents to die as well because they\u2019re leaving their house to me and I\u2019d love to redo it. They\u2019re amazing people too, but everyone dies sometime. I\u2019ve had thoughts about ways of killing people. Not anyone specific, but people in general. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll actually kill anyone, because I\u2019m not really a violent person, I just think it\u2019s interesting. I\u2019m more than likely sure it has to do with my house burning down the day after I break up with my long term partner because he was talking to someone else for a long time.

I\u2019d like to take a little time out of your life to talk about me.. us?\n\nSo let me benchmark myself real quick. I see the numbers, speaking into existence, I\u2019ve had the warm connection feeling a few times with and without psychedelics, and I\u2019ve been noticing these events where I talk to someone (familiar and unfamiliar) about life.\n\nThese happenings are common in subject. Usually starting off with me asking someone how they are, then going to subjects about giving love and mindful understanding. In a world where many seem to be upset and hateful towards the world and others for no apparent reason, recently I\u2019ve caught myself and tried to be a more kind person. Kind examples such as, not being upset in traffic because other people may have more urgent tasks they have to tend to. Or even with my personal self, like being late and not getting flustered because maybe if I was on the road any earlier, then the universe wasn\u2019t ready for me and I could end up in a car crash. Mainly things to keep my \u201cgrounded\u201d within myself to maintain my mood.\nI\u2019ve actually realized that some people actually acknowledge this energy I\u2019m outputting and appreciate my presence more.\n\nSo the more I think in that way, the more these happenings occur. More numbers, more conversations about life, and more synchronicity moments. Speaking of synchronicity, I have this friend that I love dearly. We we\u2019ve been good friends since grade 5. But recently (past year or two) we\u2019ve been having more synced occurrences. One recent example is that he has a Juul, and another friend gave him a sticker that he put on it. Well the other day I said \u201chey cool sticker\u201d and as the exact moment i touched the sticker, he got a text from that friend. We\u2019ve had many other things happen to us just like that. Lol I know he\u2019ll be in my life for a while.\n\nI\u2019m in class right now lol and I\u2019m feeling like this could go on an on about all the things that happen to me. But I\u2019m here for my overall question. What can I keep doing? New or different? I know we all have our different books, but what have you all been doing to keep going? I feel like we all experience somewhat similar...

I would also like to mention that I formulated the whole text in German and had it translated from a website. If something reads bumpy, it could be because of it. And I also considered in which subreddit this text would fit best. I think here.  \n  \nOne of the most important things is undoubtedly the development and cultivation of mindfulness. Without mindfulness you don't know what is happening inside and around you. Without mindfulness, you won't know what actions lead to pleasant or unpleasant experiences, such as what is important to free yourself from unhealthy habits and to pursue things that are important to you. There is so much more to write about, but mindfulness is definitely a key to liberation.  \n  \nThen I want to emphasize the importance of intentions. From various completely different sources, such as mindfulness, and now also from personal experience, intentions are very important. What are your intentions?  How often do you realize them and keep them in mind? In Buddhism, the intention is crucial whether what you do is healing or unhealing. Makes sense to me, also experience-based. A simple example I can think of would be the homeless person asking you for money. Either you give something or you don't. Why? What are your intentions? And how do you feel about it, what do you perceive? Observe yourself. For example, I have found out that for various reasons I feel most comfortable when I unconditionally and without thinking about it give some of what I currently have with me. Out of benevolence and generosity. And also to condition my mind accordingly, to set impulses.\nSomething may seem \"good\" to the outside, but the inner intentions may be \"bad\". What matters is not so much what you are doing, but with what intention you are doing what you are doing. Do you want to be helpful even when you don't feel like it? Would you like to practice living more consciously and attentively? Or be friendly and compassionate? Calm and grateful? Trusting and confident? Do you want to learn and develop? \n(e.g. Why do I write this article? Do I want to inspire, help, share or do I want attention/upvotes? Do I want to teach, convince, missionize? Or a mixture or something completely different?)  \nIntentions can be consciously chosen and maintained. e.g. friendliness, serenity, react to unpleasant things with acceptance and compassion, and so on. etc. I once wrote down what I wanted to cultivate as basic intentions - what are your basis intentions? How would you like to meet yourself and others and the ups and downs of life in all its facets?    \n  \nThen I would like to highlight compassion. More precisely, I mean loving kindness, Buddhist metta.  Here you develop and cultivate the wish that you and all other beings may be well. You practice meeting yourself and other people with kindness, compassion, forbearance, leniency, benevolence. As well as mindfulness and intentions, this subject has a transforming effect.  \n  \nI also find the meaning of (not-)wanting and attachment exciting and similarly important. According to Buddha, the basic cause of suffering is \"the attachment to the desire to have (craving) and the desire not to have (aversion)\". Here I would like to add that attachment does not only mean the desire (not) to have, but also that you want it to be fulfilled. I find demarcation and differentiation important. Learn to let go of the clinging to the fulfilment of the will. If you can also be satisfied with not getting what you want, you gain freedom.   \n  \nI almost forgot gratitude. The development and cultivation of gratitude. Gratitude is an expression of appreciation and satisfaction with the present state. Being grateful for a warm, soft bed. For warm water, healthy sense organs. Be grateful for the huge selection of food. Be grateful for the availability of knowledge. Practise being grateful for the small and obvious things.  \n  \nI find the following things worth mentioning in this whole context, I make it a loosely disjointed enumeration:\n * Letting go identifications &amp; expectations    \n * &gt;*(...) So stop devoting your life to avoiding pain. (...) You must learn to overcome the tendency to avoid pain.\"*  \n * Do not resist, do not avoid, do not judge, do not presume, do not take personally, do not want to be right, do not cling/hold  \n * Love your humanity, your inadequacies, your weaknesses, your corners and edges, your ego  \n * Forgive the mistakes of yesterday, be grateful for today  \n * Basic trust (that all will be well), letting go\n * Devotion\n * The heartwarming Buddhist Metta-Sutta  \n * Breathe &amp; smile  \n  \nI have certainly forgotten some things, e.g. I could still talk about the importance, usefulness &amp; meaning of meditation. Or about the ego, or about impermanence, or let go,  that might be too much and too incoherent. However, this is an excerpt from my personal collection of wisdoms. I hope I was able to help or inspire someone. What do you think? Stay tuned, you are not alone!

Not only what it is, but also, more germane to the board, how it can be an extremely  effective tool for spiritual growth.\n\nFirst, the definition:\n\nA practice of draining the life- force/energy/essence of another and using it to sustain yourself, or empower yourself, or grow.\n\nThere are also psychic Vampyres, which are beings Who for one reason or another do this constantly either out of need or due to their nature gravitating towards it.\n\nOne need not be a psychic vampire to utilize vampyrism. Anyone can, in theory do this. Everyone has done so at Least once, and often more on average.\n\nWhen we are weak, we tend to drain more.\n\nNow, of psychic vampires, 2 types exist: latent and awakened.\n\nThe latent one is unaware they are draining others. To their and others detriment.\n\nThe awakened one is aware they drain, and thus drain with more control. Their friends and family are safe, often exceptionally so. Their enemies are often drained viciously.\n\nIt is possible to protect against it, and I know there are those who believe they do not exist; they are free to think that way.\n\nNow, as for spirituality... By feeding you consume the essence of that target, and can become more like them if you are not careful... Or intend this. You can also simply evolve from exposure to new essence.\n\nJust as one grows from exposure to the energy of a stone, a rune, a God, a daemon, a plant, a place, a song.\n\nThis is purer, more concentrated, however.\n\nA vampire may do this unwittingly and devour without regard for the character and taste of another's essence, just as one may drown a fine wine in sprite and suppress the taste. Or they can quaff another humans essence like a vintage wine, savouring the taste and texture and learning from it.\n\nIn doing so, one learns to grow from all they eat, appreciating the soul of the fruit, the vegetable, the animal.\n\nOne comes to understand the predatory aspects of life and spirituality, which are so rarely touched on or explored with any real depth, despite how fundamental this is to our existence. To live requires we consume the life force of others.\n\nVampyrism is really not that different from eating a vegetable or animal, once you see past the species bias. Life force is consumed in either scenario- only we don't have to kill the food when,we practice vampyrism.\n\nVampyrism can promote, and even demand compassion and empathy too, developing and growing it. Though we are prone to think it a purely selfish act, it actually works better if you can honor and accept fully what you do to your target.\n\nA very unique form of empathy, and compassion.\n\nIt drives home the reality of how connected we all are, but in a very different way than conventional spirituality.\n\nIt is a taboo path, a Dangerous path, but a powerful one. The risk is equal to the gain.\n\nIt is taboo for good reason; society dislikes anyone having real,, uncontrollable power.\n\nA psychic vampire can hurt in a way that cannot be legislated against. Cannot be proved. Cannot be stopped by most humans. One that embraces aspects of our animal nature we strive so hard to deny.\n\nBut it is all the more insightful for that. It reveals truths no less important than conventional spirituality.\n\nIt strips us of delusions that few humans ever realize are in fact delusions.\n\nTrue, it can fuel ego And delusion, but so too can regular, conventional spiritual paths.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 66569, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Psychic Vampirism as a form of spirituality, not merely parasit8c behaviour", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1573110148, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dscpkt/psychic_vampirism_as_a_form_of_spirituality_not/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "unlucky980", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_23dvg0nl", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573022338, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dschjv/moments_of_bliss/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dschjv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dschjv/moments_of_bliss/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573022339, "score": 26, "selftext": "Anyone else just stare at trees and get this over urging sense of calm and your mind goes blank.

For this reason, I want to share 2 ways that helps us build our self-worth, so we can better understand our value and live a happier life!\n\nI've made a video about it here:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T92S7kBdBRg&amp;t=23s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T92S7kBdBRg&amp;t=23s)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr if you prefer reading:\n\n1. Step Outside of Your Comfort Zone\n\nOne reason we may have low self worth is because we don\u2019t believe we deserve good things in life. We don\u2019t believe we our worthy of a good job. We don\u2019t believe we are worthy of a good relationship. We don\u2019t believe we are worthy of a good body.\n\nAnd if we are being honest with ourselves, a lot of times we have these beliefs, because we are afraid. We\u2019re afraid when we CHANGE something in our life and step outside of our comfort zone that we will fail or others will criticize us or that we will ultimately get hurt. And a lot of those fears most likely come from our past experiences\u2026whether you had someone make fun of you, or you were pressured to perform well in school by a parent, or you experienced some major financial hardships or you\u2019ve had some sort of trauma.\n\nSo, any change we even THINK about doing, our brain says \u201cHOLD UP! STOP. Don\u2019t even think about doing that because it might hurt you.\u201d Our brain automatically tries to protect us from the unknown, because it doesn\u2019t want us to experience pain.\n\nHave you ever gotten the urge to dance at a social event when the music comes on and then your brain says \"NOPE. STOP. PEOPLE WILL MAKE FUN OF YOU.\" Or have you had the urge to go talk to someone new and your brain says \"STOP. THAT PERSON\u2019S NOT GOING TO LIKE YOU. STAY AWAY.\"\n\nOur brain acts like a bodyguard. Which isn\u2019t a bad thing, because it\u2019s doing its job. Right? Our brain wants us to experience pleasure and not pain.\n\nBut it can REALLY get in the way when we want to make a positive change that\u2019s actually good for us, so we can get what we deserve in life.\n\nSo, how do we break that pattern of the brain automatically saying \u201cNOOO. DON\u2019T DO THAT OR YOU WILL BE IN PAIN!\u201d?\n\nWe say..\"Thanks brain, appreciate you trying to protect me, but I got it from here.\" (like in the movies...when someone rocks up at a super wealthy person\u2019s house and a bodyguard appears, gives them a hard time because they\u2019re being very protective, and then the wealthy person is like\u2026\"Thank you Alfred, I've got it from here\").\n\nSo when we say \u201cWe\u2019ve got it from here.\u201d WE take control of our thoughts instead of letting OUR MINDS run the show.\n\nWe INTERRUPT our brain pattern of automatically telling us \u201cNO\u201d whenever we want to make a change.\n\nAnd that makes us feel pretty good, right?\n\nBecause WE\u2019VE gained control and WE\u2019RE going to tell our brain how WE run things around here.\n\nIt\u2019s when we gain that control, that we can then take one small but courageous step forward towards what we deserve.\n\nWe take one step outside of our comfort zone into the direction we want to go. Then when we complete one step, we take another step. And another step. And another step. Until we reach our ultimate goal and get what we deserve.\n\nAnd it may feel a bit awkward or scary at first, because we\u2019ve been listening to our brain tell us \u201cNO\u201d without doing anything about it for a VERY long time.\n\nBut after that first step, I promise you will feel so accomplished and SO proud of yourself that you could do that.\n\nAND ultimately You deserve happiness. You deserve whatever you want in life. It\u2019s all about just taking control of that brain trying to protect you, and letting him know \u201cThanks..but no thanks. This step forward in my life will actually bring me WAY MORE happiness than where I\u2019m at right now. And I\u2019ve got it from here.\"\n\nThe next way we can increase our self worth is by\n\n2. Stop Comparing Yourself to Others\n\nSO. MANY. TIMES. we try to measure up our worth by comparing our life to someone else.\n\nWe think\u2026\n\n* They have a better car than me, so I must not be good enough\n* They have a smaller waist than me so I\u2019m not good enough\n* They have more money than me, so I must not be good enough\n\nAnd it\u2019s the BIGGEST LIE EVER.\n\nDo you know the odds of you being alive right now are 1 in 400 trillion? 1 in 400 trillion! Do you know the chain of events that had to happen for you to even exist? You have WAY more of a chance to win the lottery than being alive right now! And we spend our time being ALIVE by comparing ourselves to someone else and not feeling good enough?!\n\nThat\u2019s not living my friend.\n\nYou are SO special and SO needed in this world. Your unique ideas and views are NEEDED in this world. You have a major ADVANTAGE IN life JUST by being YOU, because there is not one person on this planet that has seen or experienced the world like you. Which means, NO ONE is going to have the same strengths or talents as YOU.\n\nSo, instead of comparing ourselves to others, let\u2019s start looking inward and being in tune with ourselves and ask..\u201dWhat actually makes me happy and what makes me feel ALIVE?\u201d And go do that. Because You deserve to make the MOST out of this one life you have. Not wasting it. by comparing yourself to others and trying to achieve what they have, because you think THAT would make you more valuable.\n\nJust by being you, you 1 in 400 trillion person, that is valuable enough! :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 66512, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How to Increase Your Self-Worth", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1573087487, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ds8hv7/how_to_increase_your_selfworth/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "MountainChair", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_38hq01c8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572999070, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ds82ew/angel_reading/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ds82ew", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/ds82ew/angel_reading/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572999071, "score": 3, "selftext": "Can anyone connect with my angels?

How did you work through it? I'm sure some of it is karma/karmic baggage/karmic imprints...etc. But that's why I have this life now, to work on it, and its not easy, but I am trying.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, I joined a healing forum online -- mostly the community honestly, and connection. I was quickly removed before I could post, and told \"you aren't appropriate for this forum.\" My mind went to work with the awful scenarios:\n\n&gt;*Am I possessed? Have I been invaded by a walk-in? Am I being controlled by the dark forces? Is an ET attached to me like an Atari?! What did they see? Have I been 'tagged' in someway?* \n\nIt was very sad for me. There was that feeling thinking something must be wrong with me, and for a while, put me in a heavy state spiritually and I'm finally on my way out of it. This came on the heels of a very tumultuous time for me:\n\n&gt;*Sudden loss/separation of my healing mentor. Two cancer deaths this year in my personal life. Ending of two other close relationships (10+ year). A sudden unexpected move. Separating from my family to work on my mental/spiritual/physical health (coming from an co-dependent, abusive, and enmeshed family group).* **Very plutonic stuff.**\n\nBut I've had a lot of great things happening as well as well -- moved to a great place. Have been super creative and  fairly successful in business. Learning a lot about healing myself. While I do think it's possible that I experienced some soul loss this year, I thought to speak to two intuitives.\n\nThe last one I spoke to laughed hysterically when I told her I was waiting for her to tell me my life was falling apart, and that I am being consumed by the dark, and she just said \"well I ain't gonna tell you none of that, that, so get over it.\" What she did say, was:\n\n&gt;You are always trying to kind of hide your light under a bushel, and beat yourself up, and put yourself down. You are constantly picking yourself apart. I think you are suffering from PTSD, and a lot of anxiety from trauma you went through this year, and won't give yourself a break -- some of this is childhood trauma. \n\nI know I have a lot of 'stuff' to work on -- which is why that is why I like hearing about the 'bad' so I can address it.

Then I fell for a girl and my ego came back full force. Over the next 10 years I tried to get back to that place, but it wasn\u2019t the same. Id have days of total presence, but they would quickly come to an end. Over that time, I found many spiritual teachers, consumed many books, and tried so hard! And here I am, nowhere.\n\nI know all the cliche advice, like \u201cyou can only be enlightened now\u201d or \u201cpresence takes no effort.\u201d But whether I try or don\u2019t try, whether I practice or don\u2019t practice, my life doesn\u2019t change. So, many times I\u2019ve given up the search completely;however, something always pulls me back on the path.\n\nTonight I was with a girl and talking about all these synchronicities and weird spiritual things that have been happening. Then I realized, holy shit I\u2019ve been taking life so seriously. Like so fucking seriously. Spirituality has become my life. I have become obsessed with destiny, fate, what I\u2019m suppose to do, synchronicities, and some sense of higher power guiding me. Now, I\u2019m not denying that these things exist. But I just realized, damn I\u2019ve been taking life so seriously and I know this isn\u2019t what spirituality is suppose to be right? I know my life isn\u2019t meant to be painful, lonely, and a means to an end. Or is it? I honestly can\u2019t decide anymore. \n\nI know I probably sound insane. But if you\u2019ve been through what I\u2019ve been through over the last few months you\u2019d understand. The amount of synchronicities, signs, etc are so overwhelming that I\u2019ve begun living FOR them. And I still feel like that\u2019s my destiny. To find my purpose, to awaken, etc. And yet, I also feel like this is bullshit how serious I\u2019m taking everything. If this incarnation is so serious, then what the fuck is the purpose of life? Just to find your destiny, perhaps suffer so that others can prosper, try and try to awaken, etc? Or is it to have fun? Because honestly I\u2019ve given up all forms of fun. I set ZERO goals for myself anymore. Everything a normal person would see as fun I don\u2019t do because I feel it gets in the way of my spirituality and I\u2019m not serving my duty to god. Again, I know it sounds insane but just for the sake of this post at least pretend what I\u2019ve experienced is legit, cuz I know it is. \n\nI want to enjoy life and live it to the fullest, but I feel I am not doing what I\u2019m suppose to be doing by doing so. Idk. Just had to post this. I need feedback.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to say \u201clife is about having fun too,\u201d try to remember that what I\u2019ve experienced over the last few months, how my intuition has guided me, etc, I am literally at war with this belief. It\u2019s not just hearing that life is about fun. It\u2019s actually finding a reason to believe it. Of course I have fun all the time. But what I mean is I don\u2019t set goals for myself. I don\u2019t push myself. I don\u2019t try to make a lot of money or friends or find a passion, or anything.

However, we all must understand that this \"collective sin\" of sorts, to which quite many of us are contributing unconsciously anyways, is a very necessary phenomenon that is part of the Great Plan. \n \n \nWithout all the ignorance and Hedonism that seems to be happening everywhere globally in our present age more than ever before during the history of man, we probably would not get the incentive to transcend it to the Next Level of it all, which is renunciation of all worldly pleasures in pursuit of the Knowledge and Love which ultimately has the power to lead us all to GOD.  \n \n\nI can sense a general wave of purposelessness among many young people these days, many of whom fall victims to unlimited Hedonism or a deep pit of Nihilism before they have the chance or resources to actually figure out what they wish to do with their lives. Which isn't bad in a way: some people NEED that dark, endless pit to finally get a feel for their own limitations, to get an idea of where they are and what they actually wish to transcend once they decide upon changing and having a purpose. Some people simply need to lose themselves fully before they can find their True Selves.  \n \n \nI myself have been a victim of many false notions and pleasurable recreational states before I finally got so lost that I allowed anything to happen to me, and this limitless behaviour allowed for the entrance of real change into my life, something that I can only call a Deus Ex machina, or a divine intervention. I HAD to go down that dark road of being completely lost to find the Eternal Light that ultimately gave my life bigger purpose than ever before. \n \n \nThis Light is intimately linked with Fire, and Fire, I'm confident enough to say, is a manifestation of GOD. Fire is instant change, burning down each living element to the most basic form of itself, which is usually carbon, the most basic material requisite of all Life. And this is precisely what is happening everywhere in the world right now: The Fires are burning everywhere. I don't even watch television or the news, but whenever someone else does and I'm around them, all I seem to hear is that fires are burning a lot of great things to crisp. And I'm not talking about just the Amazon rainforest, it's literally happening everywhere, regardless of location. As long as fire has the capacity to manifest, it seems to manifest more often and with more intensity than ever before. \n \n \nNow I'm sure that I've said this before, but many of the things I say on here might be so raw to digest for the overly rational mind that it simply refuses to hear any of it and denies whatever I say as pure psychotic nonsense. And that is exactly why I seem to get attacked or questioned more and more, by trying to convey the actual stance of things in the most unadulterated fashion, I seem to create such a bold image to many of the overly rational types on here that they confuse my message with arrogant outbursts of the ego-mind. Let me say that I have no other purpose on here than to teach anyone who's willing to learn in the purest fashion possible. I attain no material gains out of this, nor do I seek to get any power over anyone. True Surrenderance does not question, it does whatever needs to be done.   \n\n \n\nWhat I can say for certain is that we don't have much time. Even I,  just a few years ago, wouldn't have dared to imagine that I'd get to see the Apocalypse unfolding right in front of me, in this lifetime. Yet it is happening right now, and people are still denying it despite all the signs and revelations which have been made clear to quite a few people by now, including me. The Apocalypse is just an old Greek word meaning the Age of Knowledge. We definitely needed our collective acts of ignorance to get to the Truth, we had to go to sleep before we could learn how to dream awake. This may sound controversial to some, but I am completely overjoyed by the fact that our Planet is burning as we speak. This holy Fire that many seem to only recognize as \"mindless destruction\" is what will actually burn us all back to GOD, collectively I might add. \n \n \nA great amount of collective suffering will(and already does) precede the complete annulation of Life as we know it on this Planet. We use up the Earth, our playground of pleasures to the maxiumum before the pleasures cease and the next stage will be put into motion, a process of complete purification, a period of great suffering, which will only hurt as long as we don't submit to it. Once we see through all the lies and false hopes that the remaining ignorant people of the world try to feed us, we will all change our standpoints and rejoice in the fact that the Fire is not actually destruction, but a doorway to Rebirth and Purity.  \n \n \nTake this piece of information as it is, to those who are unconvinced, nothing more needs to be said, for when the time comes, everyone will see the Truth portrayed in it for themselves regardless of their beliefs and rationality. And to those who truly wish to know, let them know this information as their own, and plan the remainder of their lives accordingly. Let's all rejoice in the fact that the End is near, for it is actually the Beginning of something new and beautiful, something that has the power to burn us all a little bit closer back to God.", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at how fast our collective ignorance and our addiction to things like comfort, pleasure and power has brought us to a world changing more rapidly than ever before, a civilized world which took many thousands of years to build, now falling to pieces as it crumbles under our weight of ignorance, the weight of an addicted species.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thought that may come to many people&amp;#39;s minds as they presently see the destruction of the Planet and many of its inhabitants is, &amp;quot;how dare our species destroy everything on this great Planet just to feed our own pleasures and comforts!&amp;quot;. However, we all must understand that this &amp;quot;collective sin&amp;quot; of sorts, to which quite many of us are contributing unconsciously anyways, is a very necessary phenomenon that is part of the Great Plan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without all the ignorance and Hedonism that seems to be happening everywhere globally in our present age more than ever before during the history of man, we probably would not get the incentive to transcend it to the Next Level of it all, which is renunciation of all worldly pleasures in pursuit of the Knowledge and Love which ultimately has the power to lead us all to GOD.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can sense a general wave of purposelessness among many young people these days, many of whom fall victims to unlimited Hedonism or a deep pit of Nihilism before they have the chance or resources to actually figure out what they wish to do with their lives. Which isn&amp;#39;t bad in a way: some people NEED that dark, endless pit to finally get a feel for their own limitations, to get an idea of where they are and what they actually wish to transcend once they decide upon changing and having a purpose. Some people simply need to lose themselves fully before they can find their True Selves.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I myself have been a victim of many false notions and pleasurable recreational states before I finally got so lost that I allowed anything to happen to me, and this limitless behaviour allowed for the entrance of real change into my life, something that I can only call a Deus Ex machina, or a divine intervention. I HAD to go down that dark road of being completely lost to find the Eternal Light that ultimately gave my life bigger purpose than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This Light is intimately linked with Fire, and Fire, I&amp;#39;m confident enough to say, is a manifestation of GOD. Fire is instant change, burning down each living element to the most basic form of itself, which is usually carbon, the most basic material requisite of all Life.

Should I feel comfort? Mostly I find myself being curious and wishing I had someone to talk to about it without sounding crazy.

I felt this completeness inside of me and I opened my eyes and was on my bed but I had been crying I had to wipe tears away.\nI was overwhlemed and didn't fully understand, after thinking over it I feel like it could be mother nature there was this compassion but almost maternal feel when she spoke every word brought a feeling she was a master of her self she had such strength but also elegance and I felt blessed to be able to meet who ever she is.\nMy other theory could be she's my spirit guide who watches over me or is apart of me or just my spiritual complete form ( i only say this because of what i was saying to her) but I honestly have no clue I'm just so glad I can remember it so well please leave your opinions in the comments:)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false,

God's image and likeness and have dominion over all things. This is the inspired teaching, and it is intended to be taken literally, at its face value. The ability to draw on this power is not the special prerogative of the mystic or the saint, as is so often supposed, or even of the highly trained practitioner. Everyone has this ability. Whoever you are, wherever you may be, the golden key to harmony is in your hand now. This is because in scientific prayer it is God who works, and not you, and so your particular limitations or weaknesses are of no account in the process. You are only the channel through which the divine action takes place, and your treatment will be just the getting of yourself out of the way.\n\nAs for the actual method of working, like all fundamental things, it is simplicity itself. All you have to do is this: **Stop thinking about the difficulty, whatever it is, and think about God instead**. This is the complete rule, and if only you will do this, the trouble, whatever it is, will disappear. It makes no difference what kind of trouble it is. It may be a big thing or a little thing: it may concern health, finance, a lawsuit, a quarrel, an accident, or anything else conceivable: but whatever it is, stop thinking about it and think of God instead - that is all you have to do. Do not try to form a picture (or concept) of God, which is impossible. Just think of God.\n\n It could not be simpler, could it? God could scarcely have made it simpler, and yet it never fails to work when given a fair trial. But you must stop thinking of the trouble (or your idea of a solution), whatever it is. The rule is, to think about God. If you are thinking about your difficulty, you are not thinking about God. To be continually glancing over your shoulder in order to see how matters are progressing is fatal (counter-productive), because it is thinking of the trouble, and you must think of God and nothing else.  Do not try to think in advance what the solution to your difficulty will be. **Leave the question of ways and means to God.** You want to get out of your difficulty that is sufficient. You do your half, and God will never fail to do God's.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 65909, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Golden Key", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572839803, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dqvhdt/the_golden_key/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Hizzy98", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2rtkfyiw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572750492, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dquz84/how_can_we_truly_not_care_what_other_people_think/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dquz84", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dquz84/how_can_we_truly_not_care_what_other_people_think/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572750496, "score": 3, "selftext": "I read the four agreements and it says what people think of us is only a dream , of their interpretations of their own dream", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 65903, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How can we truly not care what other people think of us ?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572836873, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dquz84/how_can_we_truly_not_care_what_other_people_think/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "cleo1844", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3og1pip4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572750320, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dquy3e/am_i_the_i_or_the_me/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dquy3e", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dquy3e/am_i_the_i_or_the_me/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572750322, "score": 1, "selftext": "I keep flipflopping.

One of the key points in the book is how staying in the present moment relieves suffering.\n\nI'm reminded of how sometimes connection outside of the present moment improves my life experience. One example is picking blueberries. Picking lots of little blue round things off bushes on a very hot, humid and sunny summer day and putting them into a bucket doesn't sound fun. I'm pretty sure the suffering involved there somehow gets relieved via meaningful connection outside of the present moment.  In other words, if the activity was totally useless to myself and others, even indirectly in terms of things like getting paid or approval from others, then it would probably be much less enjoyable. I'm pretty sure it's mainly a positive experience due to connection outside of the present moment, like eating them later, sharing them with others, making a pie, eating that, and also other things involved on those days, like going to the beach after. I can think of other examples where physical labour which seems unpleasant on its own can somehow be a pleasant experience.\n\nAnother example is taking a photo. If I was simply going to take a photo and then delete it, I expect that would be less enjoyable than sharing and storing it.\n\nIn a way it seems like the opposite of what Eckhart Tolle is suggesting. That makes me wonder if this is something addictive which also brings non-obvious pain into my life. But it doesn't seem like that, and I suspect that it can be a good thing.\n\nIn another way, it doesn't seem like an opposite. It is a kind of expanding the concept of self, just like how the concept of self can be expanded in some enlightenment-like experiences. Though it certainly can be a selective kind of expansion, unlike enlightenment-like experiences where one seems to become the universe.\n\nThis also makes me wonder about some kinds of seemingly very unpleasant experiences which are very different from anything I've experienced, like \"dying for your country\" in war. I wonder if the sense of meaning in that experience somehow partly relieves the suffering and makes the experience better than what one might assume observing it externally.\n\nI wonder if there's a spiritual element in this phenomenon. Does it involve some real kind of connection to other people, or can pure fantasy relieve suffering? Like, suppose you imagine a totally bullshit kind of meaning, like picking useless inedible berries with the false belief that you're going to make a delicious pie which you will share with imaginary friends. I guess you could call that delusional meaning. Can such delusional meaning relieve suffering just like real meaning, showing it's all in your mind and there's nothing spiritual about it?\n\nAnother way to approach this question is computer games. Imagine you're playing some game totally on your own. The stuff you're doing has no purpose other than in terms of working towards an objective in that game. The objective might be what wins the game, but it's useless in terms of a broader perspective in life. I know people can enjoy that kind of thing, and I've enjoyed it myself. What I'm wondering about is whether such enjoyment is unavoidably lesser than the experience of doing something more meaningful in life.\n\nCertainly evolution ought to favour meaningful work. An organism which does useful things has a clear advantage over another which does useless things.

Yet we wonder why we can\u2019t be free, and it\u2019s because as long as there\u2019s a me, there is duality. There is had and good. There is threat and opportunity. It has taken me a long time to see that the last step is dropping me. It is recognizing that every time we use the word \u201cI,\u201d we are referring to something that is perceived, and therefore is not \u201cus.\u201d It is stepping back from the sense of \u201cme.\u201d It is seeing it for what it really is and continuing to observe the \u201cme\u201d as just a thought - something that occurs in the awareness. The me is the hardest of all things to drop. It is even something that people choose not to drop when given the opportunity. Because when you drop \u201cme,\u201d you also drop all of your goals, all of your dreams, you drop your journey as a human, you drop your spiritual path, you drop this road you\u2019ve created for yourself, which has given you purpose. It has made life feel safe and secure and worth it despite the crazyness we experience all around us. The \u201cme\u201d is terrified of losing all these things. And yet, if we ever wish to be free, this is what me must drop. We must begin to disidentidy from the one thing we hold dearest. The one thing that allows all of the other ideas we have about ourselves to exist. And yet, it\u2019s hard to even consider dropping it because it\u2019s one of the strongest illusions we\u2019ve been given. But once we begin observing the \u201cme,\u201d or the \u201cI\u201d And the way in which it is embedded in each of our thoughts, we begin to realize I am not that! \n\nThe mind will say, \u201cI finally see, I finally see!

He always would be by my side when i\u2019d be lonely. Sometimes i asked him if it could rain tomorrow, or another day in the week. And sometimes he would grant me the rain i wanted.\nSometimes i asked him if i could have a little breeze, and he would cool me down a bit.\nI always greet him in the morning, and he greets me back.\nAnyway, without much help (because of how little there is), i started to get a feel for my relation with the wind. I tried to manipulate it a bit, but i couldn\u2019t really do much, except make it blow stronger. Eventually, the wind became part of my regular life, and my subconscious. Sometimes i see me raise my hand when one of my sheets is about to be blown away, and i barely stop it from going away further. All that without me consciously thinking about it. I\u2019ve tried many times to do stuff consciously but i don\u2019t really get too advanced.\nSo, today i decided to isolate myself in a quiet place in nature and to meditate a bit.\nI was in a good mood. The wind around me was strong, though i didn\u2019t have much of an impact on it.\nI tried to manipulate it a bit, moving my hands, and using energy manipulation.\nI really had no idea what to do, and i felt awkward. I decided i\u2019d stop thinking about what to do, and tried to feel it.\nI stood up, tilted my head backwards, took a really deep breath, and opened my arms towards the direction the wind was coming from.\nI felt its intensity get bigger. I could feel its strength, its energy.. i could feel it inside me. And then i thought.. i don\u2019t know why..:\n\u00ab\u00a0I surrender to you, great wind. Let me be you. I want to be part of you, to unite with you.\u00a0\u00bb\nAnd suddenly, i felt something in my hand. I opened my eyes: It was a leaf. The wind had carried it into my hand. It didn\u2019t just touch my hand. It was strongly pushed into it. My hand was open, the wind blowing strong, and the leaf was still inside it. I took the leaf, emotional, and looked at it closer. It was a yellow, small, regular, but to me, beautiful leaf. There was something special about this leaf. I\u2019m not very good at feeling energy, but i knew it was special.\nI then pressed it against my chest, kneeled, and said \u00ab\u00a0thank you\u00a0\u00bb\nI felt like i was at peace. With me, with the world, with all the things around me.\nEverything was so intense.\nI then left the place, and ran my way home, the leaf still firmly inside my hand.\n\nWhat do you guys think ?\nWhat should i do with the leaf?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 65786, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I received a gift from the wind", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572789160, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dqkgbh/i_received_a_gift_from_the_wind/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Sepulchritudinous", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_11hq7j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572702162, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dqkbt9/how_do_you_meet_conscious_people/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dqkbt9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dqkbt9/how_do_you_meet_conscious_people/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572702163, "score": 8, "selftext": "Hi\n\nSo, a common problem seekers and spiritual people deal with is that sense of isolation. It's hard to find people who are mindful and conscious, people who are into spirituality or magick or whatever mind-expanding and esoteric stuff you're into.

There used to be a few more, but we fell out of touch. I met them all years ago on a forum that no longer exists. Until recently, I also had a wife of this type. Us meeting was a matter of chance, and she reached out to me on that same forum and we eventually met in person and spent a few years together.\n\nThese were all \"chance meetings\" or people that reached out to me after reading my posts on the forum. I've never had a spontaneous meeting like this in real life or found some place to reach out to people.\n\nNow that I'm alone again, I'm feeling a big lack in this area. I have nobody to practice these things with. I'd mainly like to meet some people in real life, for friendship or romance or whatever, but I have no idea where I'd go. I mean, I could travel to a place like the sacred valley and find some people to hang with for a while, but that would only be a temporary thing.\n\nNew internet friends would also be cool though. But I don't know how to establish that kind of contact anymore these days.

We weren\u2019t in a relationship, we just hooked up for around 3 months, but it was an intense experience for me (I don\u2019t know about his side). During our sex, I would lose count of my orgasms. I remember telling him that it\u2019s not just multiple orgasms, it\u2019s a continuum of unstoppable pleasure. I\u2019ve had tons of memorable hook-ups with extremely skilled guys before him, but what I felt with him was utterly unique.\n\nBut this is not the reason for me thinking he\u2019s my twin flame.\n \nI ended things between us after I started getting paranoia and drama queen about him getting tired of me. To this day I still don\u2019t know if I was right, but anyway, after our break-up, I was devastated but not depressed. I knew with an inner certainty that this isn\u2019t the end. \n\nI started doubting everything else though. I started seeing some flaws I\u2019ve never seen in myself before. I began an intense journey within and now after about two years, I\u2019m nowhere near finishing but I\u2019m definitely a different person. I even live in a different city now, far from him.\n\nHe made me trigger back to another version of me. He reminded of me of the dreams and ambitions I had as a child. He made me snap back to reality and pick myself up. I doubt that he has any clue he\u2019s done these though cause none of them was something that he did, but they were the result of how he was. I saw him, as he was and how he was living his life, and I remembered how I wanted to live my life. \n\nLooking back, I feel like everything I\u2019ve done throughout these two years have been an attempt to restore that asleep version of me, but also an attempt to get ready for him. I haven\u2019t forgotten him and I find myself thinking of him more and more the further I continue this journey within.\n\nYet... I still have my doubts. If we are twin flames, how-come all these are one-sided?! I know he enjoyed his time with me but I have no idea if he enjoyed it as much as me. And I have no idea if I had any impact in his life.\n\nSometimes I wonder, maybe I\u2019m just fooling myself?! Maybe I haven\u2019t moved on and I\u2019m still hooked on his drug so I\u2019m making up all these to justify my obsession with him?! Maybe just the fact that he pops into my meditations means that I\u2019m not doing this journey right?! \n\nHow can I be sure to trust my intuition if I can\u2019t even tell if it\u2019s my thoughts or my intuition?! \n\nWhat is your advice?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 65781, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "When a hook-up changed your life and you wonder if it was a twin flame experience", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572786619, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dqjy4f/when_a_hookup_changed_your_life_and_you_wonder_if/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Thedivineplan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4gmhc1bw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572699714, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dqjufa/message_from_your_higher_self_along_with_a/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dqjufa", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Self-Promoting"}], "link_flair_template_id": "e4fe724c-8418-11e7-8ef1-0ee29c473ac4", "link_flair_text": "Self-Promoting", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dqjufa/message_from_your_higher_self_along_with_a/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572699715, "score": 1, "selftext": "Message from your higher self along with a message from your divine Counterpart's higher self. \nMy intention is this message gets to those who need it.\n\nYou will need to go to Instagram to see cards \n\nBoth cards came out together.

It didn\u2019t come as a surprise, as she had been struggling with the aftermath of a previous one, but it was still an awful experience. When she arrived at the hospital, there was nothing anybody could do other than let nature take its course. They made her comfortable and told the family that she had a couple days before she passed. She was unresponsive and in a vegetative state. It was awful. It crushed me, and the rest of the family, because she loved her grandkids more than anything.\n\nI couldn\u2019t be there for her when she going to pass away. Unfortunately due to the tempo of my job, it was impossible to fly out to be with her one last time. However, as the week went by, she was still breathing by herself, albeit losing weird rapidly and clinging onto her life. Then comes 6 days after she was brought to the hospital, 3 times longer than the doctors believed, she was still alive.\n\nThe second I got the opportunity, I flew to visit her and be with the rest of my family. Everybody else already had their time with her except me. I arrived at the hospital and stayed with her and a few other members of the family. However, it was approaching 1 or 2 in the morning and we decided it would be best if we got some rest. We would leave one family member to be with her as throughout the whole ordeal, nobody left her side.\n\nAs we were getting our coats, I went up to her and said goodbye. I have her a kiss on the cheek and turned my back. It was at that moment that she let go and began to take her final breaths. \n\nIt was a hard few minutes after that but it made me reflect on my beliefs. I\u2019ve never been spiritual, I\u2019ve never thought that anybody had the slightest control about when their time was coming. I didn\u2019t think it was possible, until that night. Everyone was in disbelief as she had seemingly waited until the last family member had come to say their goodbyes. \n\nHowever, sometimes I still think it was a crazy coincidence. I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t know why I posted here. I guess I just wanted to put this experience in writing but I\u2019d also like to hear some sort of reassurance that she was listening and holding on until I got there. \n\nWhat do you think?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 65756, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My grandmother died, after hanging onto her life for a week in the hospital, moments after I said goodbye", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572760820, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dqgc8p/my_grandmother_died_after_hanging_onto_her_life/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "PopularTradition", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2q135vi1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572673483, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dqg7v7/older_women_45_love_me_but/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dqg7v7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 16, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dqg7v7/older_women_45_love_me_but/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572673483, "score": 5, "selftext": "....younger women either don\u2019t listen, try to compete or have an aversion towards me. \n\nI\u2019m a (27) year old man. Over 6 foot. Athletic build. College educated. Good sense of humor. Well dressed and groomed. \n\nIt\u2019s downright odd. An older woman would talk my ear off (perhaps a form of energy vamping?) and tell me their life story on the first go. Or I could approach them directly (you\u2019re gorgeous) with positive reception. But young women won\u2019t give me the time of day. I have to work significantly harder. And at the end of the day I get played in some fashion. \n\nI have narcissistic parents with a controlling mother (I worked hard to break that enmeshment) and passive father dynamic. \n\nMy guess is that I still have a lot of female codependencies in my subconscious that these older women see and are attracted to (perhaps I remind them of their son, someone they can control, someone who will listen to them too much, someone who was trained to be a good host by energy vampires, perhaps my mom placed a curse on me for leaving home to grow up/find myself, etc.) \n\nWith the older women it always morphs into me listening to them unless I look away to show disinterest then they reel me in with a question about myself then proceed to talk about themselves (eerily close to what my nparents do to get narcissistic supply form my light). \n\nBut younger women find this to be a turn off for some reason. Or maybe I am experiencing so much grief (yin energy) that I don\u2019t have enough masculine yang energy. \n\nI read the Law of Attraction at 15, but there is a nuance not mentioned.

And most prefer to spiritually bypass. \n\nCurious to hear what others have to say.

There is unseen danger to the indigenous people of California to up all the way to West coast up through Oregon and Canada. Do to uneducated members of the ongoing revival of goddess worship. Which has a direct correspondent to the environment. Which is the over harvest of wild white sage. And although the dangers of overharvesting especially of a wild indigenous plant is clear to the native people of that area.\nThe overharvest station has brought up the miseducation problem with in today's society when it comes to misappropriation of racist terms. I'm referring to the practice known as smudging. In ancient society there was no such thing although later on colonists in America used it as a way to degrade indigenous people to the Americans (North and South) as a way to describe their body paint made from ashes of animal products. They described it as a primal way to deter predators from their hunting. In reality Ash and other leftover materials from burned animal products were used as makeup. As well as smashing of berries and other plants that were mixed into the formula. \n\nSurprisingly this is a now term for burning white sage it attempts you clear the negative energy from one's home. Used as a misinformed practice to remove negative parasites and psychic negative energy. So how did this practice come to be from the racist term to a new age practice. \n\nIn fact it was just a misunderstanding of science used by the indigenous people. White sage has a low form of toxins that humans are unaffected by at least by ingesting it. That was used in boiling water to be cleared by parasites that would harm their intestines and kill them later on. The practice was known as purifying the water and the food by cooking it with in the liquid on the fire. \n\nLater on unfortunately due to miscommunication in the new age society the two current terms were combined and the practice was formed. \nit was also caught on due to the toxins being released in the air causing a high feeling. In which people are discovering now has an addicting effect. It can be known as a fuzzy or tingling feeling within the skin as well as a light headed reaction within the body causing a slight high. With this addicting effect upon the new age society white sage bundles dried to be burned flourished to every corner of the new age market. Addicting effects are so great that overharvesting and close to Extinction has been confirmed. Luckily with help of the indigenous people of the West coast white stage has been illegalized to pick and sell. Does some do not take this misappropriation seriously due to the addicting nature of this product. And although very offencive to the indigenous people the term smudging does remained for this practice. \n\nSo what can we do. Well simply not buying the product and being well-informed of the ongoing racism being spread within the new a society and pagan society as well is more than enough. Where there is a supply there will always be a demand within this product. And unfortunately even within that $200 fine for illegally selling white sage. The government does not care enough for the indigenous sacred practices of purifying their water and food to really establish a hold on the situation.

Now, being on the other side of those dark times, I see that what I was yearning for the whole time was for my existential search to be validated. I was sure there was something enormously significant about existence, but because everyone around me prioritized their social lives over this search for Truth I felt desperately alienated. \n\nNow that I've discovered a community of others, historical and present, engaging in this endeavor, I finally feel validated and wish to commit myself to it fully. I don't see any other point to this life than to explore it before it's gone again. Recently I've begun meditation, which has only shown me how far I have to go. I still use the internet to cope with quietness, I still react aggressively towards my family members' supposed \"shortcomings\", and I still get deeply uncomfortable when I sense I am coming face-to-face with the Truth. That's just to mention a few of the many ways my mind is in control at the moment. \n\nI'm only 19, so on one hand I feel like I should allow myself to \"just be a kid\", to watch Netflix instead of being productive/creative and only meditate when I want to.

Since that post I\u2019ve been seeing around 3-5 synchronicity Number\u2019s every single day which is very Interesting and I\u2019ve been also seeing more animals even dead ones which is kinda creepy. \n\nAnyways I just woke up from my nap and I\u2019m convinced the spirits or angels are actually trying to talk to me in there realm or want to have a conversion with me. So in my dream I was in this bright light place I was in third person view and I see this bright light room surrounded by water this angle came from the depths of the water with a pope outfit on and a staff covered in Jewels. The angle face looked like the gods shiva face but this isn\u2019t wasn\u2019t blue in color more of all white including the outfit. When I looked at this entity I couldn\u2019t speak to it, it didn\u2019t speak to me but I felt it\u2019s presence looking at me. Without the spirt really looking at me. I thank felt my body in the spirt work kinda of healing itself and I was stuck between the dream world and the physical world at this point. I think slowly woke up in the psychical world where I felt my back sort of healing itself in a way very very strange ( I\u2019ve been having back pain for the last year on and off) \n\n\nI have a theory the entities are trying to get in contact with me because I\u2019m still figuring out what I want to do with my life. I had a traumatic experience a year ago leaving me a hypochondriac, I finished two years of college got my degree when I was at my worst and I\u2019m now kinda of at a stopping point in my life. Since then I\u2019ve been working three part time jobs and getting help with my mental issues along the way. I think the angles are trying to tell me it\u2019s okay and to start thinking about what you want to do as a future plan for a career which I\u2019m starting to look into colleges and or think about my other options. \n\n\nIt\u2019s just really interesting having animals, Synchronicity\u2019s, and even dream of these angles or entities in the spirt and psychical world cross my path. And trying to connect with me in a way.

But still from time to time it had to come out. It was/is a mix of fear and rage, the desire to dominate and control everything, and also sometimes the desire to inflict pain for my satisfaction. I repressed this throughout my whole life ( im in my 20s now), but it found expression through violent, very violent porn viewing (which i feel now only increased this urge), hurting my dog and the like, i mean fucked up shit(i never broke the law tho). \n\nafterwards when this violent urge was satisfied i always regretted doing whatever i did.I started meditation and yoga and alot of the fear/rage got eliminated, i developed more empathy ( which i was severly lacking) and let love in. and i can say now in my experience this is the result/cause of a root, sacral and heart blockage, out of those the root blockage is most strong, i always feel a contraction/pressure there(perineum). It feels like if i relax this tension(which i cant consciously do) ill completely lose control of my body(this happened once) with some laughinggas and pranayama breathing, wow it felt like a volcano exploded and i started lashing out throwing myself on the ground, wildly thrashing out with my arms and whole body, it felt like something else controlled my body forcing me to release all this fear/tension. It felt like finally letting go of control, i mean wow better than any orgasm. \n\nThere is still alot of repressed stuff there tho, actually more of it entered my consciousness and now im in this weird place where i feel love and compassion most of the time and then suddenly some sadistic urge hits me, this also gets represented in my dreams. My biggest shame in my life is getting aroused by women getting treated badly sadistic stuff, a result of all the messed up porn i watched i guess. in my dreams this escalates to extremely fucked up visions and i get turned on by that even tho i dont want to. I just hope you guys have some insights and advice for how i should approach this situation and resolve this.\n\nYeah i never told anyone that and i hope big brother wont safe this post haha.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 65649, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "dark violent intrusive thoughts and urges", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572709285, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dq5xtz/dark_violent_intrusive_thoughts_and_urges/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "usernamealrdytakn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kaud2l2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572614557, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dq45zm/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1878/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dq45zm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dq45zm/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1878/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572614558, "score": 1, "selftext": "**TRANSLATION**\n\n**Wherever there is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 began with an inquiry of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. He was hopeful of the victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, Dro\u1e47a and Kar\u1e47a. He was hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But, after describing the scene in the battlefield, Sa\u00f1jaya told the King, \"You are thinking of victory, but my opinion is that where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna are present, there will be all good fortune.\" He directly confirmed that Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra could not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was there. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's acceptance of the post of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition of another opulence. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of them. There are many instances of such renunciation, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also the master of renunciation.\n\nThe fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Arjuna was fighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna were on the side of Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira's victory was certain. The battle was to decide who would rule the world, and Sa\u00f1jaya predicted that the power would be transferred to Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. It is also predicted here that Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, after gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because he was not only righteous and pious, but he was a strict moralist. He never spoke a lie during his life.\n\nThere are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to be a discussion of topics between two friends in a battlefield. But such a book cannot be scripture. Some may protest that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a incited Arjuna to fight, which is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction of morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: manman\u0101 bhava mad-bhakta\u1e25. One must become a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the essence of all religion is to surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as stated, Sarva-dharm\u0101n. The instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality. All other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last instruction of the G\u012bt\u0101 is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.\n\nFrom Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of knowledge in as far as the rituals of religion are confidential, but one is still involved with meditation and cultivation of knowledge. Surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the most confidential instruction and is the essence of the Eighteenth Chapter.\n\nAnother feature of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is that the actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Absolute Truth is realized in three features-impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are manifested and are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy. This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.\n\nIn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and all kinds of activities. All of these are dependant on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth, namely, impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, or any other transcendental conception, exist within the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the Supreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya's philosophy is that of \"inconceivably one and different.\" This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.\n\nThe living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. The conditioned living entity, however, is the marginal energy of the Lord; he tends to be in contact with both the material energy and the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighteenth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of its Conclusions-the Perfection of Renunciation.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the five principal subject matters that have been discussed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 ?**\n\n**Question 2 : What are the three principal realizations of the Absolute Truth ? Which one of them is the most perfect ?**\n\n[Picture : Bhagavad-gita 18.78](https://gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/78)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 65629, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 18.78", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572700946, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dq45zm/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1878/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "MADAFAKA9292", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_46t54wk1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572607724, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dq2xte/purple_auras/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dq2xte", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dq2xte/purple_auras/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572607725, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello everyone, I used to see purple auras around certain people when I was little, sometimes even around plants, I was wondering if anyone knows why and what it means, and why I can\u2019t see it anymore? \n\nI believe in spirits and a world beyond ours.

We possess a human nature. This is the impermanent, temporary, or trapped in time part of us. This part of us we know all too well.\n\n  We are also Beings.

This is the part of you that is forever. \n\n  We each have our own unique point of view when it comes to our life experience. Somethings do not change. Like the fact that we were all born, and we must all die. Life and death are only two words we use to describe our experiences, but the meaning of either word can change according to how you chose to view your experience here on Earth.  I believe we have flip-flopped the words somewhere along the way and that what we are experiencing now is in fact death. We are all **living** the process of **death**. Learning how to die. Buuuuuuuuuuuut.....\n\n  Why fear death if you will never experience it? You've either been alive forever or you've technically been dead before. The Being that you are ONLY knows life. The Being that you are has never known death. Death is an illusion. Ask yourself, \"*Have I ever* not *been alive?\"* *\"What was it like?\"* \n\n   This is why it's so easy to live like we will never die when we're younger. 'Cause it really feels like that.

genuine people should be more like you, the world would be such a better place\" yeah well I've heard it a lot and I just realized that it's dumb because people say this stuff but never commit to it themselves, people say a lot of words that's what people are good at speaking a load of nonsense but never do you see them living up to their own words, people speak and speak and speak of concepts that would help the world but they will never live up to their own ideas, I hate that so much, it's like don't speak if you ain't doing it yourself, it more people were like me it would start with you but you won't change into a better person, it's like yeah if everyone who's ever said that decided to live up to those words then the world would have been eliminated of evil and jerks, the thing is is that theirs a lot more good and genuine people then the media portrays, I meet them everyday, the thing is that I Live in a place where most people are on there own and people are more genuine mostly cuz I live in a place where politics and corruption isn't really the way of life, I live in a quiet state and most people are genuine and caring, but I still believe that if someone's going to say something they should lead by example, if I am kind enough for you to say that then you should change into the same type of Character and lead by those words, if someone who is 800 pounds came up to me and said I'm a fitness instructor I would laugh and say yeah right, if a man in rags told me he was rich I would laugh, if someone told me they were genuine but hurt me with lies I would laugh, the thing is people can say things but never live up to it, dont try to say that more people should be like me no it should start with you, seeing me be so nice should inspire you to do the same, I hear it so often that I know that it's a collection of different types of people bad and good, and its nice to meet an actual genuine person who stands up to that saying but it's disappointing to hear others who won't do the same live up to it, but I still go about life willing to help others who need it, the thing is is that I don't want to be recognized for being a good person on a massive scale how I want it to be is anyone I come in contact with I want it to be like a personal thing like this person needs a ride and I give it to them and their like thank you your so kind, I like doing little things for everyone, because I hope it inspires someone to be a better person, but I don't want to be famous for it, I don't want my name in the paper or else it would ruin my little organization that I've sorta always had which is like be nice in the shadows sorta thing, I would like if all my light workers out there thought of helping people as a little organization that millions are doing in the shadows, helping people but not doing something to extreme that it draws a bunch of attention towards you, that's how I want it to be, I don't want everyone to know my name but I want to be that \"rare\" individual who spreads a bit of love each day to others, today I just did something small for my teacher I asked if she wanted help picking things up and she seemed a little shocked for a moment and had to process it and was like ok my seniors don't ever do that so I appreciate the kind gesture, it was honestly a good feeling, it should be small but significant, I like the idea that there's a bunch of light ninjas out there spreading joy and kindness and they just sorta spread it throughout the entire empire, we should all work together, I do hope someday I could bring all the light workers together in one place and then just scatter and start helping a whole bunch of people like imagine a sea of light fighting a whole bunch of darkness that's sorta how I Invision it, it would be like this major event, instead of protests we instead open the doors for people, help with the groceries, pay money to the poor and donate but all in one mass group all at one time, it would be crazy but cool but then it wouldn't be secret but it would still help raise the vibrations a lot, maybe someday there will be an actual event like this.", "send_replies": true,

I had looked at it a few times before, but this time it was different. The external perception had not changed much, except that the colors seemed brighter and more vibrant. But there was now an added dimension to it. This is hard to explain. I don't know how, but I was aware of something invisible that I felt was the essence of that tree, its inner spirit, if you like. And somehow I was part of that. I realize. now that I hadn't truly seen the tree before, just a flat and dead image of it.\n\nMy question in this post is about how that present moment experience changes. If I get to the present moment, just experiencing perception, without thought, I don't always experience the same things and scenes in the same way. In the tree example quoted, the kind of essence or energy I feel associated with my perception of the tree changes. Sometimes I feel a higher sort of energy, involving a more complex and more pleasant appreciation. Maybe I could say it also involves more love.\n\nAs far as I can tell this isn't simply due to thoughts. Or, at least, it's not due to anything like the sort of inner monologue thought which is happening a lot at other times. \n\nWhen present moment experience is especially good, it reminds me of how I felt during early childhood in Croatia, before a traumatic back and forth move to Canada screwed that up. I see things around me here, like distant lights on the other side of a lake, with feelings which remind me of seeing other things in my childhood, like distant lights accross the sea in Croatia. \n\nIn general what brings up the best present moment experience nowadays is having a wholesome and reasonably productive and successful day. So, even though it's present moment experience it seems somewhat connected with \"I\". But it seems to be linked with productiveness in a broader context, including doing nice things for others, and not only about doing stuff for myself. A narrow escapist kind of focus, like doing well in a computer game,  almost never brought on a very impressive improvement in present moment experience. Some drugs can bring up more of an improvement in present moment experience than escapist activities, but even that isn't very impressive compared to a good wholesome day sober. \n\nOne way of explaining this is that it's like playing the same music in different ways. A less impressive present moment experience would be like playing a simple MIDI file, and using some simple synthesis method like FM synthesis, playing a very low bitrate MP3, or experiencing the music performed using very few instruments. An impressive present moment experience is experiencing that same music via a high quality orchestra performance. \n\nA long time ago I came to the conclusion that some aspects of my own well-being, which could maybe be called my own mood or emotional state, somehow affect present moment experience. Is this what's going on?\n\nBTW Another question relates to the sense of oneness people report in association with present moment experiences. I definitely experience less of a sense of separation from others when I'm in the present moment more. But, I wouldn't really call it oneness, because it seems more like having less walls.

It was exhibited to Arjuna only, yet some great devotees could also see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when it was shown to Arjuna, and Vy\u0101sa was one of them.

My grand mom for around 4 years and my grand pop for around 8. \n\nI was trying to go to sleep last night and I started balling my eyes out about them. Luckily my grand pop didn\u2019t suffer too long, although I\u2019m sure it was painful when he was sick( stage four lung cancer.) It wasn\u2019t caught early enough. \nMy grandma developed dementia and had to endure it for for years after he passed. Everyday she would ask for her \u201c Franny \u201c which is what she called my grand pop ( Frank. ) she didn\u2019t remember anyone except him everyday, which I think was a soulmate situation. \n\nIt was disturbing and traumatizing to see her develop a 6 inch hole in her right side, not from lack of care. Most of my family and a few nurses plus a doctor would be there w/ her everyday.\n I think it was a bed sore and no medicine was helping either. \nThe smell alone and the look in her face as the doctor dressed her wounds and packed the hole w/ clean gauze everyday was terrible for us, no doubt. But it was new for her everyday bc she couldn\u2019t remember who any of us were...let alone a random doctor. There\u2019s plenty of other things she did/said that were heartbreaking and also a little disturbing. Having seen her go through that for four years was haunting. It still is, but I cope pretty well. It\u2019s expected that someone would break down every now and then about it it. \n\nThere was extreme sadness when she died, but major relief. I can\u2019t imagine having a bunch of people you don\u2019t remember taking care of you, changing you, bathing you and feeding you at the age of 70 something. Thankfully, she passed in her sleep. The next morning we rushed over and said goodbye. She died w/ one eye open and that was also disturbing. \nThat\u2019s a short rundown. Yes, short. I could be here all day if I spoke about it all. I just want to describe why it broke me. \n\nSo when I was breaking down out of nowhere lastnight I tried to mediate and breathe through it. During that time I felt the presence of both of my grandparents. I heard them tell me it\u2019s was okay and pretty much that I shouldn\u2019t carry the burden of that w/ me, and I felt  as if someone was rubbing my arm. It wasn\u2019t creepy. I felt warmth and a lot of happiness. I closed my eyes and it was as if a light was glowing when I closed them. They told me they loved me and I told them I love them both. Today when I woke up I got a message again. They told me I don\u2019t have to hold one to what happened and to let it go. This was all mental, I didn\u2019t vocally speak to them except for telling them that I love them after they told me they loved me. \n\nAlso I\u2019ve been trying to figure out what tattoo I should get and I picked  one out of the 25 ideas I have, but something about last night gave me the idea of something angelic instead. I\u2019m not religious, but you don\u2019t need to be religious to believe in angels. I\u2019m not saying my grandparents are angels, but I know they believed in them as well. It just reminds me of the sweet people they were. They\u2019re guardians for sure. \n\nIs it odd to anyone that this happened the day before Samhain?

Background: Dont know what I'm doing with my life and am mildly to moderately depressed.\n     So around a month ago I actually experienced this \"hell\" in which our reality is overlaid. I was actually geeking out on a dab, and man, did this experience make me appreciate sobriety. So I was with two high school buddies that I haven't hung out with in a minute and my good girl friend whom I've been friends with a few years. Subnote, last time I took a dab I took two tabs of acid, more than a year before this experience and I haven't done either again until then. So I smoke down the dab and can slowly feel \"reality\" slipping and start seeing life for what it really is. \nMy thoughts and actions in that moment:\n-Check the time on my phone and wonder about work. Repeat. Reach for my juul that is a nasty addiction and is probably killing me. Repeat. Look over at my girl friend and wonder why we haven't fucked yet. Probably because we're both too shy and insecure to make the first move. Essentially she is me in this situation and vice versa. Our lives are all some sort of cycle.- \nI realized that life is some sort of lesson. Life will throw situations and paths your way and it's up to you to decide what to do. Life knows what its throwing at you and nothing comes by coincidence. And, ultimately, you will face the consequences. We're all living this reality, and I think that we're all the same being, separated by time and body. In that aspect, the only thing that makes sense in this life is to help ourselves and help each other along the way.\nThings got really bad in the car and I blacked out completely and my subconscious mind took over. Crazy shit but I think I've posted enough. \nThoughts, comments, similar experiences and beliefs? \u2661", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 65205, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "We've all been roped into this hell we call life", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572486926, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dp06sb/weve_all_been_roped_into_this_hell_we_call_life/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "goghgurt", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8sh2n0c", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572399505, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dozz45/does_anyone_know_if_an_iud_can_cause_sacral/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dozz45", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General"}], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dozz45/does_anyone_know_if_an_iud_can_cause_sacral/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572399506, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 65202, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Does anyone know if an IUD can cause Sacral Chakra blockages?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572485895, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dozz45/does_anyone_know_if_an_iud_can_cause_sacral/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "HappySoulHungryMind", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3hlqdcpe", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572392084, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/doyczd/spirituality_does_not_discriminate/", "gildings": {}, "id": "doyczd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/doyczd/spirituality_does_not_discriminate/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572392188, "score": 12, "selftext": "Religion discriminates.  \nSpirituality does not discriminate.

Respond don\u2019t React\n\nSay you\u2019re in a good mood, minding your own business. You\u2019re watching your fav youtube channel, and then out of no where your significant other, let\u2019s call him Bob, storms into the room, starts yelling about how enormous the electricity bill is this month. Then he starts blaming it on you, because you like to keep your heater on. And he starts calling you names..like stupid and careless\n\nWhen this happens, what emotions are you feeling? You\u2019re probably feeling a variety of emotions. Angry that Bob stormed in and yelled, confused as to why the bill is so high, guilty because you think you may be the culprit of the high electricity bill, and mostly hurt because Bob is being disrespectful.\n\nAnd you\u2019ve got a couple of choices on how to address this situation:\n\n\u2022 1. You can choose to react negatively which means you change your good mood and take on the negativity, which now puts YOU in a BAD mood and then you fight back and start yelling at Bob and calling him names. OR\n\n\u2022 2. You can choose to respond positively. Which means that you don\u2019t engage with his negative actions. Instead you calmly say \u201cI understand that you may be feeling frustrated right now, Bob. However, I don\u2019t want to talk to you when you\u2019re yelling at me and calling me names. I find it completely disrespectful. So, I\u2019m going to leave the room and when you\u2019re a bit more calm, then I\u2019ll be more than happy to talk with you.\n\nSee the difference. When we choose to react, we take on whatever emotion the other person is feeling and we wear it. Our good mood gets ruined and we immediately go into a negative headspace.\n\nBut when we respond, we\u2019re not going to take on negative emotions. We\u2019re not going to allow ourselves to get pushed down to the other person\u2019s level. We take control of the situation and distance ourselves from it, so it doesn\u2019t affect us at all. When we do this, we TEACH the other person that we don\u2019t accept that kind of behavior towards us.\n\nI like to look at this situation the same as if you were dealing with a toddler throwing a tantrum. Because essentially this is what the other person is doing--acting like a toddler. And If a toddler yelled and screamed at you, you wouldn\u2019t yell and scream back, right? You would calmly explain what is an acceptable way to talk to you. You don\u2019t yell back at them and call them names, because you\u2019ve got to role model and SHOW THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS what is acceptable behavior. That\u2019s how they learn. Right?\n\nThe exact same principle applies to adults. Whenever we run into someone who is acting disrespectful towards us, we respond by staying calm and in control of our words and actions, instead of reacting negatively by mimicking the other person\u2019s rude behavior.\n\nThe next way we teach people how to treat us is to:\n\n2. Enforce Boundaries\n\nSay you\u2019ve had one of the most stressful work days of your life and you have a coworker who invites you out to dinner. But you are EXHAUSTED and all you can think about is wrapping yourself in a blanket, grabbing your fav snack, and vegging out to your fav Netflix show.\n\nSo you\u2019ve got two choices to make when this kind of situation happens: You say yes to your coworker and spend the rest of the evening probably regretting your decision.\n\nOr you can set a boundary and communicate your wants and needs. A boundary is basically understanding what is best for you -emotionally, physically, and mentally. So, in this example, what you may feel is best is to say \u201cno\u201d because you want to rest. So as a response to our coworker we can say \u201cThanks so much for the invite. I won\u2019t be able to make it tonight but I hope you have fun.\u201d\n\nNow, if we say yes, even if we don\u2019t want to go\u2026we may be the type of person who says yes to everything, regardless of what it is, because we don\u2019t want to disappoint anyone or we don\u2019t want to be seen as the boring person. The problem with this is that we become the \u201cyes person.\u201d People start to know us as the \u201cyes\u201d person, so they think they can ask us to do anything, because we will ALWAYS agree\u2026 Why do they do that? Because we\u2019ve unintentionally taught people that\u2019s what we do. If we never stand up for ourselves. If we never say no, then people learn\u2026 \u201coh ok, she says yes to everything, so if I ask anything of her, I know she\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nNow, if we have the courage to say no, then sometimes we have someone who doesn\u2019t respect our boundaries and tries to push us to do something anyway. And usually there\u2019s some flattery or guilt thrown in like\u2026\n\n\u201cplease it won\u2019t be the same without you!\u201d or...\u201djust this one time\u2026you hardly ever go out\u201d or \u201cyou don\u2019t want to leave me hanging do you\u201d Do these responses sound familiar to you? It\u2019s hard to say no when we get these sort of responses, right?\n\nBut if we change our response from no to yes\u2026then without even realizing, we teach people that they can push our boundaries if they want a certain response from us.\n\nAgain, this situation reminds me of communicating with a child. If a child asks for a piece of chocolate and you tell them they can\u2019t have any\u2026then they may throw a tantrum, or use flattery or try to guilt you by saying \u201cyou never let us have chocolate\u201d or \u201cpleaseee I\u2019ve been so good today\u201d you\u2019re the best mom in the whole world\u201d\n\nIf you give in and say yes, then that teaches the child that they can push your boundary to get what they want when you say no.\n\nSo, whenever we say no, it needs to be firm. Whenever we enforce any kind of boundary, we need to be firm with it.\n\nWhen we do this, we teach people that we respect ourselves and they should do the same.\n\nThe next way we teach people how we want to be treated is by:\n\n3. Communicate Your Feelings\n\nSay you have a family member who always picks on you about your career. In so many words, they tell you that your job isn\u2019t good enough and that you need to make more money. When they do this, it can make you feel angry, upset, or frustrated, because it makes you feel as if you\u2019re not good enough even though you LOVE your job.\n\nWhen this kind of situation arises, whenever a family member picks on you about something, usually two things happen, o You give the silent treatment and avoid this family member like the plague or o You just take it. You sit there. say nothing. and maybe even kinda laugh it off a bit\n\nBut when you do those two things, it\u2019s not addressing the issue that is at hand which is: when that family member says unkind words to you, it makes you feel worthless. And because you\u2019re not communicating with that family member, you\u2019re essentially showing them that it\u2019s ok to say those things.\n\nSo, what we should do instead is communicate our wants and needs with that family member. We should tell them how we feel when they say something that offends us and that we would appreciate it if they stopped.\n\nNow some family members are completely oblivious when they say hurtful things to us.

Any advice or guidance greatly appreciated. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor the past few weeks I have been extremely tired. I haven\u2019t been able to sleep well (takes awhile to fall asleep/wake up numerous times in the middle of the night - usually between 3 and 5am). \n\nI feel like my body is fighting off a cold /flu-like symptoms. My throat is sore. I went to buy a few crystals the other day and the lady asked me randomly if my throat has been bothering me and offered me sodalite. \n\nMy dreams are super vivid. The other night I woke up and my body was running very hot. \n\nI see 222, 333, 444, 555 and 1111 A LOT. Once in a blue I\u2019ll see 777 and 888. \n\nMy headaches and migraines are happening 2-3x/week. \n\nI\u2019m incredibly emotional. Very depressed, to extreme anxiety to being overfilled with happiness to the point I\u2019m crying (don\u2019t show me animal or baby videos bc you\u2019d think I just finished chopping onions). Anxiety attacks are happening maybe once a week. My chest is tight and I find it hard to breathe randomly. Someone actually told me the other day to breathe. I feel like I\u2019m constantly on the verge of tears. \n\nMy body is sore and I\u2019m at the highest weight I\u2019ve ever been in my life. My eating habits are all over the place. No appetite to must eat everything. Super healthy to sweets and carbs. \n\nI feel like I can\u2019t focus or concentrate. I just wanna be home. \n\nEverything is TOO BRIGHT and I\u2019m constantly adjusting the volume of something. \n\nI understand that this may be necessary for me to grow and evolve but it\u2019s kinda scary bc I feel like I don\u2019t have control (Sun in Capricorn, Moon in Virgo &amp; Ascending in Libra). \n\nI started reading/practicing tarot and it\u2019s been so spot on. I did a reading for my best friend and she started crying!\n\nAlso, this past Full Moon I did a release &amp; manifestation ritual. Before I started, a fox (I\u2019ve never seen one in person) crossed my path and after I saw a deer. Been seeing a lot of spiders (I used to be so afraid of them and now they don\u2019t even bother me) and a few ladybugs. \n\nI say all this to: \n1. Get it off my chest. \n2. Anyone else going thru an energy shift?\n3. People that are experiencing/have experienced - what\u2019s helping/helped you get thru this process?\n\nThanks in advance.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 65145, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Experiencing An Energy Shift", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572467438, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dovq5p/experiencing_an_energy_shift/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "quwandawms01", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1anmylfd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572372738, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dotpsv/i_meditate_but_something_is_still_missing/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dotpsv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Spirit Guide"}], "link_flair_template_id": "6b76e192-ceef-11e9-820e-0e9c6e8dde10", "link_flair_text": "Spirit Guide", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dotpsv/i_meditate_but_something_is_still_missing/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572372740, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hi guys!

This means that one has to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not directly but through the medium of the spiritual master. The spiritual master is the transparent medium, although it is true that the experience is direct. This is the mystery of the disciplic succession. When the spiritual master is bona fide, then one can hear Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 directly, as Arjuna heard it. There are many mystics and yog\u012bs all over the world, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of all yoga systems. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's instruction is explicitly stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101-surrender unto Kr\u1e63\u1e47a. One who does so is the topmost yog\u012b. This is confirmed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter. Yogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101m.\n\nN\u0101rada is the direct disciple of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the spiritual master of Vy\u0101sa. Therefore Vy\u0101sa is as bona fide as Arjuna because he comes in the disciplic succession, and Sa\u00f1jaya is the direct disciple of Vy\u0101sa. Therefore by the grace of Vy\u0101sa, his senses were purified, and he could see and hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly. One who directly hears K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can understand this confidential knowledge. If one does not come to the disciplic succession, he cannot hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore his knowledge is always imperfect, at least as far as understanding Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is concerned.\n\nIn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, all the yoga systems, karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and bhakti-yoga, are explained. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of all such mysticism. It is to be understood, however, that as Arjuna was fortunate enough to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly, similarly, by the grace of Vy\u0101sa, Sa\u00f1jaya was also able to hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly. Actually there is no difference in hearing directly from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or hearing directly from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a via a bona fide spiritual master like Vy\u0101sa. The spiritual master is the representative of Vy\u0101sadeva also. According to the Vedic system, on the birthday of the spiritual master, the disciples conduct the ceremony called Vy\u0101sa-p\u016bj\u0101.\n\n**Question 1 : Who was the spiritual master of Sa\u00f1jaya ? How one can directly hear the Bhagavad gita as Arjuna heard from Krishna ?** \n\n[Picture : Bhagavad-gita 18.75](https://gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/75)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 65094, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 18.75", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572434739, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/doog72/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1875/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "autresliuex", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1jqpn81h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572348173, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/doof73/spiritual_awakening_dietary_changes/", "gildings": {}, "id": "doof73", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/doof73/spiritual_awakening_dietary_changes/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572348175, "score": 2, "selftext": "I am not here for a vegan/vegetarian/non argument, so please avoid all of that on Earthly levels of discussion.

This makes nearly zero sense to me as I\u2019m also anaemic and have been advised throughout life by medical professionals to keep a high red meat intake. \n\nI would love to hear from someone who has a real answer to this, reasoning, or similar experience.

I grew up Catholic and started to reject God and literally became a Satanist and did a ritual that basically sold my soul. I then became an atheist and thought nothing of it, but I've recently learned about obsession and all the symptoms of it I've experienced. I had obsessive thoughts of cutting, throwing up (bulimia) and suicide after I fell from grace and I finally \"woke up\" recently. I now believe these thoughts happened 1. From trauma and 2. Because a dark entity attached itself to me and has never left. I feel like meditation and prayer aren't enough to break the bond this/these spirits have on me\n\nI guess I'm asking for advice or if there's any mediums that can help me rid myself of these spirits that influenced me to multilate myself? I feel like being obsessed will lead me to not be able to fully ascend. I've also been having really vivid, weird dreams since my ritual and that's a sign of spiritual obsession.

The way to destroy is through our most precious resource. We protect tangible items such as our cars, homes, bank accounts, etc.; yet we do little to protect the souls of our children. We like to think that many of our youth are going through phases which they will outgrow. Boys will be boys; that girl in just fast.\n\nVery disturbing are the news reports of the actions of our youth.  Evident in this is the apparent lack of respect for the human life.  More and more children are being charged with murder of other serious crimes. The persons locked away in prisons didn\u2019t come into this world as adults. Each person is someone\u2019s child, born with the prospect for living a God fearing and just life. How we nurture that potential directly influences the choices our children make in life. The things we as parents place value on are the same things that help our children determine their self worth or lack thereof.\n\nWe question why our children have lost their way.  Why there is rampant disrespect for elders, people in authority and even the Church itself. Our children are being raised without a healthy fear of authority and even worse-without the fear of God. We live in a world where, for many, God is no longer the center of our Universe. We question why such turmoil exists in the world. We point fingers at the government, neighbors and schools. We point fingers at celebrities who we claim have so much influence on our children\u2019s thought process.\n\nWe don\u2019t teach our kids about God. We don\u2019t take them to church. We think it is robbery to have our children subjected to prayers. It is an affront to some when reference is made to God on money or in government. We turn right around and cry out for this same God in the midst of our despair.\n\nI am reminded of the children of Israel. When will we learn? When will we acknowledge that the same God who led the Israelites from bondage is the same God, who flooded the Earth? The same God, who gave us His only Son, is the same God who slayed the firstborn of the Egyptians. We cannot continue to dwell in this cavern of darkness and despair. These are desperate times. We must take back from the Devil that which he seeks to forever claim. \n\nThis stronghold must be broken. We must first start at the beginning.\n\nIn the beginning, there was God.\n\nHow could we allow ourselves to forget the most important foundation of our very being? God made us in His image. Because of this we are intelligent beyond our imagination. Sadly, we have fallen into the trap of outsmarting ourselves. We tamper with genetics. We attempt to recreate life in tubes. We discount the works of God with \u201cproven\u201d science. We attempt to debunk miracles. We even try to prove that God does not exist! How then can we wonder why our children are lost? We are all children of God, yet we are lost. Yes, even you who claim He does not exist. The blind cannot lead the blind.\n\nSome people have declared that they \u201cfound\u201d God or Jesus.  Neither God nor Jesus was ever lost. The Spirit of God travels beside you even during your hours of unbelief. He is in the very air you breathe. He is present in the rustling of trees. He is that little tickle at the nape of your neck. He is that voice that whispers \u201cDon\u2019t do that\u201d. He is patient. He fulfills all your needs. Someone wrote: God provides food for the birds, but He does not place it in their nests. The same applies to our faith in God. He is waiting, but we must seek to know Him.\n\nThis journey of New Beginnings upon which we are about to embark, there will be seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Once we begin down this path, we will awaken the sleeping giant. As long as we do nothing the Devil is content.  We will reclaim what is rightfully the Lord\u2019s.  We will take back our children, soul by soul. Many may not come willingly. Many will fight against that which is good. I believe that even though a person may live an ungodly life, the soul still recognizes its Creator.\n\nWhen God placed Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, He provided instruction in regards to which trees they could not eat of. Adam and Eve were given the opportunity to choose to obey God. He could simply have not placed those trees in the garden at all. God does not force His will upon us.\n\nWe must choose to follow the narrow road to God.  Just as a farmer toils in the heat in order to enjoy the fruits of his labor at harvest, so must we work to bring people to God so that we each can enjoy our stay in the House of many Mansions.\n\nWe must be about Our Father's Business.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5",

I may have seen the world through the eyes of someone who constantly felt kicked around by life, where even when I succeeded, it might have felt like I fought tooth and nail to achieve.\n\nInstead, I get to lean on a teaching that reminds me there\u2019s always more going on than I can see, that there is no circumstance no matter how hard, devastating or upsetting that can steal my peace unless I let it and once I remember these ideals I can begin to apply the tools that allow me to work my way back to who I have come here to be, instead of simply feeling, once again, punched by life.\n\nI find my life has grown into the magnificent state of being it is because I constantly work at reminding myself to use the spiritual tools I have and remember that being kind includes to myself, not just others.\n\nI encourage you to not let life\u2019s circumstances take over the powerful, creative spiritual being you are and remember the quote we have on our wall outside the sanctuary, \u201cTo abandon the Truth in our hour of need to not understand the Truth.\u201d\n\n**Practice for the week:** Whenever you\u2019re feeling upset, annoyed, angry, devastated or any other emotion that might pull you out of love and compassion, be kind to yourself, then others and use the spiritual tools that work for you.  If you don't have any that work, feel free to get in touch with me... I would be happy to share mine.\n\n**Affirmation for the week:** I am kind to myself and others.\n\nLove you;\n\nRev.

I believe that it is truly, genuinely innovative. I believe that it\u2019s well considered, well structured, and adaptable while being able to remain aligned with the core beliefs of the faith.\n\nI\u2019m not confident about adoption rates for the product.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that I will do everything I possibly can and the Church of Earth will fail to see the level of growth required to achieve these goals.\n\nAnd maybe the goals of the organization will be achieved in some other way? I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s what a lot of people think will happen. Hardly anyone has been dismissive of this because they oppose what I\u2019m trying to do. It\u2019s all about the method. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be a religion\u201d. I get that. I hear people.\n\nBut I don\u2019t see it that way. On a very personal level I believe this is a religion because I feel faith for the first time in my life. I wasn\u2019t lacking faith before. I didn\u2019t have it so there was nothing to lack. And that was totally OK. Now it\u2019s there and this is just a new thing I\u2019ve got going on, apparently.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m any better or worse. I\u2019ve just changed. But I can\u2019t easily explain this to people.\n\n \u201cI was really depressed about the future of our species and then I started thinking about ways to address that. Going through this process had a psychological impact on me. I have now formed a very specific world view around something that can\u2019t be proven which is massive in scale. If I see major progress on this for the rest of my life I will still not have proof that it will be successful. I have faith that it will be successful and that we will build an amazing world for future generations.\u201d\n\nThat makes sense to me but I understand why it doesn\u2019t make sense to other people.\n\nI need to convince a significant portion of the population of our species that following this faith will prove this faith, that it\u2019s outcome is beneficial to everyone, and that this isn\u2019t going to happen unless we all work towards it.\n\nHow does this happen as something other than a religion? I just don\u2019t see it. I\u2019ve looked so hard.\n\nWe all need to help each other. We all need to be passionate about improving ourselves. We all need to be aware of our impact on the world. We need to understand that we have evolved to compete and that we will destroy ourselves unless we change in a significant way.\n\nSome people need faith to believe we can achieve this. I am one of them. If you can get there without faith: that\u2019s great. If you can get there with another faith: that\u2019s great. If you need a faith to get you there and don\u2019t want one of the other ones: here you go.\n\nWe all need to work at improving a lot of things all over the world for a very long time. We can do this and in doing it we will make a better world for all of us.\n\nThis is a message that must be spoken at every level of our society. It must rise up and drown out calls for conflict and war. We need to stop being at war with each other and we need to stop being at war with our world. There are better ways to do everything we are doing. We need to do them.\nWe are trapped here and we are destroying ourselves. We can stop.\n\nOnce enough people believe this we will finally stop. It needs to be basically everyone. Get there however you need to get there.\n\nUnless you think that if I fail it doesn\u2019t matter.

So much so that I will not talk about that on reddit \")\n\nAs a child I liked the Beatles. Still do. Since the time I was a child I have discovered bands like The Flaming Lips and The Grateful Dead. I like a wide range of music from Talking Heads to Psychic TV to 13th Floor Elevators to some Mars Volta every now and then.\n\nI live a pretty idyllic life in Austin. I ride my bicycle. I spend time by myself. I talk to people who grew up here. It is a place that a lot of people seem to be moving to. At barton springs, we have an exhibit showing a prehistoric rock art map of the major springs along the Texas Hill Country region. I love swimming in that blue water. It is healing.\n\nI have dealt with depression. Always know somebody has it worse than you. My thing is that I can only work on myself and to work on other people is a futile thing at best, unless you are very much centered.

I believe in many things that the educated atheist would scoff at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy favorite book is \"Slaughterhouse Five\" . I also really enjoy \"Cats Cradle\" both by that one guy his name escapes me.

After a while of forcing myself to get out and go places when a relative visited me and my family from far away. I guess things started changing a bit. Not completely but slowly I was beginning to feel at least less miserable. I still felt like I was forcing myself but it was something. Now I dont get like this as often but it does happen maybe a couple times a week or so. And idk how to handle it very well. Sometimes I just feel like I dont want to do anything and it makes me crazy. Because it's not in the \"meh I wanna relax today\" type of way. Sometimes It's just an overwhelming fear. Others a loss of motivation type of way. Idk what causes it because I feel like there's nothing directly making me feel this way. But I do feel it. I always get scared of it getting worse and me not wanting to take care of myself it scares me. Please help me or give me your opinion. What would you do. Is this spiritual? Is this mood related?

Things started going downhill in 2015. My mother made a poor financial decision behind my dad\u2019s back that led to turmoil. They have been arguing ever since- yelling, screaming, slamming doors, throwing and breaking things, the whole show. Anyways, my Mom\u2019s mental health took a spiral and she is now depressed and has borderline personality disorder. If this is of any importance, her father passed away in Oct. 2015 and my Dad\u2019s mother passed Nov. 2015.\n\nJune 2015 I had my first panic attack out of the blue. I had another one in November of that year, one in 2016, one in 2017, one in 2018. I was very good at brushing it off after it happened. Back in July I had one and have been having them once or twice a month since then. I never had general anxiety but now every single day is a struggle. I don\u2019t leave the house besides going to work in the morning because I have a fear that I will have an episode while I\u2019m out- so in my mind if I just stay home it\u2019s better. I know it sounds silly. \n\nI was always bubbly, smiley, and social, even though family life was difficult. I don\u2019t feel like myself anymore it\u2019s like I\u2019m a different person. My favorite thing about myself was my strong mental health and my personality. I thanked God for it often. I\u2019m lost and it feels like my soul is completely shattered. \n\nI have been thinking for a while that maybe all of this misfortune is because of negative energy in the house or a bad entity. My Dad the other day mentioned to me that the feeling and vibe in the house lately has been uncomfortable, he is not spiritual although he is religious, so I was shocked to hear him say this. \n\nWhen I was little I was always in my parents room waking them up with breakfast in bed, laying with them, sleeping in their when I was sick. The past couple of years I don\u2019t sit in there often, it has a very eerie feeling and actually makes me disoriented and dizzy. \n\nI went to a well known medium with my Mom in July and he didn\u2019t mention anything bad. \n\nI tried posting this morning but for some reason it got deleted.

That does make sense though....\n\nIntelligent design didn\u2019t create humans, it created the human race, as a species. Humans must have been created from an original set. Not really a chicken or the egg story, but just created and fully functional. Now, we are all created of and by ourselves. Blank stock set out into the world with no connection to the original set of humans and no knowledge passed down from that time. The individual is irrelevant and purpose and meaning are meant to be discovered and understood on an individual basis. What the meaning of life is on a grand scale, is reproduction. It is our purpose to keep the human race alive as long as possible. No single person is more important than the whole. \n\nThe human itself is nothing more than a blank and empty stock created by other humans. The human race as a species though must have been created by something, for something. If we have a good purpose or a doomed future is unknown. Why we were created is unknown. What created us is unknown. \n\nThere must be some sort of a way for all humans, of any time period, without our any knowledge past on, to access or connect to the higher power that created this reality. Must be something a blank stock in this form is capable of understanding or connecting to on some level without any outside input. All organic to the self. And I think a basic understanding of \u201csomething did this for a good reason\u201d is about all we can do on our own. \n\nWhat is our purpose besides reproduction? Is there any?\n\n If humans were removed from Earth it would seem that the system would be self sufficient. We are not required for Earths balance to be maintained. It is easy for us to unbalance and ruin the planet but difficult to make improvements. \n\nWe are the only organisms we know of capable of choosing between loving kindness and death and destructions. We are the only creatures capable of having a large scaled effect on the universe. \n\nIt used to feel like the easy way out to believe in something while saying I cannot and will not ever understand it. But lately nihilism just seems too damned and I feel I\u2019ll end in suicide if I stay on this path. I have to try to believe in something else. \n\nI think I can truly get behind the idea that I am part of a greater whole, and an smart enough to be self aware, but lack the necessary capabilities to see more than three dimensions and understand the puzzle of the universe. \n\nMaybe this stage of life is the caterpillar to our butterfly.

There are eight compartments involved during the process of deliberately manifesting that influence the outcome according to the amount of energy that is put in each separate compartment. Each compartment, if focused on alone, will render results of some kind. However, to successfully manifest lucidly, you should apply all eight compartments simultaneously. \n\nAs you become more skilled, you will only need to enhance the compartments that need work and strengthening. The way to do this is by focusing on the compartments you don't want to remain in default-mode during your next deliberate-manifestation attempts. Keep in mind, as you read each compartment, that the default-mode definition is neutral. In other words, depending on where you are positioned in life will depend on whether the default-mode definition is one that describes your advantage or disadvantage.\n\nThe first three compartments, when combined, represents your beliefs about yourself, the world around you, and what you can achieve. As you work on the first three compartments, you will know yourself better concerning your interests and your awareness of the strengths in yourself and others. As you give diligence to the first three compartments, you become capable of more because like attracts like.\n\n**Compartment 1:** \n\n\\*Awareness of the experiences you want to call your own. \n\n\\*In default-mode, it is an awareness of the experiences you are currently having, and their limitations.\n\n**Compartment 2:** \n\n\\*Awareness of who you are, and all your great attributes. \n\n\\*In default-mode, it is an awareness of who you currently believe yourself to be.\n\n**Compartment 3:** \n\n\\*Awareness of your co-creators great attributes. \n\n\\*In default-mode, it is an awareness of what you currently believe and feel about others.\n\nThe fourth compartment is the expansion of your mind and the strengthening of your gravity. The fourth compartment, if not done, will not stop you from getting results. In fact, if you don't work on the first four compartments and apply the last four compartments, you will attract what you have always attracted, only faster. This may be necessary for some of you to get an idea of where you are currently positioned, so by no means do I shun this approach.\n\n**Compartment 4:** \n\n\\*Your focusing to calibrate and strengthen your gravity in order to attract the elements and co-creators needed for a specific experience. \n\n\\*In default-mode, it is staying aware of the immediate reality that currently surrounds you. \n\nThe next step, which is the fifth compartment, is the initiation of the collapse. In this step, you recite the ultimate attraction and manifestation mantra which is, \u201cI am ready.\u201d When you say these words and mean it and feel it, followed by your setting forth to action with motion, the first four compartments hit a short circuit with your reality and proceed into a collapse mode. This is because your attention gets redirected and you are leaving the scene (so to say) which is what initiates the collapse of your thought-energy into this physical reality. \n\n**Compartment 5:** \n\n\\*Your readiness, your intentions, and your motion. \n\n\\*In default-mode, it is your current intentions and motion as it always has been.\n\nNext is the sixth compartment which is staying in the moment. What I'm talking about is keeping your full attention at the moment where your physical body is. All journeys start with a first step and you can only move upwards, one step at a time. Therefore, you must remain in the only place you can make the first step, and that is in the present moment. \n\nBeing here and now, at the moment, allows for attractions to take place and for new experiences to begin. It's the centrifugal clutch in the attraction machine which, in turn, is the centrifugal clutch in the manifestation machine. If your mind is always somewhere else, then your energy is somewhere else. If your energy is somewhere else, then your desires can't catch up to you. Keep your intentions, energy, and expectations in the present moment with you. \n\n**Compartment 6:** \n\n\\*Belonging and having a presence in the present by staying in the moment.\n\n\\*In default-mode, it is your selective belonging to specific people, places, and situations according to how you have always belonged. Your mind will always be in the moment you would rather be in when in compartment-six default-mode.\n\nNext is the seventh compartment which regards the key factors or elements needed to nurture an experience. These key factors are also the physical evidence or proof of your success in deliberately attracting and manifesting. Compartment-seven is where you focus on the people, places, and things that would enhance your experience by helping you relate to the experience in the way you desire. For example, If a man wants to socialize at elegant parties, then he is going to need a high-end tailored suit if he wants to belong to an experience like that. In a case like this, the suit is merely a tool to help him belong to the elegant-party experience how he would like to belong to it. Therefore, a high-end tailored suit is one of the elements needed to complete the elegant-party experience. \n\nThat said, the elements you wish to attract are merely tools to aid you in having an experience the way you want to have an experience. These are the tools you need for you to belong to the experiences you desire in the way you would like to belong to them. This is the compartment where you stay aware of the key elements that make your desired experiences inevitable if they are present the way you want them to be present in your life.\n\n**Compartment 7:** \n\n\\*Seeking the key elements you need in order to intentionally interact with the experiences you desire, in the way you desire to contribute to them. These elements include people, places, and things.\n\n\\*In default-mode, compartment-seven represents what you currently have in your life as well as who is currently in your life. Compartment-seven represents the tools you use to contribute to your current experiences. Also, compartment-seven represents where you currently live, work, and play. \n\nLast is compartment-eight, and in this compartment (if done in unison with the others) you are in total motion, with full intentions, backed only by your truth and whatever work you put into yourself. This is the compartment where you are at the point of \u201ccashing in.\u201d Compartment-eight deals with the implementation of yourself in attempts to create new relations with your co-creators in order to create new experiences. \n\nYour attention creates gravity which simultaneously draws in and repels factors accordingly. Your co-creators also have a gravity from their awareness which can attract or repel you according to their gravity, in relation to yours. The goal is for you and a co-creator to be in sync and deliberately pull each other together for a specific experience where you will both complement each other. \n\nYour gravity will bring possibilities nearby while repelling everything else if you stay intentional. Once those possibilities are near, your magnetism will click with those possibilities while repelling everything else. Your magnetism flows through your presence-expressed. Your presence-expressed creates an immediate bond once the possibilities gravitate near you if you are on the same wavelength as you were when you focussed on the possibilities. As you click with others, you become something different as a new whole, and that new whole is an experience. Together you create an experience that has its own unique \u201cmolecular\u201d bond.\n\n**Compartment 8:** \n\n\\*Interjection of yourself intentionally with co-creators, places, and things.\n\n\\*In default-mode, it is the interjection of yourself unintentionally with expectations that\n\neverything will remain the same. In default-mode, you will maintain your current way of living according to the direction your environment and your past is taking you. Regardless of whether you have claimed your power or not, compartment-eight is where you express your truth.\n\nThe quality of your life is limited to the compartment you have invested the least amount of willpower in. This means that the quality of your life is only going to be as good as your weakest link. As you grow in life, these different areas grow and balance out with each other. In other words, as one area improves it pulls the others up as they tug it down until they find a balanced point. The same balancing effect applies if a compartment repositions for the worse. Ultimately, you want all eight compartments to be at an optimal point, working in harmony together.\n\n\\~Nicholas D'Arezzo\\~ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOriginal source:\n\n[https://www.afeelingofbelonging.com/post/my-plausible-explanation-for-why-manifesting-lucidly-is-so-frigging-difficult](https://www.afeelingofbelonging.com/post/my-plausible-explanation-for-why-manifesting-lucidly-is-so-frigging-difficult)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 64724, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Plausible Explanation For Why Manifesting Lucidly Is So Frigging Difficult", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572302614, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dnre3q/my_plausible_explanation_for_why_manifesting/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Nuit11", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_al0wd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572167179, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dnqxv1/neolithic_sound_wisdom_numbers_and_their/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dnqxv1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dnqxv1/neolithic_sound_wisdom_numbers_and_their/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572167180, "score": 1, "selftext": "Around one hundred years ago, at the Nuzi site of northern Babylon, an egged shaped envelope with forty nine pebbles inscribed with Cuneiform inscription describing the herd of goats and lambs, was found.

Her father was a marvelous man with thinning hair. As for her mother, she couldn\u2019t remember her that well. There were four children in all, and Marie was the third eldest. Their village had very lush plant life, and she loved to be among the greenery when spring dawned and the flowers bloomed. She liked to be with her mother, father, and siblings in their lovely home. There was only one thing that could take the little girl away: Time. In time, the little girl would grow up and, as was customary, would be sent to a monastery. As it happened, neither her mother nor her father wanted to send their little girl away, but it was the tradition. Marie would soon reluctantly follow her destiny and leave home, although she couldn\u2019t understand why she was being torn away from her mountain, flowers, and family\u2026*\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nHasan was 18 months old when he started kindergarten. He never wanted to leave his mother\u2019s side, but she had to send him there because she was a working mom. There needed to be a feasible solution for her son\u2019s care, and the solution in the city of Mersin during 1978 was a kindergarten named Yurdum Kre\u015f\u2026. Hasan never, really never, liked this particular nursery. He knew he had to go there, but he would still look into his mother\u2019s eyes and plead, \u201cWhy do you take me there?\u201d He was destined to go there, and he knew it, so he was separated from his mother\u2019s arms every morning as a tear trailed down his cheek.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n*Marie was intimidated by the huge building. She had only ever known the small house where her family lived and the tiny church in her village. The monastery, however, was an immense structure. Marie felt tiny before it. She was a small 12-year-old girl. A small girl who had been torn away from her precious mountain and confined to this huge, stone building, just like lots of other girls living there. Marie didn\u2019t have a mother to comfort her at night. She only had her new friends at the dormitory, those horrified little girls\u2026*\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nHasan didn\u2019t know whether he was two, five, or three years old. In fact, he didn\u2019t know his age at all. The only thing he knew was that his mother didn\u2019t take him to the nursery that morning, and he was jubilant about it. He was with his mum rather than in the kindergarten. However, she did take him there at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and the little boy was so disappointed. His teachers took him to a bed, where he cried many tears of sadness. Here he was, in the place he most hated. He settled down with the book they had given him to amuse himself with, but Hasan wouldn\u2019t forget that moment, even after 35 years\u2026 As regards the kindergarten, he would be separated from his mother every morning until the age of eight.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n*Of course, there weren\u2019t just frightened little girls in the monastery. There were also \u201cbig sisters\u201d who were accustomed to monastery life, and these sisters weren\u2019t as pure as they should have been. Lesbianism was common, and the big girls often selected their lovers from the younger girls, even if these younger girls objected. It was the system, and this system would change little Marie\u2019s life forever\u2026*\n\n*Marie\u2019s \u201cbig sister\u201d was the most powerful girl in the entire monastery. Everyone feared her. She terrorized the little girls with her \u201cbodyguards,\u201d and she had fixed her gaze on little Marie from the moment she arrived at the monastery. Timid little Marie had not yet fully comprehended where she was, and she surely didn\u2019t know what being a woman meant. She had just learned what she should do with her period, and now there was this \u201cbig sister\u201d she had to learn about. The girl kept her eyes on Marie during morning prayers, watching her constantly. The other girls started to whisper in Marie\u2019s ear, telling her that she was the property of the big sister now, so she shouldn\u2019t look at other girls.\u201d Marie, however, didn\u2019t quite realize the significance of these words. When she finally did, she sincerely wished that she hadn\u2019t\u2026*\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nKindergarten was not just somewhere that little Hasan disliked\u2014it was a place he hated wholeheartedly. His favorite way to pass the time was to sit alone at the window and stare at the outside world. He preferred to be alone, even during lunchtimes, and his teachers had to drag him to the dining hall. He tried to resist, but he knew he would have to finish off his plate. What\u2019s more, because he was always late, his teacher made him also eat the other children\u2019s leftovers. After all, why waste the food?  \nOne day, during the celebratory day of national sovereignty, which was also children\u2019s day, the children waited in the nursery for their parents to pick them up. They were left without food and water, and there wasn\u2019t a single teacher to supervise them. Half a loaf of stale bread had been left on the table, and the kids gingerly tried to eat pieces from it. Yes, this is the scene from a private kindergarten in 1982: a bunch of unsupervised children and half a loaf of stale bread\u2026\n\nYet this wasn\u2019t Hasan\u2019s only nightmare. He had a blonde teacher called G\u00fclten, a stern woman who didn\u2019t hesitate to beat children who disobeyed her. Hasan feared her so much. When his mother took him out of Yurdum Kre\u015f and registered him in another kindergarten, he was on cloud nine. \u201cYay! No more G\u00fclten!\u201d he screamed. But this happiness would be short lived, because after a couple of months, G\u00fclten was transferred to the new nursery. She beat the living daylights out of Hasan one day, just for getting out of bed because he thought his mother had come to pick him up. Hasan was bigger than the other boys now, so they had started putting him to sleep in a separate room. There was no one else around, and G\u00fclten didn\u2019t hesitate to kick him in the belly. How dare this child get out of bed during sleep hour; how dare he?\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n*Two girls held down Marie\u2019s arms as they pressed her to the bed. There was no one else in the dorm, as if it had been deliberately cleared for this event. Marie screamed at the top of her lungs, but the girls told her to stop or she would make it worse for herself. The \u201cbig sister\u201d had a long, thick stick in her hand. Marie had twice seen her father bathing, and she thought that the hewn wooden stick in the big sister\u2019s hand resembled a male organ, but this thought gave her just a moment of relief. She grew terrified as the big sister prepared to put it into her\u2026*\n\n*Marie had rejected the big sister up to that day. How could she do the things she did? They were in a house of God after all. What\u2019s more, Marie didn\u2019t know much about intimate relationships. Still, the big sister continued harassing her, and she was tired of being rejected. That night she took action and cornered Marie with her personal thugs. Marie was helpless and desperate. She tried to resist, but her struggles were hopeless. There was no way she could escape, so she prepared herself for the pain the wooden object would inflict on her\u2026*\n\n*Yet the object never entered her. The \u201cbig sister\u201d stopped short at the last moment and said with a terrifying face, \u201cI won\u2019t be as merciful next time. I\u2019ll just ram it straight in. Get it through your thick skull that you\u2019re mine now.\u201d*\n\n*Marie would later prepare herself for the days to come\u2026*\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nHasan pleaded, \u201cBurak, let go of me! Please!\u201d He was now a big boy in second grade. Burak was his classmate, and he worshipped him, but Burak bullied Hasan constantly. This time he was strangling little Hasan and refusing to let go. This had continued through the whole of break time, but Hasan hadn\u2019t done anything other than plead to be released. He would remember the feeling, even after 30 years as he wrote his story. He desperately pleaded, but Burak still didn\u2019t let go, and this feeling of desperation would live on in Hasan for a lifetime.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n*Marie was now the big sister\u2019s lover, or more accurately, her property. She didn\u2019t object to her demands, and amazingly, she actually had come to like it. While she had merely submitted to her at first, she had later started to respond to her lover. She actually looked forward to bedtime. Meanwhile, time ticked on, and little Marie grew up with each new day.*\n\n*One day, a young priest was introduced to the monastery. Marie saw him at the ceremony and was very much taken with him. Marie was a beautiful girl indeed now, but the priest wasn\u2019t interested in her. He wasn\u2019t even looking around. Marie soon started longing for the services where she could see her priest. She even got to exchange a couple of words with him once.*\n\n*Even though she admired her priest during the daytime, she belonged to the big sister at night, and the big sister belonged to her. After growing up a little and spending many nights with the big sister, Marie\u2019s fears had started to wear off. She had come to enjoy the idea of being the lover of the most powerful girl and benefiting from her power. Her fears had turned into a desire for power. No one else could touch her as she grew more powerful. This power, however, derived from her \u201cbig sister,\u201d and Marie had to do as she was told to keep hold of this power.*\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nHasan liked to play football. He also liked watching it. One day, as his father checked his lottery ticket, Hasan heard that the lottery winner was called Fenerbah\u00e7e, and he immediately liked that name. He knew there was a football club with the same name, so he told people he was a \u201cFenerbah\u00e7e fan.\u201d Blue, the team\u2019s color, was his favorite color anyway. One day as he climbed the stairs at school, Burak approached him and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not a Fenerbah\u00e7e fan anymore; you\u2019re a Be\u015fikta\u015f fan now. Got it?\u201d Hasan feared Burak, so with a burning desire to appease him, he said, \u201cSure, I\u2019m a Be\u015fikta\u015f fan.\u201d He meant it as well. He unexpectedly grew very fond of the team, and after a number of years, he met with Burak, the boy he had once feared so much. They watched a Be\u015fika\u015f match in a caf\u00e9, and Hasan hugged and embraced his old friend, telling people that it was Burak who had made him a Be\u015fikta\u015f fan.\n\nThey watched this match against Fenerbah\u00e7e together, and the match went down in history because Be\u015fikta\u015f defeated Fenerbah\u00e7e in their home of Kad\u0131k\u00f6y. Two friends, both fans of Be\u015fikta\u015f, hugged each other every time Be\u015fikta\u015f scored\u2026\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n*Marie was losing her senses. How could she do this to her? How on earth could her big sister tell her that she was bored of her? How could she take another lover from the new kids? What was that about? Marie burned with rage. She didn\u2019t know quite what to do, but she knew she surely had to do something about it.*\n\n*The solution came from a least expected source: The High Priest. She had always liked the man, and she sympathized with him. He had once told her, \u201cI see a big potential in you that you\u2019ve yet to understand.\u201d Marie had readily accepted these kind words during her stay in the monastery, but she had no idea what they meant. One day, when she was in a rage, she stumbled upon the High Priest. He said nothing when he saw her expression, but he took her off to one side. \u201cBe ready tonight, and tell no one that you\u2019re going to see me.\u201d Marie had no intention of telling anyone, and she felt that she was on the brink of a significant development.*\n\n*When they met up that night, the priest asked her to follow him. They told other people that they were going to see a parishioner in town. They left the monastery, and the priest took Marie to a cottage in the middle of the forest. It was not easy to find the cottage, and Marie recalled passing through this part of the forest many times without ever realizing there was a cottage here. \u201cHow come I never noticed this cottage before?\u201d she asked. The priest smiled as he replied with an expression that was far from benign, \u201cEverything will soon become clear.\u201d*\n\n*When they walked in, Marie found herself in some sort of laboratory, and it would change her life forever. There were bottles of all shapes and sizes on the walls. There were strange things that she knew nothing of, and a large table stood in the middle of the room. There was also another slightly taller table.*\n\n*Marie was about to learn the first rules of dark magic.*\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nMany years passed as little Hasan grew up, married, and had two children of his own. He was now an author who wrote about aspects of spiritualism. He still felt his troubles from his long-past childhood, so he sought a solution to cure his groundless fears, his uncontrollable anger, the darkness he knew was boiling inside, and his desire to ingratiate himself with the powerful. He had taken part in numerous spiritual practices since embarking on his journey of self-discovery, and through these, he had untied many of the knots within him. However, he was particularly curious about a certain practice known as \u201cregression therapy.\u201d Hasan hankered after a session, which he believed would be a visit to his past lives with the help of hypnosis. Sure, he had already recalled various visions and emotions from his past lives during his other spiritual explorations, but he was curious about the feeling that hypnosis would provide him. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t know whom he should go to, because he believed hypnosis to be a sensitive and personal process. After mulling it over for some time, he met someone he felt he could trust. Two years later, they were ready to start working together\u2026\n\nThe therapist informed Hasan thoroughly before the session. He explained how regression is not an attempt to hypnotize people so they can remember their past lives. He also said that this therapy wasn\u2019t provided on demand. He explained the essence of the matter, \u201cEach practitioner is different, and each subject requires a different method. Hypnosis is not always needed; it\u2019s just used when required. I first try to understand the nature of a subject and his or her problems before starting a session. I listen to them before proceeding with what I think to be the most suitable method. Not every counselee will visit his or her past lives. If the problem is caused by a past life, then sure, we\u2019ll definitely explore it, but it may not be so easy if the subject is hesitant. Some are open to it, while others are not. Some problems are not from a past life but rather from childhood. Any regression therapy is unique to the person receiving it.\u201d This explanation continued for almost an hour.\n\nHe also informed me about the governing bodies for regression therapists around the world, making sure to underline the importance of strict and intense training. He said, \u201cWe do not accept everyone who applies for training. There is a preselection phase before the lengthy training process begins. Our students can become certified regression therapists only after they present case studies. We refer some of our consultees to our students. This is a highly valued opportunity, but few therapists can do it justice. Many people with little knowledge claim they can administer regression therapy, but it\u2019s too risky for such novices. You may encounter some cases that require real expertise; otherwise regression therapy could do more harm than good. I have worked on over 3,000 cases so far, and this has given me ample opportunities to improve my methods. My consultees and I have contributed much to each other, but I cannot accept any new clients because I cannot keep up with the demand. So, I refer them to my students instead. I\u2019d appreciate it if you don\u2019t mention my name when you talk about your experiences here.\u201d\n\nAfter this lengthy conversation, they were ready to start the session\u2026\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n*Young, timid Marie started to become a much feared and powerful \u201cbig sister\u201d in her own right with the aid of her newly learned craft. Her command and influence on other girls in the monastery became stronger, and since her master was the High Priest himself, no one could oppose her. The High Priest taught his student everything he knew about the dark art, knowledge he had himself learned from a gypsy. He knew his student would soon be going places. The darkness from which Marie drew her power became increasingly darker, giving her more and more strength. She was a powerful and feared person now, and she reveled in the feeling. Besides, she had a need for vengeance, and boy did she get it, big time. Marie made the life of her former \u201cbig sister\u201d a living hell. She first became a rival to her and excluded her completely. Finally, she banished her consciousness. She had made a zombie out of the big sister, and the girl didn\u2019t even know which realm she was in anymore. Marie worked hard to ensure her situation would never improve, even though the girl was nothing but an empty shell\u2026*\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nThe therapist asked a question before they started the first session: \u201cWe approach a particular problem during a regression session. What would you like to work on today?\u201d\n\nHasan replied, \u201cLet\u2019s work on my anger and fears. I feel some tension around my belly at the moment, so shall we address that first?\u201d\n\nWhile they believed this session would revolve around the tension in his stomach area, they found something quite unexpected. They discovered that Hasan\u2019s past-life memories actually belonged to another being. He was harboring a foreign energy in his energy field, and he needed to say goodbye to it in order to free himself. This farewell relieved his fears and anger, but they weren\u2019t completely banished. When he returned for his second session, his stomach was in agony, so much so that he almost cried.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s work on my relationship patterns,\u201d asked Hasan, \u201cWhy do I keep attracting the same type of people? What is it that I\u2019m failing to see? Why do I invite dominant women into my life?\u201d After a couple of minutes, Hasan was lying on the ground, panting and crying out, \u201cI\u2019m giving birth and being born at the same time. It hurts so much\u2026\u201d\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n*Marie was shouting and screaming. She was in incredible pain. Nuns were standing around her, and while they disapproved, they were still going to help this \u201cchild of sin\u201d to be born. A sister was giving birth in the monastery! This unbelievable scene was about to get even darker. Marie screamed one last time as she felt something sliding out of her. The nuns stared in horror at what had come out. None of them had the stomach to pick up the baby. They were wildly praying and crossing themselves. Everyone was in a tremendous panic, and they soon started to run away. Marie was lying on the table with her legs spread open and an uncut umbilical cord hanging out\u2026*\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n\u201cI saw my baby\u2019s father for a moment, but just a moment. I can\u2019t stand it any longer,\u201d said Hasan as he lay on the ground, weary and exhausted. He had experienced childbirth, and now he was experiencing death. \u201cMy spirit is gone, gone damn it!\u201d he cried. Hasan then sensed a great relief in his body and completely collapsed on the rug of the therapist\u2019s room.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n*Marie was dead. She was detached from her body, feeling lighter and relieved, yet she still watched the world below. She looked at her body and then at the creature lying between her thighs\u2026*\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nThe therapist led Hasan with questions like, \u201cLet\u2019s go back a little in time now. Tell me what you see.\u201d\n\nHasan then started to recount Marie\u2019s story, \u201cOne day, I trapped the young priest in his room. Years had passed since he first came to the monastery, and he had started liking me too. A man of God would surely not follow his desires, however, so I needed to take action myself. I raped him.\u201d It was Marie talking through Hasan. She conceived her baby after their fourth sexual encounter, and she worked a very dark spell on the unborn baby. She didn\u2019t want her baby to be weak like she had been, so she cast something called a \u201cBlack Dragon Spell.\u201d This spell had considerable side effects, so it made the baby deformed. This dehumanized baby had then taken her life.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n*She was dead, yet she wasn\u2019t completely at peace. Sure, she felt much better and lighter now, but she was also trapped in this world. She felt like she was dead, yet she could not quite make the transition. It was as if she was imprisoned in a dark cage. She could not escape the monastery\u2026*\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n\u201cMake sure you know you\u2019re dead,\u201d said the therapist.  \n\u201cI am,\u201d Marie replied, but I can\u2019t get out. I made something immortal with magic, and it has confined me to this building. I can\u2019t even move.\u201d\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n*Marie heard a voice calling out to her, \u201cIt\u2019s over now; it\u2019s in the past. You are dead. You can relax. It\u2019s all over now. Come on, you can get out of here.\u201d She had no idea where the voice was coming from, but she felt herself become lighter and lighter. The dark prison around her was slowly dismantling itself, letting in a little light. Just then, she saw her \u201cbig sister.\u201d She was rolled up into a ball in desperation. She didn\u2019t even know she was dead. Soon, the voice called out to her as well. She gradually came around, just as Marie had a while ago. Marie then saw her mother and father, the priest, and the High Priest\u2026 They all started to transform into beings of radiant light. Their burdens were gone, and the performance was now over. They were ready to take a bow and leave the stage. They saw each other as they were, their faces bright with the gratification of success. They had completed a marvelous play with a great story, and they were ready to move on now. As they started to slowly fade, Marie heard the faint sound of drumming\u2026*\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n\u201cNow, I\u2019ll beat the drum for you as you say goodbye to her, Hasan. This story is over now. It\u2019s time for you to kiss her goodbye. Off we go\u2026\u201d said the therapist. He then started to rhythmically beat the shaman drum in his hand.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n*Marie suddenly found herself in another body, a male body. She didn\u2019t know how, but she felt attached to him, tied together somehow. She started to drift away with the help of the rhythmic drumming before completely breaking free. She emerged from his belly first, followed by his whole body. When she looked back, she saw a tall male body lying on the ground. Another man stood beside him playing a drum. The sound of the drum was magical. The body on the ground was convulsing as Marie came out. Suddenly, she understood who this man was. He was her in another body\u2026*\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nHasan was shaking all over. He felt the presence of the woman standing beside him and knew this woman was him. He said, \u201cWhile I thought I had seen many of my past lives, I never felt your presence until today. I didn\u2019t know you had so much influence on me, but it\u2019s over now, Marie. You can rest now; we can both rest easy. It\u2019s over.\u201d The last connection between them then broke. Marie looked back at him for one last time before going to the source\u2026\n\nHasan felt enormous relief as he opened his eyes. He looked at the therapist and his words spilled out of his mouth, \u201cWow! Good grief\u2026\u201d\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nThey later sat and evaluated the session. The therapist commented, \u201cInteresting, what initially surfaces in a session is usually the past lives where the person was a victim, but you were both a victim and a perpetrator here. I wonder how much this has affected your current life\u2026\u201d\n\nHasan also saw the connections between his life and that of Marie. He recalled how he had used the words, \u201cIt\u2019s as if I have a black dragon in my belly,\u201d in his articles from time to time. He told the therapist, \u201cI never thought I meant it literally,\u201d and laughed. He had faced the reason behind his fears, his anger, his lust for power, his inclination to darkness, and his attraction to dominant women. It was all so fast. Facing this had enabled the knots to come undone.\n\nIt was very important at this point for the therapist to know how to direct the consultee, so they could make the necessary arrangements together. \u201cEveryone can see their past lives,\u201d he explained, \u201cbut the important part is what you plan to do with it. If you can interpret this knowledge and help people overcome their problems, that\u2019s fine. But if you just want to see who you were in a past life out of curiosity, then count me out. I don\u2019t work with such people, because no one benefits from it. Besides, the further you dig, the more memories you recall. What\u2019s important is the benefit it provides to your current reality. We\u2019ll have a couple more sessions together, and you\u2019ll gradually feel a significant relief. We\u2019ll lift the weight off so you can act more easily and freely. However, bear in mind that your journey continues constantly, and there may be other knots to untie. In a sense, this is how we live our lives; we evolve. Spiritual evolution doesn\u2019t mean the evolution of the spirit. The spirit doesn\u2019t evolve, because it\u2019s already as mighty as it can be. What we do is develop our brains and nervous functions, so we can feel and appreciate the spirit more. This is what spiritual evolution means. It\u2019s the process of educating one\u2019s body to better feel the spirit. That\u2019s what I use regression for.\u201d\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nHasan\u2019s eyes opened sharply at seven the next morning. Something told him that he should write down his experiences. Maybe it was Marie telling him this. Maybe she wanted her story to be told. \u201cGetting up at 7 am? Seriously?\u201d he said to himself as he closed his eyes again. But something kept nagging him, so he abruptly tumbled out of bed. He took a very quick shower and sat at the computer. After the first clatter of key presses, the cursor blinked next to some words, waiting for more to follow: \u201c*Marie was a young girl who lived in a small mountain village with her family\u2026*\u201d\n\n  \nHasan Sonsuz Celiktas  \n[www.thewisemag.com](https://www.thewisemag.com)   \n[editor@thewisemag.com](mailto:editor@thewisemag.com)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 64720, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Marie and Hasan: A Tale of Regression Therapy", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572301859, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dnqr9e/marie_and_hasan_a_tale_of_regression_therapy/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "afierywitch", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4bglmie4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572162876, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dnqevi/dreams_and_manifestations_of_snakes_spirit_animal/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dnqevi", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dnqevi/dreams_and_manifestations_of_snakes_spirit_animal/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572162879, "score": 1, "selftext": "I started my journey to spiritually a little over a year ago. I was already aware of my somewhat inherited ability to see premonitions and messages through me dreams, so I assumed at first that me dreaming of snakes was just a representation of my fears and insecurities. That was, until, I started to notice that not all dreams I have of snakes are hostile. Some are actually quite calm. It's not the same species of snake every time I dream of one, but still. I also started to notice that ever since I opened up to this possibility snakes have appeared more often in my life. I've found two dead snakes on the road near my house, my father's cat has laid on (yes, laid on... He is rather ballsy, even for a cat), three live black racer snakes, and while on a family vacation recently I almost stepped on a black racer. Earlier this year a water snake I found at a swamp nearly bit me, and now we found a corn snake near my house and he is the calmest snake I have ever found despite being a wild animal.\n\nI've never necessarily had a \"phobia\" or \"fear\" of snakes, more like a respectful awareness of their usual boundaries. Still, it seems that they just love to appear out of nowhere no matter where I am. I've never had this many encounters with snakes- dead or alive- within one year until now.

I have regained my memory by Your mercy, and I am now firm and free from doubt and am prepared to act according to Your instructions.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe constitutional position of a living entity, represented by Arjuna, is that he has to act according to the order of the Supreme Lord. He is meant for self-discipline. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu says that the actual position of the living entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forgetting this principle, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in serving the Supreme Lord, he becomes the liberated servant of God. The living entity's constitutional position is to be servitor; he either has to serve the illusory m\u0101y\u0101 or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord, he is in his normal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory external energy, then certainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in this material world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as the master of the world. This is called illusion. When a person is liberated, his illusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme to act according to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare of m\u0101y\u0101 to trap the living entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity thinks that he is no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent that he does not think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That he does not consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become free from the illusory energy is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and agree to act according to His order. The word moha\u1e25 is very important in this verse. Moha\u1e25 refers to that which is opposed to knowledge. Actually real knowledge is the understanding that every living being is eternally servitor of the Lord, but instead of thinking oneself in that position, the living entity thinks that he is not servant, that he is the master of this material world, for he wants to lord it over the material nature. That is his illusion. This illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the Lord or by the mercy of a pure devotee. When that illusion is over, one agrees to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is acting according to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's order. A conditioned soul illusioned by the external energy of matter does not know that the Supreme Lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor of everything. Whatever He desires He can bestow upon His devotees; He is the friend of everyone, and He is especially inclined to His devotee. He is the controller of this material nature and of all living entities. He is also the controller of inexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all potencies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the devotee. One who does not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does not become a devotee, but a servitor of m\u0101y\u0101. Arjuna, however, after hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, became free from all illusion. He could understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was not only his friend, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And he understood K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a factually. So to study Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a factually. When a person is in full knowledge, he naturally surrenders to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When Arjuna understood that it was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's plan to reduce the unnecessary increase of population, he agreed to fight according to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's desire. He again took up his weapons-his arrows and bow-to fight under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 1 : \"The word moha\u1e25 is very important in this verse\".

I've never seen ghosts, or spirits. The most spiritual experience I've ever had is feeling negative entities trying to pull me out of my body, and hearing them whispering in other languagesI couldn't understand, and even though I believe they were negative entities, and it immediately stopped when I either called upon the name of Jesus, or told it no, I have to use healthy skepticism and acknowledge that it could very well have been just sleep paralysis. I'm not schizophrenic. Probably the craziest spirt experience  I ever had fully awake, and not forced into a sleep paralysis, was lights flashing in my car when I was really little, and then the lights responding to my questions, like \"If there's anything in here, turn on the light\", and it did that a few times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, here's my question. I've always felt drawn to spiritual things, but since my eighteenth birthday, it got more intense. I never want to start dabbling in any dark arts, so the furthest I've gone is meditating with binaural beats, which I started 3 or 4 days ago. I don't wish to interact with any non angelic spirits, or astral project, at least not right now. But today, while listening to the Truthseekah podcast, I finally prayed to Jesus, that if he wanted to open my third eye or give me any spiritual experience, I wouldn't resist, and I would like to have said experiences, but only if it was his will, as I don't want to force any doors open that weren't meant to be opened. No desire whatsoever. A few minutes later, the area around my \"third eye chakra\", starts tingling, and it does that on and off throughout today. The tingling expanded to my chin, and it varies in intensity, but when its most intense, its slight pressure and tingling across my forehead, and on my lower jaw and cheeks, and I feel slightly slightly slightly high. I googled this, and apparently this is a sign of my third eye opening. Has anyone had any experience with this.

You've spent years longing for this union, to find her, reach her, and embrace her.\n\nYou\u2019ve searched and looked for her in countless hearts, eyes, bodies, and smells. You hoped that it would be her every time. But it did not happen, even after reaching a certain level, and then came the rest, falling into an infinite oblivion.\n\nBut now you\u2019re looking at her. She is there in front of you once again. You are melting into the ocean of your heart. It embraces your every particle, and nothing is left untouched. You are one with *love* in your beloved\u2019s infinite heart.\n\nEntranced by love, your body is busy releasing all manner of hormones that you\u2019ve never heard of. Your eyes are different, like everything is different now, all bright and shiny.\n\nYou look at the dear people passing you by. Your lips smile differently, and your words enchant in a whole new way. Your dear friends treat you differently as well. \u201cYou\u2019re different! What happened to you?\u201d they say smilingly. You just lean your head back as laughter bursts out of you, but not for too long, though. How can you describe your state? Once you mention love, you\u2019ll be told that it\u2019s all about browsing Instagram.\n\nThose poor souls not in love, those still looking for their beloved, think that\u2019s all there is to love. Of course, you know they will also encounter this state one day. Once upon a time, you were just the same. You assumed that another person, another identity, another body, would present the offer of love to you. Haven\u2019t you had many fights over something you thought to be love, demanding to be given this or that. But now you realize that was something else, certainly not love. You do not think the word \u201clove\u201d is enough to describe this state, where the smell of your beloved circulates through your soul\u2026.\n\nYou want to taste love. You extend your lips towards her luscious and moist lips. You kiss softly again and again, but not with greed! It\u2019s not mechanical\u2014it\u2019s something else.\n\nYour eyes to her eyes, your smell in hers, your lips on her lips, she whispers in your ear, \u201cI\u2019ve waited too long for you, but no longer than you\u2019ve waited for me. I\u2019ve always known that you would come to me, so I waited patiently. I watched the agony of your being all the while. I called out to you many times. I said, \u2018I am here, my love, patiently waiting for you, longing for you with all my being.\u2019 But your ears couldn\u2019t hear me among the pain back then. I couldn\u2019t reach you, yet I never stopped calling out to you. I knew you would come. We were promised in love\u2019s breath\u2026\u201d\n\nYou inhale her aroma once more with a deep breath, your body trembling in awe. The might that has been sleeping within you all this time begins to rise and capture you. Your hands are merely feathers caressing the back of your beloved. You touch her with the yearning of millions of years. With your gentle touches, her breath quickens, and she opens herself to you. You know you are flowing into her body with compassion and love. You are not the only ones becoming *one*. You know that each and every cell in your bodies are uniting with each other. Trillions are becoming *one* in you and her. The *two* becoming *one* swim in an ocean of love and increasing sensuality.\n\nBreath to breath, body to body, mind to mind, and soul to soul, you are uniting together and becoming inseparable. Why would anyone want to separate you anyway, if they witness this act of becoming *one.* You know that sooner or later, everyone will experience this as their bodies begin to tremble. All that is left to do is celebrate this love.\n\nAnd now you are completely lost in your beloved, just as she has melted into you. Where does one start and the other end? You do not know. Is there a beginning and an end to any of it? You wanted to travel the universe, but you\u2019ve come to realize that you are the universe. You are all the dimensions you mentioned. \u201cWhat about my loved ones,\u201d you say suddenly. You come to realize there\u2019s nothing left in your being that you do not like, though.\n\nThe lover and the loved one, the masculine and the feminine, the Yin and Yang: There may be many analogies to describe you and her. Yet they all sound funny to you, so you just sway within the breeze of love.\n\nThis is what you desired, what you\u2019ve always wanted. Now you\u2019ve found her, you can stay here forever, where there is infinite trust, love, peace, and so much more. It\u2019s all here! What more could you want? You are eternally thankful and sincerely satisfied right now. You let yourself go completely and surrender to what *is*.\n\nYou do not know how long you\u2019ve been in this state, but you suddenly feel your lover\u2019s hands touching you with compassion. You open your eyes, and there you are, eye to eye, looking at each other. You see her body and your body, and you\u2019re a little surprised. Why did we separate like this and stop being *one*? You could\u2019ve been *one* together forever.\n\nShe smiles once again, her tempting smell drifting over to you, and says, \u201cHere I am, always, with you and with love.\u201d But then some words that are difficult to accept enter your ears: \u201cNow you must go back to earth!\u201d\n\nYou want to object as soon as you hear this: \u201cWhy back to earth? Why? Why? I found you in this moment, so why do you make me leave again? Did I do something wrong? Why are we separating again? Why?\u201d  \nYour breath quickens as you suddenly fall from there with fear, worry, and anxiety all attacking your body. But she touches you with compassion once more. This touch expresses trust, but why is it all ending? Why must you separate once again?\n\nYou lean into her ear and catch her smell\u2014oh that smell! Are you to be deprived of it again! Your insides pain greatly at this prospect.\n\nThan her words begin to pour into your soul:\n\n*\u201cNever! There\u2019s no more separation in the moment. I am here every time you use a finger. In every cell of yours there is my love. I have melted into your soul, and now you\u2019ll see, hear, feel, taste, and smell me in your every moment on Earth.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cYou must return my love! You must explore every state of our being. We promised each other we would meet again, and you would return. Many lovers walked down this road with love and could not return. Yes, that\u2019s a choice too, my love, to melt together into the ocean of love and stay there. But please go back and remind others about the path of love. Help those burning for love by telling them that their beloved is waiting for them in the eternity of time.*\n\n*And say this to them: \u2018Your beloveds wait for you in patience. They will celebrate your arrival but not regret your departure, because they know you can visit whenever you want once you know the way. They wait to see the world through your eyes.

It started 10 or so years ago with a boom leant to me by my moms friend. \n\nLife has been good to me. I have 3 fantastic kids and a great wife and a dog I adore, a great friend group who I have known since we were kids and I live in a great part of the world. We\u2019ve had our fair share of hard times too. \n\nAnyway it was the hard times that really propelled me to where I am. A series of events that started with my wife having a very late miscarriage and having to give birth to him, then my daughter very nearly died a few months later, then my dad died a few days after that (that was complicated because he was a junky and we had a rough relationship) then my business collapsed and I had a break down. Or if I\u2019m being honest with my self I was having a breakdown and collapsed my business. Either way I went from running a successful design agency, fancy offices, big name clients like tv chefs and stuff, to having nothing, over night. Oh and I have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol and weed. Not a raging alcoholic like my dad but still a problem. I love smoking weed even though I know it\u2019s destructive for me.  I have had periods where I smoke all day every day. \n\nDuring this time I almost completely lost my sense of identity, I wasn\u2019t a designer anymore, i didn\u2019t care what I looked like, what people thought of me,I didn\u2019t give a shit about that anymore, It all seemed so meaningless and blah. \n\nAnyway after a month or so of what felt like total despair and being very lost (and broke) I got a job with an old friend of my mums, an old hippy who is a gardener. He got me a job working along side him, such a lovely soft sole. I worked with him and another guy for a year, clearing a valley, using chainsaws, working the land and, well I guess figuring out who I was again. But I\u2019d forgotten all about my spiritual side, so I stumbled through life for the next few years, going from one job to another, feeling lost and really just surviving. \n\nThen about 2 years ago I started meditating again. I started to remember the power in that. I felt an urge to go back to being vegetarian and a renewed connection to nature, then I re read and am still reading a bunch of books I read years ago by people like Wayne dyer, Elkhart Tolle and esther hicks. I am learning reiki and animal communication and have learned that I am a healer. I am more spiritual then I have ever been and it is amazing. The universe is amazing, I am so lucky and grateful. I have a knowing that I am on the right path. Life is amazing. \n\nBut with that also comes a feeling of frustration and the feeling that I am in the wrong place, surrounded by people who I have less of a connection with day by day. It is confusing. these people are not spiritual but I love them dearly and do not judge them on their beliefs. It was never a problem before. But the further down this road I go, the less I want to spend time with them. I just want to spend time walking with my dog rather than chatting shit in the pub. Or surfing with my son and talking about life with him. \n\nThis is the hardest for me to admit. I have nothing In common with my wife and she is not at all spiritual and this is tough. She has put up with so much, helped me through that tough patch by keeping everything ticking over, and put up with me. \n\nIs it normal ? \n\nWhy am I feeling so distant from everyone who I hold so dear?  \n\nWhy do I have this deep feeling, or even knowing that I am in the wrong place. With the wrong people around me. I can\u2019t just up and leave. I feel very guilty for even feeling like this. \n\nI have thought about this a lot but I have no distance from it, no clear perspective if that makes sense..? I guess I\u2019m hoping someone will just say it\u2019s normal and do this and it will fix... lol. \n\nAh Fuck knows. I feel a bit lost and confused again and it\u2019s a tad scary. \n\nSorry that was even longer than I imagined... \n\nThanks for reading x", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 64519, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Struggling with my old friends", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572282641, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dn5m3t/struggling_with_my_old_friends/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Texasandersonrobot", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4vk0d4oi", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572042397, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dn4wca/theres_this_woman/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dn4wca", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dn4wca/theres_this_woman/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572042398, "score": 1, "selftext": "Here name keeps popping up in my brain man\n\nI moved to the city she comes from\n\nWhat should i do?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 64511, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Theres this woman", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572282057, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dn4wca/theres_this_woman/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ab33699", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4q1ji8a8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572040255, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dn4eyx/divided_attraction/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dn4eyx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General"}], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dn4eyx/divided_attraction/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572040260, "score": 1, "selftext": "Here\u2019s an article trying to sum up consciousness in as brief and layman as possible.

That was weird, as I so rarely use cash that you'd be hard-pressed to find *any* coins in my car or anywhere else.  The very next day I had to take my husband's truck to Home Depot for some large items.  He's been using his work truck and hasn't been in our truck for quite some time - yet there were two dimes in the cupholder.\n\nAnd it's been dimes everywhere since.  On the dining room table, kitchen island, even one on the kitchen counter just now when I went to grab the bread to make a sandwich.  Not only did I just make myself a sandwich last night and there was no dime there, but I have the house to myself for several days so I'm the only one here.  I even stopped at a convenience store today, and after I paid and grabbed my things off the counter, I noticed a lone dime sitting there.  I also just remembered last week, the day after I came home, my husband mentioned finding a dime on the ground right outside the front door.\n\nNice to think that my relative is with me :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 64495, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Finding dimes...", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572280867, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dn3ggu/finding_dimes/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "thedeadauthor", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4t5lawzr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572035645, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dn3dgu/how_do_you_regard_sociopaths/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dn3dgu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7c9589ac-8418-11e7-818d-0e2b24c88a6a", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dn3dgu/how_do_you_regard_sociopaths/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572035647, "score": 6, "selftext": "I think it's an egomaniacal misunderstanding of oneself/one's consciousness, ergo a false perception of one's reality.  Sociopathic tendencies are perpetuated by society's romanticization of intellect -- to assert that those headed down the drain are \"highly intelligent\" is both crude and counterproductive. An existence ruled by its ego, no matter the mind, will always seek validation (eg. self-serving bias), never fulfillment. Sociopaths are extreme, but still a byproduct of society's vanity, i.e., it's the blind ostracizing the blind for being \"more blind.\" And that's all rooted in this notion that our hopes and dreams are anything but, which is, again, an egoistic desire (for control). I firmly believe that unconditional compassion offers far greater insight into any/all human natures; in order to understand why some lack, you must first understand/achieve \"oneness\" within. With this inundation of mental illnesses, I can't help but think the world has lost its grapples on reality. Assuming that your emotions are wrong and must be stopped, cured, suppressed, et al. is an internal power struggle that mutes intuition after a while. This crusade for fleeting hopes, pursuit of happiness (and no other emotion, ever), belief that it'll get better without a conscious effort, etc. is the wrong focus.

In other words, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is for the devotees only, but it so happens that sometimes a devotee of the Lord will hold open class, and in that class all the students are not expected to be devotees. Why do such persons hold open class? It is explained here that although everyone is not a devotee, still there are many men who are not envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They have faith in Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If such persons hear from a bona fide devotee about the Lord, the result is that they become at once free from all sinful reactions and after that attain to the planetary system where all righteous persons are situated. Therefore simply by hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, even a person who does not try to be a pure devotee attains the result of righteous activities. Thus a pure devotee of the Lord gives everyone a chance to become free from all sinful reactions and to become a devotee of the Lord.  \nGenerally those who are free from sinful reaction are righteous. Such persons very easily take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The word pu\u1e47ya-karma\u1e47\u0101m is very significant here. This refers to the performance of great sacrifice. Those who are righteous in performing devotional service but who are not pure can attain the planetary system of the polestar, or Dhruvaloka, where Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is presiding. He is a great devotee of the Lord, and he has a special planet which is called the polestar.  \n**Question 1 : Why the word pu\u1e47ya-karma\u1e47\u0101m is very significant with reference to this verse ?**\n\n[Picture : Bhagavad-gita 18.70-71](https://gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/70-71)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 64435, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 18.70-71", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572275066, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dmwimn/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_187071/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "jordb37", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4262t6sc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572001911, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dmvxij/hope_this_helps_a_lil/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dmvxij", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General"}], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "og_description": "", "og_title": "", "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dmvxij/hope_this_helps_a_lil/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572001912, "score": 14, "selftext": "This is a hella personal blog post, but with mental health being so important right now I feel it was important to post.

I was relaxed and feeling good, flying away in my happy place, which is a vast sea with stony neighboring islands. \n\nAround the end of the hypothesis, it said to imagine going down a silver cloud and reaching to a mountain with circling stones. At this point I lost my concentration cause somehow I got really logical about how to go down a silver cloud when I\u2019m hovering over a vast sea. So I tried just diving into the sea and imagining coming out the other side to find that mountain!! Anyway it felt awkward. :))\n\nNonetheless, I go back into concentration mode. At some point, the guide says imagine your higher self coming into that circle, and the first image that came to my mind when it said higher self was kinda scary. She was wearing a white robe, but her head (or mask) was this big deformed and upside down blackish triangle.\n\nAt this point I wasn\u2019t that scared but I got worried that it might get scary so I just stopped.\n\nIt might be worth mentioning these things: 1.

there is no doubt that you are in denial!\n\nWhen your words resonate with freedom, but you secretly try to make everyone a slave to yourself, there is no doubt that you are in denial!\n\nIf you have knowledge, but if you cannot incorporate it into your heart with love and transform it into a state of being, and if you exploit that knowledge to satisfy your selfish desires and manipulate individuals, there is no doubt that you are in denial!\n\nIf you mention God in every sentence, but only pretend to love God, there is no doubt that you are in denial!\n\nIf you talk about being a good human, but continue trying to act \u201ccool\u201d and walk around with frozen curses in your veins, unable to melt them, there is no doubt that you are in denial!\n\nIf you suffer from poverty in the midst of abundance, constantly complaining about it, there is no doubt that you are in denial!\n\nWhile you blame everyone else and avoid taking any responsibility, playing various games to hide your cowardice, there is no doubt that you are in denial!\n\nAs you witness countless miracles, instead of standing in awe, if you keep dismissing them as preposterous, there is no doubt that you are in denial!\n\nWhen your very existence is the real marvel, and proof of this marvel lies all around you, if you still expect miracles to fall from the sky, there is no doubt that you are in denial!\n\nI could document many more of your denials, but they would fill the world\u2019s oceans!\n\nOh dear friend, you are the one in denial, yet all around you lies the proof!\n\nYou deny not only yourself, but also me, us, him, her, and them!\n\nYou are also blind from burying yourself more and more in suffering through your denial while chasing profit in an attempt to escape the deep gutter of denial!\n\nYou are blind, because while every place is filled with divinity, you cannot see it at any moment.\n\nYou refuse what is presented to you but spend whatever comes your way, but in reality, your blindness is your suffering.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nThere is no divine power or otherworldly force causing your suffering\u2014there never was!\n\nHe would never cause you suffering. It is you, believing yourself unworthy of the divine light, who puts yourself through your self-created suffering.\n\nYou punish yourself and cause your own suffering. You deprive yourself of Him, so you may deserve the divine light once again. This was your penance.\n\nIf you consciously did it, you can purify your ruined intentions. You can find the balance for your unbalanced self. You can reconnect with Him, even if you\u2019ve been disconnected for a while. You can isolate yourself from the outside world for a while, and completely with your own consent, you can work to update yourself in the moment\u2026\n\nAlas, you may have unconsciously locked yourself up in this suffering, though. This is not a suitable state for purification. It\u2019s more of a prison or even a torture dungeon. You beat yourself up on the inside as you torture your being, just so you can reach out and reconnect with Him.\n\nBut you also secretly blame Him. \u201cWhy do you hurt me so much?\u201d you ask. You agonize over it and get angry at Him. You say, \u201cI\u2019ll sacrifice myself for you,\u201d before taking up the role of victim and saying, \u201cSee, this is what He gives us!\u201d\n\nThis is where blindness lies, but no one asks you to suffer like this! Nobody said, \u201cThat\u2019s it! Go inside and beat yourself up, so I can maybe accept you back one day!\u201d Perhaps others have treated you like this throughout your life, but they were also your siblings torturing no one else other than themselves. That was the only way they knew, and they naturally led you toward it.\n\nAnd you adopted that tiny room so much, that you even began to resist leaving it, even though you were ruining yourself inside. It also felt like a womb protecting you.\n\nI know you will ask, \u201cHow do you know so much, so clearly, about all this?\u201d Well, I\u2019ve also been beating myself up inside for as long as I can remember. I tortured myself subconsciously, thinking I would become purer the more I suffered. I then caused myself the worst kind of suffering.\n\nNow, the time has come!\n\nI am out of there as of 4:23 pm on April 17, 2018.\n\nMy suffering has ended!\n\nYou can do it too, if you want.\n\nYou can escape the suffering you created subconsciously, right now, and leave behind your victim status and blindness.\n\nWe deprive ourselves of Him, all by ourselves.\n\nMy suffering has ended, though!\n\nIf you feel it too, grab a pen and paper and write down your own rescue date.\n\nThis is also a time to rejoice, both with yourself and with Him.  \n\n\nHasan Sonsuz Celiktas  \neditor@thewisemag.com  \nwww.thewisemag.com", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 64308, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Has Your Suffering Ended?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572228682, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dmjfdj/has_your_suffering_ended/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "NameOfSonOfMan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4h03fdkg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571936389, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dmja4v/acim_chapter_21_introduction_the_forgotten_song/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dmja4v", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dmja4v/acim_chapter_21_introduction_the_forgotten_song/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571936394, "score": 1, "selftext": "Introduction\n\nProjection makes perception. The world you see is what you gave it, nothing more than that. But though it is no more than that, it is not less. Therefore, to you it is important. It is the witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition. As a man thinketh, so does he perceive. Therefore, seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world. Perception is a result and not a cause. And that is why order of difficulty in miracles is meaningless. Everything looked upon with vision is healed and holy. Nothing perceived without it means anything. And where there is no meaning, there is chaos.\n\nDamnation is your judgment on yourself, and this you will project upon the world. See it as damned, and all you see is what you did to hurt the Son of God. If you behold disaster and catastrophe, you tried to crucify him. If you see holiness and hope, you joined the Will of God to set him free. There is no choice that lies between these two decisions. And you will see the witness to the choice you made, and learn from this to recognize which one you chose.\n\nThe Forgotten Song\n\nNever forget the world the sightless \"see\" must be imagined, for what it really looks like is unknown to them. They must infer what could be seen from evidence forever indirect; and reconstruct their inferences as they stumble and fall because of what they did not recognize, or walk unharmed through open doorways that they thought were closed. And so it is with you. You do not see. Your cues for inference are wrong, and so you stumble and fall down upon the stones you did not recognize, but fail to be aware you can go through the doors you thought were closed, but which stand open before unseeing eyes, waiting to welcome you.\n\nHow foolish is it to attempt to judge what could be seen instead. It is not necessary to imagine what the world must look like. It must be seen before you recognize it for what it is. You can be shown which doors are open, and you can see where safety lies; and which way leads to darkness, which to light. Judgment will always give you false directions, but vision shows you where to go. Why should you guess?\n\nThere is no need to learn through pain. And gentle lessons are acquired joyously, and are remembered gladly. What gives you happiness you want to learn and not forget. It is not this you would deny. Your question is whether the means by which this course is learned will bring to you the joy it promises. If you believed it would, the learning of it would be no problem. You are not a happy learner yet because you still remain uncertain  \nthat vision gives you more than judgment does, and you have learned that both you cannot have.\n\nThe blind become accustomed to their world by their adjustments to it. They think they know their way about in it. They learned it, not through joyous lessons, but through the stern necessity of limits they believed they could not overcome. And still believing this, they hold those lessons dear, and cling to them because they cannot see. They do not understand the lessons keep them blind. This they do not believe. And so they keep the world they learned to \"see\" in their imagination, believing that their choice is that or nothing. They hate the world they learned through pain. And everything they think is in it serves to remind them that they are incomplete and bitterly deprived.\n\nThus they define their life and where they live, adjusting to it as they think they must, afraid to lose the little that they have. And so it is with all who see the body as all they have and all their brothers have. They try to reach each other, and they fail, and fail again. And they adjust to loneliness, believing that to keep the body is to save the little that they have. Listen, and try to think if you remember what we will speak of now.\n\nListen,--perhaps you catch a hint of an ancient state not quite forgotten; dim, perhaps, and yet not altogether unfamiliar, like a song whose name is long forgotten, and the circumstances in which you heard completely unremembered. Not the whole song has stayed with you, but just a little wisp of melody, attached not to a person or a place or anything particular. But you remember, from just this little part, how lovely was the song, how wonderful the setting where you heard it, and how you loved those who were there and listened with you.\n\nThe notes are nothing. Yet you have kept them with you, not for themselves, but as a soft reminder of what would make you weep if you remembered how dear it was to you. You could remember, yet you are afraid, believing you would lose the world you learned since then. And yet you know that nothing in the world you learned is half so dear as this. Listen, and see if you remember an ancient song you knew so long ago and held more dear than any melody you taught yourself to cherish since.\n\nBeyond the body, beyond the sun and stars, past everything you see and yet somehow familiar, is an arc of golden light that stretches as you look into a great and shining circle. And all the circle fills with light before your eyes. The edges of the circle disappear, and what is in it is no longer contained at all. The light expands and covers everything, extending to infinity forever shining and with no break or limit anywhere. Within it everything is joined in perfect continuity. Nor is it possible to imagine that anything could be outside, for there is nowhere that this light is not.\n\nThis is the vision of the Son of God, whom you know well. Here is the sight of him who knows his Father. Here is the memory of what you are; a part of this, with all of it within, and joined to all as surely as all is joined in you. Accept the vision that can show you this, and not the body. You know the ancient song, and know it well. Nothing will ever be as dear to you as is this ancient hymn of love the Son of God sings to his Father still.\n\nAnd now the blind can see, for that same song they sing in honor of their Creator gives praise to them as well. The blindness that they made will not withstand the memory of this song. And they will look upon the vision of the Son of God, remembering who he is they sing of. What is a miracle but this remembering? And who is there in whom this memory lies not? The light in one awakens it in all. And when you see it in your brother, you are remembering for everyone.\n\n\\~ Jesus the Christ \\~", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 64304, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "ACIM, Chapter 21, Introduction &amp; The Forgotten Song", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572228608, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dmja4v/acim_chapter_21_introduction_the_forgotten_song/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "NameOfSonOfMan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4h03fdkg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571936283, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dmj97j/the_song_of_144000/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dmj97j", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dmj97j/the_song_of_144000/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571936283, "score": 3, "selftext": " \n\nRev 14:1 And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount  \nSion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father\u2019s name written in their foreheads.  \nRev 14:2 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of  \nmany waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:  \nRev 14:3 And they sung as it were a new song before the  \nthrone, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.  \nRev 14:4 These are they which were not defiled with women;  \nfor they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb  \nwhithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the first fruits unto God and to the Lamb.  \nRev 14:5 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are  \nwithout fault before the throne of God.\n\nI wrote this in symbolic language nearly two thousand  \nyears ago. It sounds like the song will be sung by heavenly beings flying around the throne of God, but in reality anyone here on earth who recognizes the Spirit of God flowing through him is very close to the throne of God. It may sound like the song will be sung by virgin men but they will be both men and women who are pure in heart. Many have also thought the number 144,000 is a limiting number, but in reality it is the number of one great symbolic choir, one of many that will eventually come from this small planet. Also,  \nthe song will not be sung, in the ordinary sense, on the physical plane but by souls of aspiring disciples. It is to be spoken out loud and registered by the spirit within. When the words are registered by the soul a beautiful song is sent to God, and, in return, the seeker will receive spiritual protection and assistance.\n\n\\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  \n\u201cWe thank you Father that you have revealed to us your protective universal light; that within this light is complete protection from all destructive forces; that the Holy Spirit of Your Presence permeates us in this light, and wherever we will the light to descend.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe thank you Father that you fill us with your protective  \nfires of Love; that within this love is complete protection from all destructive thoughts and feelings; that the consciousness of Christ is lifted up in us in this love, and wherever we will the love to be enflamed.\u201d\n\n\"We thank you Father that you are in us and we are in you;  \nthat through us Your Will is sent forth on wings of power; that Your Purpose is accomplished on earth as it is in heaven; that through us Your Light and Love and Power is manifest to all the Sons and Daughters of Mankind.\"  \n\\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nYou, my friends, have just heard the Song of the 144,000 before the throne of God. There are already groups of 144,000 singing the song on the spiritual planes, but this is the beginning of the spiritual song upon the earth. Soon, it will be on earth as it is in heaven; and there will be 144,000 and more who will feel the Light and Love and Power of the Father-Mother God and allow themselves to be a note played within the music of the spheres.\n\nSay it together at least once a day and say it as an individual at least once a day. Each time you say it, however, visualize all those who can sing the song of the soul as if they were in your presence and enjoying the light and love and  \npower you have felt here tonight. As each new person learns the song the whole will be strengthened and energized.\n\nThe true singing of the Song of the 144,000 is accomplished  \non three levels: the physical, emotional and mental planes, which opens the door of the spiritual.\n\nIf a person merely memorizes the words and repeats them only on the physical plane, he is not truly singing the song. The vibrations of words only being uttered cause very little result. In addition to saying the words one must feel and think the words. In a sense you become the Word which is God. The final thing you must always do is to sing the song as if you are in the presence of all others who are also in the great choir. When you do this you open the door to the spiritual energy and become a true singer of the song; you not only help yourself, but you also assist all others who also know and use the song. There is a strong interplay and sharing of energy that is available to those who have the Father\u2019s name written in their foreheads.\n\nFrom a higher point of view there is not a lot of difference in  \nbeauty between speaking and singing. The beauty of the song of the soul far eclipses the most beautiful singing on the earth. Thus you will find some of the most spiritual people on the planet often do not have a good physical singing voice. This is because they have put so much attention on the inner beauty. On the other hand, there are a handful of spiritual people who have also cultivated a good singing voice, so you can\u2019t really judge the spiritual evolution of a person by the sound of his physical voice.\n\n(From the Book- The Immortal by J.J.

If you would like to schedule a session with me, please send me a private message h\nEre on Reddit with your first name, your approximate location (for better connection) and complete WhatsApp number INCLUDING the international dialing code (+) with your desired appointment time in GMT+3 (MY timezone), Google will help you figure out what the time will be in your timezone if you are unsure. \n\n*Due to the high number of requests I get, I unfortunately won't have enough time to reply to you if the above information is not included in your message as the message ping pong here on Reddit, shortens the amount of time I have with clients, so thanks for understanding. Small kind tips are also welcome \ud83d\ude0a\n\n\n\n\nDuring the session, I always advise my clients to lay down on their back in a comfortable position without any distractions in the room, you may want to switch off your phone etc. \nI also advise to listen to some Reiki music during the session to help you relax. I will send these to you via WhatsApp before we begin :)\n\n\n(LIVE) Available appointment times to choose from for both days (GMT+3) but I am available 24\\7 for normal paid booking as explained below and on my Etsy Shop website in my bio if you decide you would like to schedule a full session with me. \n\n\n12pm\n\n1pm\n\n2pm\n\n3pm\n\n4pm\n\n\nPlease also note that for normal paid sessions, I can \"time\" the Reiki for you to receive it at whatever time best suits you, for example if you live in Los Angeles and can not make one of these times and want to receive the Reiki at 10pm when you go to bed, I can time the Reiki for you to receive it then. In this case I will still send you a voice note as a report of the session after I have finished but I would highly recommend that you do not listen to it until you have receieved the session yourself at the time agreed upon, this will not distort any healing energies of course but other things might come up in your energy body that I may not be aware of if you first listen to thenreport and then recieve your Reiki. I will still send you the links to listen to the Reiki music for duri g the session. \n\nMost of my clients do prefer to receive \"live\" sessions, to receive at the same time I am sending but in my client's busy schedules, this is not always achievable everytime.\n\n\n\nMany thanks and have a great day \ud83d\ude0a\n\nLuke - ReikiVidya", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports":

dream for the second time in my life except this time it was even worse. Initially, (while still sort of awake) I heard a claw at my door. I sleep with my door closed and my cat claws at the door when he wants to come in to sleep and I open it for him and shut it back. I heard it this time, but it sounded kind of weird, but I still went to open it. He wasn\u2019t there so I thought nothing of it and went back to sleep. When I went back to sleep I felt like something was there with me and it didn\u2019t mean me well and while I was asleep, I wasn\u2019t really sleeping. The part of the dream that was recurring and really scared me was the part of it where I kept literally forcing myself awake and fighting as hard as I could through the sleep paralysis and going into my moms room to jump in her bed thinking it was finally over only to \u201cwake up\u201d again in my bed. It happened over and over and over again. It felt so real and that was the worst part about it. The last time the spirit was pulling my sheets over my head and telling me I wasn\u2019t going anywhere. I swear I thought this was real. I finally woke up and I thought, more than ever, that it was real this time. I ran into my moms room and started bawling my eyes out. I never  cry in front of my mom, but I felt safe and I couldn\u2019t stop the tears. I tried speaking through my anguish and I told her that I felt like \u201cthey\u201d was after me and it was my fault because I was questioning my religion and I didn\u2019t know what to do because I was so afraid. She was really calm (like my mother) and she looked like my mother, but now that I\u2019m awake I could tell the differences whereas I couldn\u2019t then. She said a lot more than I remember. The only thing I do remember is after I said what I said about questioning my religion she said \u201chmm you probably pissed off a lot of half-wits\u201d and I don\u2019t know why I felt so comforted by that statement. I was having a panic attack as if I were having it in real life as I often do and somehow I ended up unclothed and she was unclothed too and she was behind me and she just held me. She cupped my breasts like it was ritualistic and just held me. There was nothing weird about it and I trusted her completely. I felt her taking away my worries and fear. I was calm enough to actually wake up this time. I cried and cried. I just stopped crying actually. I\u2019m a little afraid, but I\u2019m not paralyzed with fear anymore. I feel calm.

I turn around and sit in a rolling computer chair behind me and as soon as I hit the chair, it becomes a different world.\nI didn't realize at the time, but all of a sudden I was put at my friends house, still sitting in my chair, and it was like i knew i was there and didn't realize that I was just at my house.. so I started to notice almost a different texture in the air, and I started questioning things, but I couldn't quite figure out what was wrong. So I got up and started asking my friends questions, but they'd never answer me. I found myself being ignored, so I sat back down, and just looked around for a minute starting the wonder what the hell is going on. That's when I start to look for my truck keys, and if you know me, they stay on me at all times, and I knew something was wrong. That's when I realized what just happened and got the overwhelming feeling that it wasn't real life.\nThat's when I started getting jumped in and out of a lot of different memories and places I've been and remember in my lifetime, deep places that I could never think of without that experience. It's almost like a deep journey through your mind and places that you've been. \nThe next thing that happened was I felt like I was shot up into space, and I knew it was my spirit, because I could still almost feel my body, but i couldn't, like I was in two places at once.. as if by whatever happened, I knew it was outside of my body at that time and my spirit was pulled from me. I started getting a bombardment of emotion at this time, every single emotion you can think of. It was like all my emotions were put on a roulette wheel and spun so that as each one passes, it hits you. Honestly it sounds kind of uneasy but it was an incredible feeling and it made you know that whatever this was, it was eternal, and spiritual. I was hearing music and envisioned this glowing light floating in space, it was almost pulling my spirit to it, as if I was orbiting this light. And before I knew it, I shot back into my body.\nAs soon as I hit my body, I started crying uncontrollably, the light was gone, and I was back at my house in the chair. Crying.

reflection on my life and who i am as a person, and i\u2019m realizing that i just care too much. about how i look, about small things i say to people, about things i do to and around people, about other people in general (if they\u2019re \u201cannoying\u201d, if they post something weird, etc.). i want to be more \u201cconnected\u201d with others i guess, just recognizing we are all people and just being more accepting to diversity and not caring about details about them. i just realize i overthink way too much about too many things that don\u2019t matter, and i don\u2019t focus on what i should: myself, the development of myself as a person, my health, studies, etc. i\u2019m so fucking invested at this point to expand on this mindset and i want to explore different \u201cspiritualities\u201d etc that just talk about being more carefree, stress free, focusing on the positives, thinking peacefully, being more accepting and open minded to others, etc. ignoring struggles in your life (relevant to me because i\u2019ve been battling chronically depression and severe general anxiety+social anxiety  for almost 5 months). i also want to read/listen about more up on going with the flow of like with a more \u201cit it is what it is; i don\u2019t like it, then i don\u2019t need to focus my energy on it\u201d type of idea. my whole life i\u2019ve been in such a negative dark mindset and i want to change. \n\nside note i guess, this weekend my boyfriend and i rolled together and we had the most meaningful, deep, genuine and passionate conversation together regarding how love and compassion for each other and how both of us have allowed each other to grow. we\u2019ve both faced hardships in our lives but we are both very sensitive and caring people and we want to grow, become better people, and spread positivity to our friends and loved ones around us.  i\u2019ve been dealing with a lot of shit lately and my boyfriend has stuck through it all... my breakdowns, when i let everything out o him, when i shut the world out including him, etc but his love and care for me has made me realized i am so lucky to have someone who still stays with me regardless of my problems, and that made me realize i need to change not just for him and the health of our relationship but for myself as well. i told him all of this, how indescribably greatful i am to have finally found a person in my life , for once, that i feel a genuine bond with, that i have never experienced otherwise in my family, my friendships, or romantic relationships. and how grateful i was that this person who i love with every ounce of my heart is sticking by my side in my self-growth and discovery process. we embraced each other crying and told each other we are growing together, here to support each other. this experienced clicked a serious switch in me, and i have NEVER felt a switch like this before. my desperation to grow my mind is here, it\u2019s now and i am ready. \n\nplease drop your recommended youtube videos, websites, books, and spiritualities you recommend i dive into. i genuinely believe that if i cure my plagued mindset, thought process and spirituality from past experiences and some of the evilness in humans today, i can defeat my anxiety and depression.  i know that i have problems but i\u2019m more than willing and capable of growing and developing as a person. i am ready. i can\u2019t wait to check out what you guys recommend :).", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit":

I felt myself detach from my ego and completely open up to him - in the sense that for those moments I could no longer identify with fear or insecurity; I finally allowed myself to just be. I\u2019ve never felt so at peace around someone, like I could be myself completely. I felt a sense of safety that I didn\u2019t know I could feel.

Told through the eyes of those born with the gift of communicating with the spirit world, this film shines a light on the lesser known facts about the afterlife. Born out of the need to confront fear associated with death, this film challenges the materialist perspective that there is nothing outside of this physical reality.\n\nMy aim with BTV is to provide an alternative view on death, which allows people who are grieving to reconnect with their loved ones and to provide those preparing to die with proof that there is life after death.\n\nAfter losing a loved one 5 years ago, I embarked on this journey of trying to find answers to these very questions. Three months after my mother\u2019s death, I saw a gifted psychic, one of the main characters in my documentary whose work along with other incredible teachers, has opened my eyes to a reality I never knew existed.

difficulty surrendering your plans and goals to the universe/God?!\n\nAll my life I\u2019ve felt I had to fight for survival as I am a victim of child sexual and emotional abuse. Since I saw myself as the only one looking out for me, I had to protect myself while living in fear by constantly micro managing, planning my next move, and rushing to get wanted. I had to become super controlling and self disciplined in order to remove toxic messages and people from my life. I also had to discipline myself in order to prevent addictive habits such as toxic relationships, binge eating, spending, binge drinking, ruminating and going back to old coping mechanism.\n\nI\u2019ve been reading about how people find success in life by giving up their  control and surrendering their plans/goals to the universe/God by trusting there is a far greater plan. They say it\u2019s best to live by your heart/ intuition, set an intention, and then let the universe unfold their plan organically. \n\nWhen I try to surrender, I feel myself resisting so much. When I do surrender for a moment, I do feel\nCalmer but I get scared and then go back to feeling in control. Perhaps I\u2019m self sabotaging.\n\nI\u2019m afraid if I start surrendering and letting go, I\u2019ll go back to old patterns and things will not go right for me. I\u2019m afraid of abusers and toxic people entering my life because I\u2019ll be so open like I used to (but I guess what is different now is I assert myself more and set boundaries). It\u2019s so hard for me to get out of my head and in my feelings and body. \n\nI also think it\u2019s hard for me to surrender as I am still exploring my faith in spirituality and don\u2019t know for sure if there is a higher power watching over me. I am moving towards having faith there is a higher power but I haven\u2019t fully accepted it yet.\n\nHas anyone been in my position before and any suggestions to surrender?

So merciless was I as I relentlessly hit myself to get to the bottom of whatever was inside me, yet I was not the right target for such rough handling.\n\nI was in reality so elegant, sensitive, gracious, and delicate. It turns out that while I had been descending down to the Earth, I had covered myself with multiple layers of drapes to protect this sensibility.\n\nEverything I assumed to be impure, flawed, or obstructive were, in fact, all just those layers of drapery I had created, so the *love* burning within me could adapt to this world. I wasn\u2019t aware of it at all, though.\n\nIf I had hit this planet with that much *love*, as it was, I would have been burned to ashes or driven insane, because my body simply was not ready for it.\n\nThe Creator\u2019s system is perfect, however, and it loves me so very much. It continued protecting me from myself on seeing that my self was not ready. It also spared me, because I did not know who I was. When I was furious with the Creator or insanely afraid, the Creator also played the role of protector and absolver, soothing me, yet I never realized it.\n\nMoreover, I had volunteered for this task long before coming to this world. I had said, \u201cI\u2019ll make this body you have bestowed upon me a reflection of *love*! With each layer of drapery uncovered, I will grow closer to the source. I will adjust with it, and I will live and reflect that *love* even stronger, over and over!\u201d\n\nAs I do this, not just my own body but also those of my children, my friends, and future generations will transform as well, step by step, into nests of *love*. This is how this world will become nothing other than pure *love*, from north to south and from east to west.\n\nThis is the truth behind the expression \u201cWhat you seek is inside you.\u201d We\u2019ve been seeking to become *love* and looking for *love*, here, there, and everywhere, yet that *love* was always burning inside us. We just need to gradually get used to it. And you, the owner of those beautiful eyes that gaze at these lines, are burning with the longing and desire of that *love*\u2014I know this. Just like I do too.\n\nBut do not assume that it\u2019s Hasan writing these lines, that he is the one filled with *love.* Hasan is merely a vehicle for *you*! You\u2019re looking at the page right now and these lines remind *you* of *yourself, b*ecause *you* made a promise to yourself, so this information flows to *you.* If you go deeper inside, you\u2019ll see Hasan is actually a part of your mind, and *you* are writing these words to *yourself.* It is what reflects from the eternal *love* burning inside you to your eyes, heart, mind, and body.\n\nYou are loved, very much indeed\u2026\n\n\u2026with such a *love*.\n\nDo you feel how much you are *loved*?\n\nDo you remember?\n\nDo you want to remember?\n\nDo you think it is time to feel that *love* and live the *love* you actually are?\n\nSo, turn your eyes inward now and open a little more of those drapes that hide your *love*\u2026\n\nYou\u2019ll then live it and know it, the *love* that has always been there\u2026.\n\n\u2026and always will be.\n\nIn flesh and blood, as if it was whispered in your ear.\n\nIn you, in your existence, in your being, in your womb, whatever\u00a0 you see, hear, smell, taste, touch, feel, or live\u2014it\u2019s just exactly there.\n\nYou are everything.\n\n*Love* is within you.\n\nLive with this truth always\u2026\n\n\u2026in love.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHasan Sonsuz Celiktas  \neditor@thewisemag.com  \nwww.thewisemag.com", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit":

One where evil voices constantly harass  one's mind.\nBut the truth is the inner deep imbalance that such a person experience is never going away. It is only being numbed down. Stop the medication and everything comes back right away. You can't never run away from it.\n\nI strongly believe everyone has their own angel and demon talking to them on each shoulders on a daily basis. Most people just don't realise the fight that's taking place inside of them. A fight that has been metaphorically been represented by all cultures around the world through all ages by evil.\n\nSo the question is...\n\nThe truth and existence of evil, is it all just taking place in our collective subconscious? Is it all just a very simple metaphor of the broken reality taking place in everyone of us?\n\nOr truly, is it true that evil and demonic spirits exist outside of us to a point where we can lose our minds and souls? Religion states that we are fighting against an evil spiritual power that wants to enslave us in delusions. I would tend to agree.\n\nIn the last 3 years I have been asking for truth. The one and only.\nAnd what I seem to have received is beyond anything I could ever have imagined.\nIf it is true that the Devil is real and that he can manipulate us in a path without the divine, without God...\n\nWhat does it mean for us who don't experience evil like schizophrenics do?

He doesnt love himself. He hates himself. He really doesnt like the core of who he is. He wont ever tell you that but I know that now and I know why.. it's a generational curse. His mother was abusive, and my great grandmother was too...do you see the pattern? I know they didnt love themselves... and I know that because I didnt love myself.. and the reason I didnt love myself is because I was holding onto their ancestral karma... because THEY are LITERALLY ME. AS ABOVE // SO BELOW Ohhhhh just got real deep. I've always struggled with self love and some emotional problems and didnt understand why. Especially the past few years after enduring abuse from my father. So here's how things have been going down for my healing process. Since going no contact and finally leaving my dads I've really struggled with healing myself... and this was a HUGE thing in my life. Everyday. This was not allowing me to love myself and I didnt realize the paradigm!! Whenever I thought of my dad (every day!) I would think I hate him.. I cant forgive him for how he treated me. It got increasingly worse especially up until recent times. I could not for the life of me figure out how to heal because I KNOW in order for me to heal I have to FORGIVE. Forgiveness is freedom. But I just really couldn't bring myself to forgive his actions, but I desperately needed the healing. How are you supposed to forgive someone who isnt even sorry?\nI realized recently.. it was becoming present in my mind that I hated this man so much that when I looked into my own being I saw him and couldnt love it. NOW PAUSE. SKRTT. And then that's when I realized.... let me say that again.. I could not love myself because I saw my dad in me... DO YOU GET IT? *HELL-O.* I couldnt LOVE myself because he is APART of me. LITERALLY. ON MANY LEVELS. and he didnt love himself along with his mother and so on! DOES IT RING YET? I couldn't do it because I am him. And he dont love his own self.\nI am 1/2. as above/so below. Does it ring? Please someone tell me they get me if they actually understand lol. \nAnyway... \nSo let's break this down.. \nI did some successful shadow work.\nWhat was I feeling? Resentment. Frustration. Betrayal. Anger. Sadness.\nAnd I asked why... and it's like my pen wrote autonomously..\nBecause he dont like himself\nAnd because he dont like himself\nI CARRY THAT.\nbecause I am 1/2. \n\nMy best friend was assisting me heal during this time.\nHe told me close my eyes and feel it out; Go into darkness.\nI ask \"until\"\nHe asked me what am I trying to go towards\nI say \"Freedom.\"\n\"And what is freedom to you?\"\n\"love.\"\n\"love from who? \"\n\"myself.\"\n\n....... so how do I forgive this man? \nI forgive this man... by loving myself. \n\nShit just rocked my whole world. When I realized that.... I freed myself. I just cried tears tears joy. I feel like this weight has been lifted. I can actually love myself now and when I see him I can love him too from my distance. I can look at a photo now of him or us and not be bitter. I have successfully broken the curse and healed my lineage. I feel pride and I know my ancestors are thanking me for healing them also. And I will continue to do so because that was so liberating.\nPeace and love to you all.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 64097, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I HEALED MYSELVES / ANCESTRAL KARMA", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572206171, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dlwrds/i_healed_myselves_ancestral_karma/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "3Dmatrix", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3yy7w5kn", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571821926, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dlwmk8/channelled_2nd_time_2nd_channeller_equally/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dlwmk8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Channeling"}], "link_flair_template_id": "fa02bd38-8418-11e7-839e-0ecd58f017ce", "link_flair_text": "Channeling", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dlwmk8/channelled_2nd_time_2nd_channeller_equally/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571821927, "score": 7, "selftext": "Hi everyone.

I feel that I am breaking free. I am starting to know me.  \n\n\nI thought - 1 channeller - Wow - Fantastic information. It resonates and is very accurate to me.  \nBut when the 2nd channeller told me the same things... I surrender and accept now that this is true.  \nThere is not a chance that 2 persons would say the exact same about me.   \n\n\nThis is propably my thought and manifestation which I desided to share with you seekers out there.

It helps if i know what gender you identify with so i know if a card is about you or someone in your life, but its not necessary.\n\nYou can use a throwaway email address if you don\u2019t feel comfortable giving a stranger your personal email which I totally understand. I will text you on Reddit to let you know when it\u2019s time to go pick up your reading at the alternate email.\n\nAll I ask in return is a commitment from you that you will give me (Hopefully detailed) feedback within 24 hours. And if you really liked the reading and would be open, I\u2019m collecting reviews for my website that I\u2019m building.\n\nIf you are picked, I'll let you know how long to expect before your reading.

It is, however, sometimes found that even demoniac persons who are envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, worshiping K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a different way, take to the profession of explaining Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in a different way to make business, but anyone who desires actually to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must avoid such commentaries on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.Actually the purpose of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is not understandable to those who are sensuous-even if one is not sensuous but is strictly following the disciplines enjoined in the Vedic scripture, if he is not a devotee, he also cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Even when one poses himself as a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but is not engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities, he also cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. There are many persons who envy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because He has explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that He is the Supreme and that nothing is above Him or equal to Him. There are many persons who are envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such persons should not be told of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, for they cannot understand. There is no possibility of faithless persons' understanding Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the authority of a pure devotee, one should not try to comment upon Bhagavad-git\u0101.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the characteristics of a person who cannot understand the Bhagavad-gita ?**\n\n[Picture : Bhagavad-gita 18.67](http://gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/67)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 64078, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 18.67", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572203687, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dlurvo/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1867/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "abhipeace", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4uggcqur", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571807733, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dluk6t/thought_of_the_day/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dluk6t", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dluk6t/thought_of_the_day/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571807736, "score": 11, "selftext": "\u201cWe are all here for some special reason.

illuminates all, who recreates all, from whom all proceed, to whom all must return, whom we invoke to direct our understandings right in our progress toward his holy seat. ~ Translation by philologist J. William (1807)\n\nThe Gayatri mantra (brahma-gayatri) carries great significance for followers of Indian religious traditions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. This is evident by the frequency in which the Gayatri is referred to in Vedic texts including Bhagavad Gita, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, and Savitri Upanishad. The eldest estimated inscription of the Gayatri is found in the Rig Veda. Strictly speaking, Gayatri is a form of Sun worship, but not the kind which we might like to imagine\u2014that they are attaching their \u2018fabricated\u2019, \u2018primitive\u2019 meanings onto our (or a modern scientific) idea of sun\u2014no; the Gayatri mantra is a ritual which brings the practitioner into alignment with their highest understanding of God, the Supreme Source of all life and energy.\n\nKept secret, its potency is said to be only unlocked when it is received through initiation from a genuine guru in an authorised line (samparadaya). Gayatri is said to empower the practitioner; giving heightened levels of knowledge, perspective, and confidence. It is even said to possess healing powers. In this journal, I put forward that the said results are achieved by virtue of the ritual connecting the practitioner, through the liminal, from the profane to the Sacred. \n\nVital to the efficacy of the Gayatri ritual is initiation. To receive the benefits of the Gayatri mantra, the student must receive the sacred mantra, along with the sacred thread, from a guru in the upanayana ceremony\u2014becoming twice-born (dvija). The sacred thread, which once received is never removed, sits on the body of the twice-born; wrapped around the neck, over the right shoulder, passing under the left arm, across the waste, returning up the chest to the neck. Traditionally, but not always, only those descending from either the priest (brahmana) or military/administrative (kshatriya) classes are eligible to receive Gayatri. Although, occasionally unorthodox schools have opened up the initiations to people born outside of those casts; including women and people born outside of India also.\n\nTo perform Gayatri correctly, a strict and elaborate procedure is given as follows. At the three junctions of the day\u2014sunrise, midday, and sunset\u2014after bathing, the practitioner adorns themselves in clean cloth and sits on a mat in the lotus yoga pose\u2014sitting cross-legged, back erect. Before reciting the Gayatri, to purify the body and mind, acaman is performed. Acaman is a purificatory process where mantras are invoked into a small pot of water using sacred hand gestures (mudras) and drops of that water are sprinkled on the different parts of the body. The yogi then touches parts of their face and body with mudras also. All of this is accompanied by the chanting of the prescribed mantras for each action. Then, the sacred thread is wrapped around the thumb of the right hand three times and held in that position while the yogi concentrates on the breath (pranayama) and recites the Gayatri mantra. \n\nMeditation on the sun rays while sitting on a lotus_all colours seen in light, lining up with the chakras\nMeditation on the sun rays while sitting on a lotus_all colours seen in light, lining up with the chakras\nThe Gayatri ritual is best performed in direct view of the sun, and preferably next to a body of water such as a riverbank, a lake, or the ocean. As the sun rises, sets, or passes through the highest point above the head, the practitioner follows the aforementioned procedure. The yogi meditates on the sound of each syllable as it vibrates the different energy-centres (cakras) of their physical and subtle body\u2014from the pelvic floor (muladhra-cakra) up to the crown of the head (svadhistana-cakra). Breathing in through the nostrils, the outward breath used only to vocalise the mantra, the yogi dissolves their identification with the profane by focusing on sacred sound vibration and, in doing so, awakens their spiritual identity in union with the Supreme God, Narayana, who is the source of the sun\u2019s energy.\n\nMeditating on the light from the sun, the ritual helps the chanter slip into a trance state. When light from the sun is observed in a relaxed, meditative state, it reveals the seven colours residing within it. These seven colours, the same colours which we see refracted in raindrops, causing a rainbow\u2014red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and purple\u2014have been mapped  by the yogis of yore, onto the seven energy-centres in the body; starting with red at the pelvic floor and ending with purple at the crown of the head.\n\nFurthermore, the syllables of the mantra each map onto the energy-centres within the body also, as well as the earthly and ethereal elements of the universe according to Vedic cosmology\u2014earth, water, fire, air, aether; body, mind, intelligence, ego; lower, middle, and higher, planetary realms; and the ultimate reality upholding everything. To get an experience of how this could work ourselves, we can slowly and deeply vocalise the syllables \u2018A-U-M\u2019 and notice how the syllable \u2018A\u2019 vibrates down into the pelvis, \u2018U\u2019 into the chest, and \u2018M\u2019 up into the penial gland.\n\nTo better capture the layered connections that I am describing, please refer to the table below. In terms of microcosm/macrocosm relationships, the Vedic traditions have mastered layer upon layer of fractal-like schemas that intertwine the individual with the Sacred hiding behind the profane in the world around them.\n\n\nAnthropological Analysis\n\nThe first critical requirement to practice Gayatri sun worship is the ritual of initiation. Initiation ushers an individual through different major transitional periods in their life. These phases between phases are known as the liminal. In the Vedic traditions, when a child transitions from childhood to adulthood, he approaches a guru and receives the sacred thread and mantras. This rite-of-passage puts the initiate in the liminal space, in between the dependency on the parents and the dependency on the universe itself. These liminal phases are when symbolism has the strongest impact on a person; making lasting impressions on a person\u2019s identity.\n\nNot only does the ritual of Gayatri take advantage of the once-off liminal transition into adulthood at the time of initiation, but it also utilises daily liminal phases for reaffirmation; the junctions of the day\u2014sunrise, midday, sunset. Even a layman can have a mystical experience during sunrise and sunset, what to speak of dedicated meditators, because they are simply awe-inspiring even to the hardest of materialists. This fact is revealed by the sheer number of modern-day sun worshipers who like to walk on the beach during sunrise and sunset, or, also, why we need to pay double for a house with an ocean view. These transitions of night into day, morning into evening, and evening into night again, are all the times of day when the liminal opens up, allowing a ritualist to invoke symbols in the process of reaffirming their connection to the Sacred.\n\nUndoubtedly, rhythm is of great importance in the performing of Gayatri. Layered into the void which opens up in the liminal, is rhythm. Within the ritual, we find rhythm upon rhythm: the rhythm of the repeating mantras, the rhythm of the syllables vibrating through the body from the pelvis to the top of the head, the rhythm of breath, the rhythm of the electromagnetic waves of light, the rhythm of the junctions of day, the rhythm of the days, seasons, years, and lifetimes. Through all these rhythms, the practitioner becomes; connecting to the greater world\u2014uniting the microcosm with the macrocosm\u2014by mediating on the given symbols which string the body, mind, and universe, together, for the individual, on the thread of that sacred sound vibration.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nGayatri takes advantage of the profane elements\u2014earth, water, fire, air, and ether, as well as the junctions of the day, and, through the use of sound vibration, mantra meditation, and yogic symbolism, the practitioner enters into union with the Sacred. Utilising these elements, the practitioner deconstructs themselves\u2014getting vision (dharsan) of all the parts that make up themselves and the world\u2014and then reconstruct themselves in line with the natural energetic principles of the universe. Performance of the Gayatri ritual is to take advantage of the daily waves of the liminal, to purify and rebuild the self, continually, starting from the earth and ending in the sky. This constant rooting to the ground and reaching for the sky\u2014the sacred\u2014is beautifully represented by the image of the Hindu god, Brahma\u2014who represents spiritual intelligence and creativity\u2014sitting atop of a lotus sprouting up from the cosmic causal ocean, out of the navel of the supreme deity, Vishnu. This process empowers the individual; gaining them detachment, understanding, peace, well-being, insight, confidence, bliss and fearlessness. A beautiful meditation is the Gayatri. One can imagine what it might be like to practice brahma-gayatri by considering that that same Sun, which you would have just had a profound religious experience with in the early morning, follows you throughout the day; and the moon reflects that same Sun at night too.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 64041, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Self actuation through sun worship", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572201190, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dls5gm/self_actuation_through_sun_worship/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bbbbabbyyyyg", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4j04ran9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571792252, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dlrn9g/how_do_you_go_from_worshipping_a_god_every_waking/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dlrn9g", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dlrn9g/how_do_you_go_from_worshipping_a_god_every_waking/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571792255, "score": 5, "selftext": "Is God testing me?

And no, I'm not just having a bad event and letting it spiral. In order to build a larger theory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the mentality: I'm stupidly optimistic. If anything, I'm too optimistic. I've tried everything to avoid coming to this conclusion &amp; tried to deny it 100x (&amp; still don't really believe it) but it's like if there's a higher power they are beating me over the head with this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLesson-learning: I've engaged in more self growth and come to so many \"realizations\" the last few years and none seem to mean anything bc then I just get punched trying to dodge the right I \"realized\". I can have everything in life seemingly well and maintained and I still just get pounded on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's go into the series of events that have led me here. I feel like this likely started in 2018. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn that span of time:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I found out my best friend and roommate had always been trying to smash all my past girlfriends\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-  I graduated and was basically unable to find a job with my degree\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The job I eventually did get was a small business that stalled and eventually basically stiffed me of a months work of 60 hr weeks. ( I know, go to your board of labor, blah blah blah but I was broke living on savings waiting for pay at this new job.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I've probably slowly drained an incredibly large social circle to scraps, to thinking I had nothing, to actually having nothing. Like not just 4-5 but my entire social circle has moved away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I have no family. I do, but they grew up w/o me and have their own lives. It's really more of a title. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- My girlfriend at the time (Lets say Girlfriend 1) had always suffered from depression and tried to kill her self. For months, I sent her gifts and whatnot, told her how wonderful she is as she cried and begged me not to give up on her. Well she went down on a visit to her old college, hooked up with a new dude and basically ghosted me and stole my kayak. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Girlfriend 2 was my longtime college girlfriend and I was honestly always pretty sure she was my soulmate. When the 1st relationship ended I flirted around with her as she was seemingly ending her old relationship. Just as ours was starting again, she discovered she was pregnant. I just recently watched the love of my life give birth to a baby boy that's I've mentally agonized over for months that's not mine. They get married in May.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I got smoked by a crackhead in a hit and run\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The car that I was always proud of got broken into, then died on me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- My replacement car constantly randomly dies on me at bad times despite service checkups that say it's fine\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- My best friend got laid off on my birthday and I spent the entire day comforting him. Almost nobody remembered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Always been a lucid dreamer but my dreams are almost worse than being awake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Napped for 14 HOURS for no reason the day of an exam, basically missing it. I had a regular sleep schedule all week and was barely tired. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I had a weird problem with canceling insurance where I missed an email and unknowingly built up debt on dual policies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I moved into an apartment the size of a shoebox\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Went back to school after getting guidance then found out employers don't care about degree recommended. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly I could go on for hours, you get the point. I've tried meditation, I've tried talking about things, tried throwing myself 110% into self improvement (Literally jacked with a 4.0 and my life BLOWS), tried asking for a purpose, tried praying, tried chilling with friends 24/7, being a loner, tarot, conducted root cause analysis' just talking to the universe, karma, apologizing for past wrongs, you name it, I've done it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm honestly only here out of a deep desperation to stop this.

For many years I woke up in complete chaos, but now I wake up relaxed and focused. The two things I do are simple, yet extremely effective.\n\nI've made a video if you'd like to learn how to start the day off right: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNPf-7UlJ0w\n\nIf you prefer reading:\n\n80% of us are doing something first thing in the morning that is RUINING the rest of the day. Can you guess what it is?\n\nWe check our phones first thing in the morning! And though it may seem harmless, I\u2019ll tell you why I\u2019ve decided to LOSE THE PHONE in the morning.\n\nSo, when we first wake up most of us, roll over, and before even getting out of bed we reach towards the night stand grab our phone\u2014and we check what\u2019s happening on social media. When we do this,\n\nWe run the risk the of becoming frustrated, annoyed, angry, or stressed because our newsfeed MAY be:\n\n\u2022 Filled with pictures of everyone\u2019s perfect little lives and our brain could start subconsciously comparing ourselves against them. OR \u2022 We\u2019ve got sponsored ads trying to sell us something. OR \u2022 We can news that is completely negative and it gets you riled up.\n\nAnd Then we could start reading emails and messages from people who are wanting us to do different things for them.\n\nAnd our mind starts the day off in complete chaos. It\u2019s in reactive mode, right? Before even getting out of bed, we can start the day off in a negative mindset. You wouldn\u2019t happily let 70 people walk into your bedroom when you first wake up, right? So why are we letting them into our lives first thing in the morning on our phone?\n\nWe give our energy and attention all day long to other people, so the least we can do is not give away our energy first thing in the morning.\n\nAnd I was guilty this for such a long time..but Now, what I like to do instead, is start the day by being proactive, so that I\u2019m in control. Instead of starting the day being reactive and letting all of these things consume me.\n\nSo, before touching the phone, I spend at least 15-30 minutes working on what I want to do, whether that\u2019s writing, reading, going for a walk, listening to music, \u2026whatever it is.\n\nSince, I\u2019ve adopted this new habit, I noticed that I\u2019m not as distracted during the day. I\u2019m a lot more calm. I start the day off being productive which carries on to the afternoon. And for once, I\u2019m excited to start the morning, instead of dreading it, because I\u2019m working on what I want to do which ends up boosting my mood and energy for the day.\n\nLosing the phone first thing in the morning has been a game changer in my life! And I highly highly recommend it if your life feels a bit stressful and chaotic right now.\n\nThe second self love habit that has changed my life in the morning is when I decided to STOP HITTING SNOOZE.\n\nSo when your alarm goes off and you hit the snooze and you start dozing off again scientific research shows that you trick your body into thinking its going back into a deep sleep. So, when you wake up again after only snoozing for 5, 10, 15 minutes, your brain and body are confused\u2026which leads to that groggy feeling you get that lasts for the rest of the day. Have you ever had that? It\u2019s called sleep inertia. And it is a BIG energy drainer.\n\nAnd when you\u2019re used to pressing snooze every single day when the alarm goes off, then you\u2019re body starts to form a habit\u2026so we can hit that snooze without even thinking twice about it.\n\nAgain..this was another bad habit of mine.\n\nSo, what I\u2019ve done to help break the habit is I\u2019ve changed the alarm sound, because the alarm sound acted as a trigger for me to roll over and turn the snooze on.\n\nSo, when I picked a new alarm sound, then that formed a new trigger, so that I could create a new habit to wake up more positive.\n\nAnd the amazing new habit that I\u2019ve implemented is naming 3 things that I\u2019m grateful for.\n\nSo, now when I hear my new alarm sound, that is my new trigger to turn OFF the alarm and instantly name 3 reasons for why I\u2019m grateful. This starts my day off right BECAUSE when I think of why I\u2019m grateful, it puts me into a positive mindset, my mood is instantly lifted, and I\u2019m more in a state of abundance rather than feeling like I\u2019m lacking something.\n\nIf you want to take this tip to the next level, then you could put your phone somewhere where you cant reach it\u2026like across the room or completely outside of the room. This forces you to get up to turn off the alarm, and it breaks that bad habit of reaching over for the phone without thinking.\n\nThere\u2019s also around 30% of people who check their phone throughout the night, so having that thing away from you will help you not only wake up better but also sleep better.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 64026, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How to Wake Up in a GOOD Mood! \u2600\ufe0f", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572199993, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dlqw4w/how_to_wake_up_in_a_good_mood/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "livelifenotmind", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3qjriken", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571788439, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dlqugf/two_questions_i_try_and_ask_myself_most_frequently/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dlqugf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General"}], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dlqugf/two_questions_i_try_and_ask_myself_most_frequently/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571788442, "score": 6, "selftext": "1.

Do you know who you are fundamentally?\n\nAt your core, you are peace. Our fundamental nature is peace. Yes, every human being on Earth is peace at their core. I realize it\u2019s difficult to accept because a lot of people are anything but peace, but it is true, we are fundamentally peace.\n\nI share two examples in the video to make the point.\n\nThis mantra, \u201cI am peace,\u201d can change your life! \n\nRemember, all the problems, challenges and disappointments you might face are all external to you. Internally, you are peace, you can only be peace.\n\nWhenever you are in a difficult situation, recite to yourself, \u201cI am peace. I am peace. I am peace.\u2026\u201d Even though your conscious mind might say, this seems simple or even ridiculous, your sub-conscious will take the cue from your recitals and begin to feel a little more peaceful. If you recite it enough times it will \u2013 you have to try it.\n\nI humbly share the below video with you. It starts off slowly, but please stay with it, it builds to a peaceful crescendo. \n\n\u201cAt your core, you are peace. Be who you are.

So a few weeks ago did my level 2 class in reiki and been self applying ever since...\n\nYesterday I self applied and sent reiki to some loved ones and as always but i guess more intensely, my heart was filled with love.. an imense joy and oneness with the world, just filled me and it moved me in a way i was in tears...\n\nWent to sleep really happy and peaceful thinking i would have a wonderful nights sleep...\n\nHad THE WORST nightmare ever! I have VERY vivid dreams (and nightmares) usually so they always give me a bit of anxiety of not being able to differentiate between the dream and reality, but today i had a nightmare that was very graphic!! Hardcore gore, mutilated corpses, guts hanging out, I even closed my eyes in disgust inside the dream! That\u2019s how horrible the imagery was! And then I was up those stairs, on what it looked like an abandoned building, i was with someone that in the dream felt like someone i new... he then showed me these \u201cmonsters\u201d he had created, out of bones and pieces that were ultimately designed to kill. My heart sank, i cried and screamed and tried running away because i knew the person wanted to kill me... but he grabbed me by the foot, my nails sinking into the floor trying to escape while he dragged me... i never felt so afraid, so desperate, genuine fear and terror. \n\nWoke up paralyzed, crying, sweating, I couldn\u2019t believe how this had happened since I went to sleep with such high energy, love, all good feelings...\n\nSo i wanted some clarity, has anyone ever experienced this? Is this normal? I asked my higher being some questions, could the nightmare have the answer somehow? Is it more than a dream? \n\nI feel lost and wanted to read some of your thoughts on this...", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 63962, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Vivid nightmare after self applying reiki", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572193851, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dlkkwt/vivid_nightmare_after_self_applying_reiki/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ohyou98", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_mrndxdx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571761271, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dlk97y/ive_been_feeling_so_damn_good_and_happy_lately/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dlk97y", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dlk97y/ive_been_feeling_so_damn_good_and_happy_lately/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571761272, "score": 2, "selftext": "LOVE YOU ALL, ANGELES! \u2764\ufe0f Smile today!

Everything seems to be for life...\n\nOf course the argument is that we are just byproducts of matter, but let us think about the future a bit, and there comes things like augmented reality and people are able to be in a world where dragons fly in the sky promoting sushi and they are soon in town squares there will be U.F.O.'s landing (not the aliens) and people can shoot them together with plastic laser guns.\n\nI could write about the future for ages, but the point is that if the reality don't have any kind of meaning upon life then why can we venture forward? Can mankind's journey to reach the space be simply a fluke of luck? But if you start to ponder the concept then there comes even strange little insight which is that if the reality is able to make mankind progress to 5G, nuclear plants, etc. then why couldn't there be the continuation of life as \"understood\" as our progress forth? And more we progress the more it seems that it's not just a fluke of luck?\n\n2.) Consciousness...\n\nOf course the common argument by many is that consciousness is simply emergent property of the brain, it doesn't have any kind of meaning, the universe is about physicality and consciousness is an illusion. BUT it's not the complete answer because still consciousness experience feels of being something. I usually take when I'm feeling of dying the concept that if I put a third person view upon myself, that this is an offspring of something more then consciousness could be seen as an esoteric ball or the whole human being could be seen as a soul. It's like you take another layer of reality which looks upon this world. But of course the issue could be more complex, but I don't know can consciousness be explained simply by accepting that this is all that exists.\n\n3.) Psychedelics...\n\nOkay, I said psychedelics, but for me it's strange that people see cartoon-like experiences, etc. in psychedelics. I've also seen the all-seeing eye of God and felt the ego death where I'm just a tool for the universe, the reality, etc., the feeling that there only exists the bigger picture. Of course there could be just death, but I'm such a loonie that I sometimes have difficulties to think that the reality is just a cartoon-like \"snuff\" movie, and the concept even goes back to 1.) because how could such things exist? How can we even see in our minds such concepts with the universe, etc. being just a fluke of luck without meaning, and yeah! I understand the naturalist point of view, that this is the only way how anything can exist, but the naturalist point of view could also have the concept that it could be more than all of this.\n\n4.) Reality has to only make logic upon itself..\n\nI could have written more these concepts like is anything truly random or is everything a path, but I thought to end this with the simple concept that reality only has to make logic upon itself, and in my point of view a person can put God, Absolute, Krishna, Brahman, Adi-Buddha, etc. as what all of this IS. Of course some think that it's just dead cold space without meaning, but what if it isn't? And the honest truth is that the reality just has to make logic upon itself.\n\n\\----\n\nSo, you see? I drink alcohol now and then. I'm not a drunkie of sorts, but I'm quite old and the hangovers can be a bit much and they take me to the side of nihilist, but then I just ponder couple of things and understand that I can't truly know if life continues or not. I don't know what IS the reality. I know that scientists go with the concept that only scientific results can be used as evidence, but I hardly think that they couldn't even know the answers upon the questions which I wrote.

I recently created a video of a very powerful visualization technique that I use to help you let go of a loved one. If you are anything like me, you also struggle with letting go. A few months ago I met an individual who I had more feelings for than ever imaginable. I wont go to deep into it but my attachment style hovers between an anxious attachment in relationships and an advoidant when I am dating. However this attraction was so much deeper and different. I fell head over heals in a very short time span but unfortunately for me the feelings were not entirely reciprocated. This caused a lot of pain and hurt in me. She told me that she felt like a bird and she was trapped in my hand. So I decided to use this exact feeling into a visualization technique to learn how to let go of her and live my own life. This can be used for loved ones, ex lovers, family or friends that unfortunately need to grow on their own before they are ready and willing to accept your love. I hope that this technique can help you as much as it helped me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://youtu.be/zJ2YlnbhzJ4](https://youtu.be/zJ2YlnbhzJ4)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 63943, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Letting go of a loved one", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572192037, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dliw00/letting_go_of_a_loved_one/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "WritingTherapy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_chad4xu", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571754969, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dlisma/thinking_youre_special_and_different_from_the/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 1}, "id": "dlisma", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General"}], "link_flair_template_id": "b926e2da-88c8-11e7-bb5f-0eb9d05233ea", "link_flair_text": "General", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 130, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dlisma/thinking_youre_special_and_different_from_the/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571754988, "score": 240, "selftext": "I'm seeing a lot of that here lately.

Do not fear.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe Lord has described various kinds of knowledge, processes of religion, knowledge of the Supreme Brahman, knowledge of the Supersoul, knowledge of the different types of orders and statuses of social life, knowledge of the renounced order of life, knowledge of nonattachment, sense and mind control, meditation, etc. He has described in so many ways different types of religion. Now, in summarizing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101,the Lord says that Arjuna should give up all the processes that have been explained to him; he should simply surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That surrender will save him from all kinds of sinful reactions, for the Lord personally promises to protect him.\n\nIn the Eighth Chapter it was said that only one who has become free from all sinful reactions can take to the worship of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus one may think that unless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to the surrendering process. To such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free from all sinful reactions, simply by the process of surrendering to \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he is automatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from sinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme savior of all living entities. With faith and love, one should surrender unto Him.\n\nAccording to the devotional process, one should simply accept such religious principles that will lead ultimately to the devotional service of the Lord. One may perform a particular occupational duty according to his position in the social order, but if by executing his duty one does not come to the point of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all his activities are in vain.\n\nAnything that does not lead to the perfectional stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be avoided. One should be confident that in all circumstances K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will protect him from all difficulties. There is no need of thinking how one should keep the body and soul together. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will see to that. One should always think himself helpless and should consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the only basis for his progress in life. As soon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the Lord in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, at once he becomes freed from all contamination of material nature. There are different processes of religion and purificatory processes by cultivation of knowledge, meditation in the mysticyoga system, etc., but one who surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not have to execute so many methods. That simple surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will save him from unnecessarily wasting time. One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all sinful reaction.\n\nOne should be attracted by the beautiful vision of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. His name is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because He is all-attractive. One who becomes attracted by the beautiful, all-powerful, omnipotent vision of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is fortunate. There are different kinds of transcendentalists-some of them are attached to the impersonal Brahman vision, some of them are attracted by the Supersoul feature, etc., but one who is attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, above all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, is the most perfect transcendentalist. In other words, devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in full consciousness, is the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is the essence of the whole Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Karma-yog\u012bs, empiric philosophers, mystics, and devotees are all called transcendentalists, but one who is a pure devotee is the best of all. The particular words used here, m\u0101 \u015buca\u1e25, \"Don't fear, don't hesitate, don't worry,\" are very significant. One may be perplexed as to how one can give up all kinds of religious forms and simply surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but such worry is useless.\n\n**Question 1 : Who is the most perfect transcendentalist ? What is the significance of the words : m\u0101 \u015buca\u1e25 ?**\n\n**Question 2 : What are the different religious processes mentioned in this verse ? What is their aim ? How one can get the benefits of all of them at once ?**\n\n[Picture : Bhagavad-gita 18.66](http://gloriousgita.com/verse/en/18/66)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 63906, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 18.66", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572189108, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dlg79b/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_1866/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "thinkingcrimes", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2905rztk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571740441, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dlg0vu/freedom_exists_in_balance/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dlg0vu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dlg0vu/freedom_exists_in_balance/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571740441, "score": 1, "selftext": "The light would cease to be a distinguishable presence without the existence of dark.

If you know anything about dimensions then the easiest way to put it is that I have mastery over the fourth and have developed pretty far into the fifth.

So with that said I don't really need external help on my journey, everything is always around you. Although recently I begun a relationship of sorts, and i've found it semi-difficult with how much higher I perceive... When it started she really had me down at her level, made me very \"human\" again so-to-speak, but now I am back at my mountain top of perception. It gets hard, our small talk is very different. It just feels like talking to a child in comparison, does anybody know what I mean? Somebody who is still very much in the dark. Of course she could get to where I am, as all can, but that just means i'd be right there helping her down the same treacherous journey I went through. Essentially doing it all over. Like I said everything is always there, I just seem to be like, blinded by my emotion.

Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The\u00a0EMTs\u00a0tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when you met me.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what happened?\u201d You asked. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou died,\u201d I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words.\n\n\u201cThere was a\u2026 a truck and it was skidding\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYup,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I died?\u201d\n\n\u201cYup. But don\u2019t feel bad about it. Everyone dies,\u201d I said.\n\nYou looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d You asked. \u201cIs this the afterlife?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cAre you god?\u201d You asked.\n\n\u201cYup,\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019m God.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy kids\u2026 my wife,\u201d you said.\n\n\u201cWhat about them?\u201d\n\n\u201cWill they be all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I like to see,\u201d I said. \u201cYou just died and your main concern is for your family. That\u2019s good stuff right there.\u201d\n\nYou looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn\u2019t look like God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn\u2019t have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it\u2019s any consolation, she\u2019ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d you said. \u201cSo what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be reincarnated.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d you said. \u201cSo the Hindus were right,\u201d\n\n\u201cAll religions are right in their own way,\u201d I said. \u201cWalk with me.\u201d\n\nYou followed along as we strode through the void. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n\n\u201cNowhere in particular,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just nice to walk while we talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the point, then?\u201d You asked. \u201cWhen I get reborn, I\u2019ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot so!\u201d I said. \u201cYou have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don\u2019t remember them right now.\u201d\n\nI stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. \u201cYour soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It\u2019s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it\u2019s hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you\u2019ve gained all the experiences it had.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven\u2019t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you\u2019d start remembering everything. But there\u2019s no point to doing that between each life.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many times have I been reincarnated, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.\u201d I said. \u201cThis time around, you\u2019ll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d You stammered. \u201cYou\u2019re sending me back in time?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you come from?\u201d You said.\n\n\u201cOh sure,\u201d I explained \u201cI come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you\u2019ll want to know what it\u2019s like there, but honestly you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d you said, a little let down. \u201cBut wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don\u2019t even know it\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the point of it all?\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d I asked. \u201cSeriously? You\u2019re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn\u2019t that a little stereotypical?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a reasonable question,\u201d you persisted.\n\nI looked you in the eye. \u201cThe meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean mankind? You want us to mature?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust me?

I don\u2019t want to use and believe in him in a selfish manner, I want to TRY and believe in him again , and see where it takes me. (I would appreciate if you read the whole post since I vented and I want people to listen to me and really think about what I\u2019m saying). Thank you. \n\nAs the title states, I\u2019m at a very pivotal point in my life right now, a very important one. I have shitted on God this past year when the years before this one, I still didn\u2019t believe in him but I didn\u2019t insult him... just in case... well.. you know. But I have insulted it/him because I have asked for signs from him and never received anything... I\u2019ve felt suicidal this year when I never really ever felt that way.. and I asked for him to help me and I didn\u2019t get anything, I didn\u2019t hear him or talk to him or see him near me. \n\nI\u2019m an intelligent person and I have realised if God existed he would not be offended at my words because.. well... I am him and he is me. He understands me better than I do myself, if he is real. He understands my mindset and my anxiety and my depression and my worries and my anger to him... because he is me. Punishing me because of my (a quite temporary one) mindset would mean him punishing himself. He is me. Therefore he knows I\u2019m a good loving caring person if you are like such to me, and if he exists he knows this about me. I know he would not punish me and I\u2019ve never really been worried lately about something like that since I realised this very important idea. The fact he is me, so he understands me, he knows there\u2019s no evil in my mind right now, and he knows my future and my past and my present, and the same goes for everybody else on this earth. \n\nIf he exists I guarantee to myself he won\u2019t punish anybody, even somebody like Hitler, because we all have good and bad inside of us. Hitler had a wife, he cared about somebody, he probably loved her too. God would understand Hitler\u2019s mindset as well, this universe is subjective to each of us and we are influenced by people every single day and most people don\u2019t notice, but they do... influences change our mindsets and our lifestyles. And I could bring the idea of multiple lives and having to experience a lot of them in order for our souls to progress and become wiser, therefore having to live throughout different people in different lifetimes and different mindsets from different cultural backgrounds and different beliefs - which is so crucial in understanding every person on Earth and why they operate the way they operate. Anyway, I just wanted to rant for a bit and get that shit out my mind. That was one topic. \n\nThe one I had in mind before creating this post was if I should TRY and believe in God again. I\u2019ve experimented with what my mindset would be like if I did believe in him or tried to.. and the mindset gives me so much confidence, it makes me fearless to every single person I encounter, it makes me even more intelligent, I think clearer and better overall, i don\u2019t have as much brain fog anymore. But deep down I know this is probably a strong placebo. My family is somewhat Christian and they have been since I was little and they haven\u2019t pushed anything upon me, they taught me a lot of good things and to formulate my own beliefs, ideas, and opinions about everything, and to not be a sheep and follow everything everybody else does, and I\u2019m grateful for that, because that external INFLUENCE (which I talked about) played I think a big part in shaping my personality today. I\u2019m so fucking socially anxious every day and I get intimidated by everybody so easily.. even if in public I\u2019m extremely good at hiding it. I have such low self esteem and thinking about my beloved caring God gives me beauty in my life, I tune into the mindset (every time I think about God) to the one I had when I was little and believed in him, I\u2019m talking single digit age. Because I always felt so happy and safe believing in god when I was little. Nothing scared me, I glowed, I was bubbly, charismatic and popular wherever I went because of my confidence and \u2018knowing\u2019 there was someone watching over me and there would be nothing and nobody to be afraid of. \n\nNow I\u2019m older (17M) and I\u2019ve become way more intelligent (obviously) and I know the dangers of falling into a delusion, I\u2019ve experienced delusions in the past few years like delusions of reference. But that\u2019s the thing, I don\u2019t want it to be a delusion. It would be difficult for somebody to know that they are being delusional and fall into it knowing all along they are delusional, but for me it\u2019s not difficult at all. So that\u2019s a trap for me, I have to try and make myself believe in a God, to have faith, I know the traps of delusions. I could believe something was a delusion and still believe in it, pushing the thought of it being a delusion to the back of my head and live my life by tuning my vibration and frequency to my then-transformed belief system. Very similar to how the law of attraction works. But anyways I don\u2019t want to be selfish and believe in god just to get me through this difficult time, that\u2019s not right, that\u2019d be using him and I don\u2019t want to use him in that manner, selfishly, I want to try and believe and open my heart to him. I have a lot of sins which are nowhere bad as other people\u2019s, im a good, funny, loving and caring guy but my sins are as little as smoking cigarettes, swearing, and judging people silently (which I have my reasons for). And I won\u2019t try and change anything like that if I feel it\u2019s not necessary, because like I said previously, God would understand me completely, he is me and I am him. He would not judge me, because he would be judging himself. \n\nThis was a massive fucking long read and I appreciate it if you read everything, I believe I have some thought provoking ideas and I needed to write a lot to vent and get this stuff off my mind.

If this would have happened to just one of us I would say it was the acid but were both 100% on the same page about what happened.\n\nWe were out on the balcony and looking at the sky, a good of time went by and we both looked visibly anxious and stressed. We talked about what was happening and we had both gotten lost staring at the moon - we were experiencing a pulling sensation in our chests, it truly felt like I was losing my self and sense of reality to the moon, it felt like it was staring in to my soul and held great power of us. It had an evil feeling to it, something I've never felt before. It was truly the most out of the norm, overwhelming thing I've ever experienced, but in a sense it seems like it was needed. This morning I woke up and for the first time truly acknowledged the evil that exists in the world and the light that we are here to be. I want to fully open my third eye, spread love to everyone. We are so small in this universe and something greater than us truly exists. I feel as if this was a big spiritual awakening moment for me, I feel more drawn to this side of myself and feel determined to be positive in this world.

Sometimes that pain strikes right through your heart, and you know those days very well. Sometimes it feels like you\u2019re being pulled apart limb by limb. But the most difficult one to bear is when you burn to ashes in flames. You know all these things all too well, as I do.\n\nI admire your courage, though, for not running away at times like these and numbing yourself with drugs, alcohol, or meaningless sex, choosing instead to stay in that pain. You know deep inside that this suffering must pass. Every deception you assume to be true and every illusion you suppose is real must be burned down. You know this, and that\u2019s exactly why you allow yourself to suffer!\n\nIt\u2019s because you have burned up before, many times in fact! It hurt so much, just like it does now, as if your guts are being ripped out. Sometimes this fire lasts more than a day, but you know it will pass sooner or later. You\u2019ve seen that only truth, essence, and what really exists can remain. I call it diamond, while you call it light. Wrapped up in deceptions that you supposed to be true: What was actually burned up was merely that, the you that you believed to be you. When you wake up the next morning, all that\u2019s left is what I call diamond and you call light. It is a light under the blue skies as bright as the warm sun, something you\u2019ve always waited for, the radiance that you always longed for\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s why you allow yourself to suffer and burn. You stay put, no matter how much it hurts, although you think it\u2019s you that\u2019s hurting\u2026\n\nDear soul, if on reading these lines you realize you are suffering relentlessly, know that you are not alone. This one here burns up, too. But hallelujah! This will surely pass, and you will be left with the brilliant truth. All it takes is to stay put in the fire. Don\u2019t postpone it! Don\u2019t deny it! Don\u2019t try to numb it! Don\u2019t escape it!  \n\n\nHasan Sonsuz Celiktas  \neditor@thewisemag.com  \nwww.thewisemag.com", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 63784, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I Know It Hurts a Lot", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572178220, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dl4sgh/i_know_it_hurts_a_lot/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TheWiseMag", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_pxxabt4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571680999, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dl4cee/i_know_it_hurts_a_lot/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dl4cee", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dl4cee/i_know_it_hurts_a_lot/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571681000, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 63777, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "I Know It Hurts a Lot", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572177710, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dl4cee/i_know_it_hurts_a_lot/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "true-freedom-net", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1msa4uk4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571680627, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dl4972/unfolding_the_dream_some_guidance/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dl4972", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dl4972/unfolding_the_dream_some_guidance/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "-zPtU7Y8SWZyup7U1pught6yv_mmP5kVydSgMJSaV4c", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/15ccgXKPBqqeTbPATOO3yWN101yzj1juwVTh9iGbS2w.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b02052339532f41e030bdea36708c4b170940228", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/15ccgXKPBqqeTbPATOO3yWN101yzj1juwVTh9iGbS2w.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54cd04b491613bf6576373902750cb8612bbfbdd", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/15ccgXKPBqqeTbPATOO3yWN101yzj1juwVTh9iGbS2w.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9981f56bf628275d0f4bc48674e8a024b42a2c7f", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/15ccgXKPBqqeTbPATOO3yWN101yzj1juwVTh9iGbS2w.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d0feef494457f383273a319ebfb6a251ff14b181", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1571680628, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hello, beautiful people!\n\nIn this video, I answer a series of questions from an awakened practitioner related to the process of unfolding the dream, and the suffering and anguish which follow the initial glimpse into the true nature of things.\n\nI thought I would share this guidance with you.

I found a small nail-sized hole that a towel rack used to hang from. That\u2019s it. That has to be it. I squinted my eyes, and tried to see through to the room next door, with no luck.\u00a0 I furiously grabbed what was left of my q-tips, stuffing them in the hole, and consequently made the hole larger in an attempt to block their view into my room. Ahhh.\u00a0 There we go.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cStupid bitch, we can still see you. Fuckin' tweaker.\u201d\n\nI yelled back, as loud as I could, \u201cYOU KNOW, WHAT YOU\u2019RE DOING IS ILLEGAL. YOU CANT VIDEO RECORD ME WITHOUT MY CONSENT. I PAID FOR THIS ROOM. YOU\u2019RE INFRINGING ON MY RIGHT TO PRIVACY.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at this bitch, trying to sound smart\u2026\u201d\n\nHours go by, with me and the woman next door screaming back and fourth at each other through the wall. At one point, I remember hearing the word \u201ccops\u201d, and peeking out the peephole, to see what I believed was someone in a POLICE vest standing outside my door.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s gotta come out sometime.\u00a0 I\u2019ll stand here all night.\u201d A male voice scoffed.\n\nOh my God. No. Not like this. I hurriedly shut my music off and began hiding the hundreds of used needles that were littering my room. I was sure to be careful of where I hid them, however.\u00a0 One of my neighbors in the hotel just went to jail because a house keeper got poked by a needle hidden in his mattress. Okay. Paraphernalia is picked up. Now for the meth. There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m going down for that. I ran to the bathroom, and waited right by the toilet. When SWAT breaks in, I\u2019m gonna flush it. But not until the door comes down. That\u2019ll show them. What drugs? I\u2019m a diabetic, that\u2019s why I have the syringes. You\u2019ve got the wrong room, officer.\u00a0\n\nWhat only seemed like 5 minutes went by, and suddenly the sun was up. It\u2019s daytime. Whew, I\u2019m safe. The light always brought a sense of comfort. The guy, Juan, who was staying in my hotel room with me, who, I guess, I considered my boyfriend, was off to work. Really, he was just a john that I had met a couple months earlier, who also did meth. He introduced me to the needle. As he headed off to the bus stop, my mind automatically went back to getting high. He asked me not to leave the hotel room until he got home, but I\u2019ve got money to make. I need to get a shot, and get ready and post another ad. Rent's due at 11. I peaked my head outside the room, and sure enough Juan\u2019s friend is standing at the end of the hall. And he knows how to hit a neck vein.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey! Come over here!\u201d I yelled down the hall.\u00a0\n\nJay comes scurrying down to my room, while repeatedly looking around to make sure that no one sees him come in.\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo you have any shit? I need to go make some money but I need to get high first.\u201d\n\nJay looks at me, and raises his eyebrows, with a half-mouthed smirk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve got some shit. And I can help you out with your room, too, if you want.\u201d\n\nJackpot.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah? But you can\u2019t let Juan know. He'll be PISSED. He doesn\u2019t want me fucking anyone around here.\u00a0 Can you hit my neck really quick?\u201d.\n\nI held my breath, and laid down on the bed, with my head hanging over the edge.\u00a0 I felt the quick pinch in my neck, and then the rush hit. My chest felt like it was about to explode. As soon as the needle came out of my neck, I sat straight up, and began to hack a lung out. That\u2019s how you know it\u2019s a good shot, if you cough. The room spun for a minute and I jumped up off the bed, ready to take the world on.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo how are we going to do this? What if Juan finds out? He\u2019s going to kill me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Jay said, \u201cIll tell him it\u2019s my homie that\u2019s coming tomorrow when he goes to work.\u201d\n\nJay paid for the room, and we had made a plan that when Juan leaves for work the next day, we will have our \u201cdate\u201d.\u00a0 The day and night flew past, doing nothing in particular. Time usually consisted of me panicking because I saw parasites in my makeup, or picking them out of my legs, you know, the usual. The days always flew by.\n\n\u201cAlright!\u201d Jaun said, almost nervously, \u201cIm off to\u2026work\u2026!\u201d\n\nI walked him to the door, and watched him trudge toward the bus stop. Alright, I\u2019m gonna give it 10 minutes before I tell Jay to come over. I\u2019d better make sure my face looks okay. I slipped down to a thong and bra, and went to the mirror to make sure my face looked sexy enough for this \u201cappointment\u201d.\u00a0 Suddenly I heard a \u201cthud, thud, thud!\u201d on the door. It was Jay.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, Jay! Do you have any shit? Let\u2019s get high before we do this.\u201d\n\nHe put the needle in my arm, and instantly hit a vein. Cough. Ahh, perfect.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlright, let me just put my face together really quick, I want to look sexy for you.\u201d\n\nJay let out an agitated sigh. Everyone knew that makeup and bugs were my \u201ctweak\u201d fixation. Jay starts to make small talk, but his emphasis on certain words started to rub me the wrong way. I continued to do my makeup, but I made sure to frequently check the reflection in the mirror, just to make sure he wasn\u2019t\u00a0 doing anything shady.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo, like I was saying,\u201d Jay continued, \u201cmy homegirl got raped the other day. Too bad she didn\u2019t have a gun.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh, yeah, that wouldn\u2019t ever happen to me\u2026I\u2019m too smart for that.\u201d\n\nMy heart stopped for a moment, then began racing as if it was the #1 horse in the Kentucky Derby. Why does he keep emphasizing stuff like \u201cgun\u201d and \u201crape\u201d? What\u2019s he planning? Just as my mind started racing, and I got the uncontrollable feeling of impending doom, I heard whispering. I couldn\u2019t quite make out what he was saying. I pretended not to notice, so he didn\u2019t think I was on to him, but quickly looked in the mirror's reflection to see who he\u2019s talking to. My God, the AC wall unit. He\u2019s whispering in Spanish in to the unit.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo before we do this, I\u2019m just going to call Juan's work and make sure he\u2019s there so we don\u2019t get caught\u2026\u201d\n\nI saw the look of panic in Jay's eyes as he tried to convince me not to call. As soon as I was connected and asked to speak with Juan, the woman on the other end informed me that Juan had been terminated yesterday. Holy shit. They\u2019re setting me up.\u00a0 Okay, don\u2019t panic, just tell him you changed your mind.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I-\u2026I don\u2019t think I can go through with this. Juan would never forgive me\u2026\u201d\n\nJust then, as I looked up from my phone, and into the mirror, I saw Jay standing directly behind me, with a gun pointed pointblank at the back of my head. Click.\u00a0 He cocked it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cCome over here and talk to me.\u201d Jay stated as calm as a summer breeze.\u00a0\n\n\u201cPut the gun down first.\u201d I responded, without a blink, while keeping my eyes focused on him in the mirror.\u00a0\n\nJay backed up, and sat on the full sized bed closest to the door.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he said in a menacing way, \u201cThe gun is on the other bed. Come here.\u201d\n\nI ducked behind the half wall that was separating the main room from the bathroom. When I peeked my head around again, he still had the gun in his hands. I jumped into the 3 by 5 foot bathroom, and shut the door. I just knew he was getting ready to shoot through the door and kill me. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. I called 911.\n\n\u201cHelp me!\u201d I screamed, \u201cHe\u2019s got a gun!\u201d\n\nAs the 911 operator was trying to get details out of me, I heard the hotel room door open, and Jay running out as fast as he could. I finally came out of the bathroom, and jolted to the door to close it, but it stopped. It was Juan's foot.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh my God, and my boyfriend is here! He\u2019s in on it! He was supposed to be at work!\u201d I screamed to the operator.\n\nJuan pretended to look dumbfounded and confused. He began to profess his innocence immediately. But it was an act. I could tell. When the police showed up, and I was still in my underwear, high out of my mind, they didn\u2019t take me seriously. I asked them to stay in the room with me while I get my belongings together because I didn\u2019t feel safe.\u00a0 I grabbed my clothes from the corner and went to put them in my backpack and black trash bags, when syringe upon syringe fell out of all of my clothing, in front of the police. They fucking set me up.\u00a0\n\nFortunately, the police didn\u2019t take me into custody. I stood outside the hotel, and impatiently waited for the program van from my outpatient therapy group to pull up and get me. When I got in the van, I began my unintelligible rant about the set up I\u2019d just been the victim of. No one seemed interested. They just assumed it was a crazy meth story.\u00a0 I asked the driver if I could keep my black trash bag full of clothes in the van while I attended group. She reluctantly agreed, and in to class we went. I can\u2019t do this. I slipped in to the bathroom before the group began, and took a quick shot. The next thing I remember is hyperventilating in the fetal position in the lobby. I can\u2019t breath. Why are they all staring at me? Why isn\u2019t anyone helping me? I can\u2019t breath! Black.\u00a0 Everything goes black. I feel a tear running from the corner of my eye, and tickling my nose, before it falls off into the puddle beneath me.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes, a toxicity\u2026no, I\u2019m not sure what it is. I think it\u2019s meth.\u201d\n\nThe counselor began giving the 911 operator all of my information. I began to choke out the words, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d, believing that I was addressing my dad and children.\u00a0 And just like that, it went black again.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOoh, yeah, look at that ass.\u201d An unknown male voice woke me up.\u00a0 \u201cShakin\u2019 like that makes that ass move.\u201d He commented again.\u00a0\n\nI attempted to sit up, but I was strapped to a hospital bed. My whole body was shaking. I couldn\u2019t stop. I was having a seizure.\u00a0 I was in the hallway of the hospital, restrained to a bed, and this man kept making remarks on the way my ass was moving, as I damn near swallowed my tongue. No one stopped him. No one cared. I was just a junkie. I had no rights.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe hospital quickly put in a call to the detox center.\u00a0 I had no where else to go, and was too frightened to go back to the street so soon, so I grudgingly agreed.\u00a0 I was so shaken, and had recently shaved all of my hair off. My face was covered in scabs. Everyone in the waiting room was laughing at me. I didn\u2019t want them to see me. I put my toothpick sized legs up in to my jean jacket, and hid my face.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one ugly bitch.\u201d I heard a man say. \u201cRemind me to stay away from that dope.\u00a0 What the fuck is she on?\u201d\n\nI ignored it.\u00a0 I kept my face in my jacket, begging in my head for them to leave me alone.\n\n\u201cDamn baby, what\u2019s up with you?\u201d A different man said, mockingly.\u00a0\n\n\u201cJust leave me alone!\u201d I screamed out of frustration. \u201cWe\u2019re all here for the same shit, right? We\u2019re all on dope, right? So why are you fucking with me?\u00a0 Just stop!\u201d\n\nLaughter filled the room.\u00a0\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon guys, leave her alone. I think she\u2019s 'slow'.\u201d A guy joked from the corner.\u00a0\n\nI curled back into my ball, and stuffed my face into the comfort of my jacket. Time usually went as quick as the speed of light when I was high. That didn\u2019t happen this time. Time was dragging. It was almost like torture.\u00a0 They called me such mean and vicious names, and they just wouldn\u2019t stop. They wouldn\u2019t stop laughing at me. And all I could do was sit there. All I could do is listen to what an ugly piece of shit they all agreed that I was. Hours, but what seemed like centuries, later, they called me back. The room was a giant gym filled with cots. This is where they observed you for a whole 24 hours before they decide if they\u2019ll take you in to detox, \u201cin the back\u201d.\u00a0 Fortunately, or unfortunately, if you look at it that way, for me, I was also using heroin, which qualified me for detox. There\u2019s no medical detox for meth. The medical assistant led me to the one cot in the entire gym that was stained with piss. Everyone laughed as she told me that it\u2019s my bed for the next 24 hours. When I asked for new sheets, she snickered as she told me that there isn\u2019t any new sheets right now. I was too tired to care. I plopped down on the dark yellow stained mattress, and pulled my cover over my face.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to uncover your face.\u201d The assistant said in a patronizing way.\n\n\u201cFuck you!\u201d I screeched back, with my head still under the blanket. It was so hard to breath, but I\u2019d be damned if I let them see that they\u2019re getting to me. I closed my eyes, and tried to sleep, but the cleaning chemicals and draino still coursing through my blood stream made it impossible to do so.\u00a0 So I laid there. I laid there in silence listening to them still talking shit. An hour goes by. Then another. Then another. Okay! I fucking get it! Am I that horrible that they\u2019ve really been spending the last 6 hours straight making fun of me? Really?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe assistants kept walking around my cot clicking their pens. I know they were doing it just to mess with me. The first time one of them did it, it made me jump. The click of the pen sounded similar to the gun cocking earlier today. They were feeding off of my fear and agitation. My torment was their entertainment. As the nurse made his way over to my cot to \u201cassess\u201d me, he kept saying things that he knew would trigger me. They had to have read the report from the 911 call. Why else would they keep messing with me like this?\n\n\u201cOkay\u201d, the nurse started, \u201cI\u2019ll just get your vitals, and shoot it over to the other nurses station. Come on. Sit up.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d I was getting defensive now. \u201cI don\u2019t have to sit up. You can get my vitals right here.\u201d\u00a0 I said from an air hole I made in the blanket.\u00a0\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s give this a shot.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWhy was this happening to me? Why are they all fucking with me?\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t even the other addicts anymore. It was the nursing staff, too. It was everyone. Everyone was teaming up against me. They were all in on it together.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTick. Tock. Tick. Tock. The torment continued, with every millisecond that passed by. It\u2019d been about 24 hours now, since the last time I did dope. I felt a tap on my shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, sweetie.\u201d An angelic female voice said, \u201cWe\u2019ve finally got a bed open for you in the back.\u201d She continued.\u00a0\n\nIt had been the first time in days that I felt like a human.\u00a0 The feeling of being a person, however, didn\u2019t last long. Shortly after I got my bed in detox, and laid down, I began hearing them talking again.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou might as well do it.\u201d Click. Click.\u00a0 It\u2019s was a gun cocking. Oh dear Lord, not again.\u00a0\n\n\u201cShe will never contribute anything to society. We\u2019d be wise to end it now. Let\u2019s stop wasting tax payer dollars on this bitch.\u201d\n\nAt this point, I began getting defensive. I didn\u2019t want to yell, because I didn\u2019t want to draw more unwanted attention to myself, so I whispered,\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo it then!\u201d\u00a0 My quiet voice sounded hoarse.\u00a0 \u201cYou think I want this anymore than you do? Do it. Shoot me.\u201d\n\n\u201cPathetic bitch. You want the easy way out.\u201d\n\nClick click.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s make this bitch suffer first.\u00a0 She won\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nAt that point, I\u2019d rushed out of my room. I demanded a peer support. When he came in, and sat aside with me, I spilled my guts. I explained when it started happening, and I told him that for some reason, the nursing staff was in on it. I was bawling. I was so hurt, betrayed, and most of all, puzzled. The look on his face said that he believed me. But the words from his mouth contradicted that. Something was telling me that he knew what was going on, and he thought it was wrong, but he couldn\u2019t do anything about it. He didn\u2019t want them to turn on him, too. He seemed to hint, as he continued.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem like something any of my nurses would do. But if a nursing staff was doing something like this, I\u2019m sure there could be a giant lawsuit.\u201d\n\nLightbulb.\n\nI jumped from my seat and demanded to use the phone.\u00a0 The peer support quickly left my side, and with a blink of an eye, he was gone.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late for you to use the phone.\u201d One of the nurses sneered.\n\nI marched over to the wall that had OSHA regulations, HIPPA laws, and patient rights. I pointed to the section where it said that behavioral health patients have a right to an outside advocate if they feel they\u2019re being mistreated.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all good and fine,\u201d the nurse said with fear coming out of every pore, \u201cbut it\u2019s past phone hours. You can use the phone in the morning.\u201d\n\nFor the night, the harassment stopped. Gotcha, bitches. Just because I\u2019m a junkie doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m an idiot.\u00a0\n\nEvery time I would pass by, the patients and nurses seemed to be motioning signs toward each other. At first, it started with a swipe of the nose. My internal consciousness started telling me that they were doing that to make fun of me. What? Did I\u00a0 have a booger in my nose or something? I\u2019d go to the mirror and check it out. I tilted my head far back, and looked in the mirror. Meth tends to dry up everything in your body, so I had some sores in my nose, but that was about it. Do they think these are boogers?\u00a0\n\nLaughter filled the room next to me.\u00a0\n\n\u201cLook! She\u2019s fucking disgusting who picks their nose?\u201d\n\n\u201cIts dry skin!\u201d I shouted through the wall.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, right, nasty bitch. Go pick your nose some more.\u201d\u00a0\n\nI started noticing everyone, even in passing, would look directly at me and wipe their nose. Every time, I\u2019d run right to a mirror and check my nose. It was eating me up. All I could think about was what everyone must have thought about how disgusting I was. But it was a game to everyone else. They would laugh, talk shit, and insist that there were boogers in my nose, when I could clearly see there were none. I had no idea how they even knew what I was doing in the bathroom. They must\u2019ve had cameras in the bathrooms.\u00a0\n\nDays later even, it just began to become normal to hear people making fun of me, wiping their noses, laughing at the way I showered, or went to the bathroom. Sometimes, I\u2019d cry. Others, I\u2019d talk shit back. Sometimes I even poked fun of myself, first, so they would think that nothing they said would bother me.\u00a0\n\nEventually, detox ended, and I walked in to a co-ed halfway house. When I walked in to my room, the first thing I heard was my bunkie making a deal over the phone.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh my God, YES! You\u2019re exactly who I\u2019ve been looking for!\u201d I screeched.\u00a0\n\nShe looked at me confused. Or he. My roommate was a woman in transition to become a man, and he went by the name \u201cErik\u201d. Erik wasn\u2019t bad looking. Attractive, even. After I\u2019d made it known that I knew what he was up to on the phone, he became withdrawn for a moment.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know you. How do I know you\u2019re not some spy they sent in here?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come on!\u201d. I lifted up my sleeves to reveal my track marks and abscesses.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d he mumbled, with a look of uncertainty....", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "spirituality", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhc5", "subreddit_subscribers": 63766, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My drug induced psychosis that lead me to God, pt 1", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572176694, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dl3i4s/my_drug_induced_psychosis_that_lead_me_to_god_pt_1/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "rue27__", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4kw7kba4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571677161, "domain": "self.spirituality", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/dl3g72/fragments/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dl3g72", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/spirituality/comments/dl3g72/fragments/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571677162, "score": 8, "selftext": "I cant avoid it no more, the demon inside of me just wanting to come out.
